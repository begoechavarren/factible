    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nThis is the story of three plastic bottles, empty and discarded. Their journeys are about to diverge with outcomes that impact nothing less than the fate of the planet. But they weren't always this way. To understand where these bottles end up, we must first explore their origins. The heroes of our story were conceived in this oil refinery. The plastic in their bodies was formed by chemically bonding oil and gas molecules together to make monomers. In turn, these monomers were bonded into long polymer chains to make plastic in the form of millions of pellets. Those were melted at manufacturing plants and reformed in molds to create the resilient material that makes up the triplets' bodies. Machines filled the bottles with sweet bubbily liquid and they were then wrapped, shipped, bought, opened, consumed and unceremoniously discarded. And now here they lie, poised at the edge of the unknown. Bottle one, like hundreds of millions of tons of his plastic brethren, ends up in a landfill. This huge dump expands each day as more trash comes in and continues to take up space. As plastics sit there being compressed amongst layers of other junk, rainwater flows through the waste and absorbs the water-soluble compounds it contains, and some of those are highly toxic. Together, they create a harmful stew called leachate, which can move into groundwater, soil and streams, poisoning ecosystems and harming wildlife. It can take bottle one an agonizing 1,000 years to decompose. Bottle two's journey is stranger but, unfortunately, no happier. He floats on a trickle that reaches a stream, a stream that flows into a river, and a river that reaches the ocean. After months lost at sea, he's slowly drawn into a massive vortex, where trash accumulates, a place known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Here the ocean's currents have trapped millions of pieces of plastic debris. This is one of five plastic-filled gyres in the world's seas. Places where the pollutants turn the water into a cloudy plastic soup. Some animals, like seabirds, get entangled in the mess. They, and others, mistake the brightly colored plastic bits for food. Plastic makes them feel full when they're not, so they starve to death and pass the toxins from the plastic up the food chain. For example, it's eaten by lanternfish, the lanternfish are eaten by squid, the squid are eaten by tuna, and the tuna are eaten by us. And most plastics don't biodegrade, which means they're destined to break down into smaller and smaller pieces called micro plastics, which might rotate in the sea eternally. But bottle three is spared the cruel purgatories of his brothers. A truck brings him to a plant where he and his companions are squeezed flat and compressed into a block. Okay, this sounds pretty bad, too, but hang in there. It gets better. The blocks are shredded into tiny pieces, which are washed and melted, so they become the raw materials that can be used again. As if by magic, bottle three is now ready to be reborn as something completely new. For this bit of plastic with such humble origins, suddenly the sky is the limit.",

For engineers and manufacturers working with plastics, an understanding of monomers is foundational. Knowing what they are and how they work makes it easier to produce useful products that consumers will want. Learn more about monomers, what they are, and the crucial role they play in plastic machining.\nMonomers are individual molecules that, when combined, form a polymer. The term monomer comes from the Greek \u201cmono,\u201d meaning one, and \u201cmeros,\u201d meaning part. These simple molecules polymerize, or bond, to form the complex polymers that we know as plastics.\nThe discovery and understanding of monomers date back to the early 1800s. Notably, the work of August Wilhelm von Hofmann, who first coined the term monomer, was instrumental in recognizing the significance of these compounds in the polymerization process. As the study of chemistry and material science advanced, the role and impact of monomers in everyday materials became increasingly clear. Today, manufacturers in all different sectors rely on monomers for plastic packaging, parts, and components.\nYou can define the attributes of polymer materials according to the monomers manufacturers synthesize them from and the details of the polymerization process they undergo. Here are some examples of these attributes:\nThe specific combination and ratio of monomers, along with the conditions under which polymerization occurs, result in plastics with a wide range of properties, allowing for use in many different applications.\nThere are a wide variety of monomers used in plastic production, which can be categorized based on their chemical structure and source. Some of the most common types include:\nEach type of monomer brings distinctive characteristics to the resulting polymer, influencing properties such as flexibility, hardness, and resistance to temperature and chemicals.\nUnderstanding the role of monomers in precision plastic machining requires a look at the polymerization process and the formation of polymer chains.\nPolymerization is the chemical process through which monomers combine to form polymers. It can occur through various means, including addition polymerization, where unsaturated monomers combine together on a growing chain, and condensation polymerization, which releases a small byproduct, such as water or alcohol, as two molecules combine. The choice of polymerization method impacts the properties of the resulting plastic.\nAs monomers react and link together, they form long strands known as polymer chains. These chains give plastic materials their unique structure, which can be linear, branched, or cross-linked. The length and configuration of these chains are critical, as they ultimately determine the material\u2019s mechanical and physical attributes.\nBy altering the type and amount of monomers used, manufacturers can manipulate the mechanical properties of the plastic. Monomers with larger molecular weights generally produce stronger and more rigid materials, while smaller monomers contribute to flexibility.\nDuring the plastic machining process, the choice of monomers affects the material\u2019s machinability. It can influence factors such as:\nThe extensive role of monomers in plastic machining is apparent throughout the polymerization and processing stages, shaping each final product\u2019s form and function.\nPlastics are ubiquitous in modern life and used in a staggering array of applications. Here are a few examples where monomers play a crucial role:\nPVC and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipes are useful materials in construction and infrastructure projects. The monomers used to make these materials influence their durability, flexibility, and resistance to corrosion, making them ideal for a range of applications, from water distribution to gas transmission.\nPlastics like polycarbonate and various acrylates are essential for manufacturing medical equipment due to their transparency, durability, and ability to withstand sterilization processes. The monomers involved in producing these plastics have to meet stringent health and safety standards.\nWith the automotive industry continually pushing for lightweight yet robust materials, plastics are increasingly replacing traditional metals. Monomers contribute to the production of impact-resistant bumpers, lighter-weight interior components, and fuel-efficient engine parts.\nPerhaps the most visible use of plastics is in packaging materials and consumer goods, which depend on monomers to provide specific barrier properties, color, and texture. Common examples include polyethylene terephthalate (PET) for beverage bottles and polystyrene for disposable cutlery and food packaging.\nThis wide range of applications demonstrates the versatility of plastics, all rooted in the strategic use of monomers during manufacturing.\nMonomers provide the foundation for a material that has revolutionized countless industries. From the pipes running underground to the components in our cars, plastics are integral to our daily lives. Understanding monomers, what they are, and their role in plastic machining enhances our appreciation for these materials and opens doors to innovation and improvement in how we utilize and recycle them.\nAs developments in material science continue, monomers will become increasingly sophisticated, with manufacturers tailoring plastics to meet the evolving demands of society and the natural world. They are the silent architects of the modern age, and their legacy, embodied in plastics, is worth exploring and understanding.\nStarpointe Business Park 24 Todd Drive Burgettstown, PA 15021\nPhone: 724-947-5000 Fax: 724-947-5800\n\u00a9 2020 Miller Plastic Products, Inc, All Rights Reserved\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This toxic liquid accumulates at the bottom of the landfill.\n\nFull Page Content:\nIt's easy to answer what happens to rubbish In landfills in a single sentence. Rubbish undergoes a slow, anaerobic decomposition process without air, producing toxic leachate (liquid) and landfill gas, which contains methane and carbon dioxide. But, if you want to know more about how it happens and why it matters read on!\nTable of Contents\nWhen your garbage truck drives away with your weekly trash, that's not the end of the story\u2014it's just the beginning of a complex journey. Most people rarely think about what happens to their rubbish once it leaves the curb, but understanding this process is crucial for making informed decisions about our waste habits.\nEvery year, billions of tons of waste make their way to landfills globally. In the United States alone, approximately 50% of all municipal solid waste ends up buried in these facilities, despite increasing recycling efforts. EcoSolutions has been tracking these waste patterns for years, finding that much of what enters landfills could have been diverted through better sorting and waste reduction strategies.\nThe journey typically starts at your home, where waste is collected and transported to transfer stations. Here, some recyclables might be removed before the remaining waste is compacted and loaded onto larger vehicles. These vehicles then transport the waste to its final destination: the landfill.\n\u201cWhat Happens to Our Rubbish? PowerPoint \u2026\u201d from www.twinkl.co.th and used with no modifications.\nOnce your trash leaves your home, it embarks on a surprisingly complex journey. Local collection trucks gather waste from hundreds of households, compacting it to maximize space. These bulk waste trucks then transport their loads to transfer stations\u2014intermediate facilities where waste is further sorted, compacted, and prepared for the final leg of its journey.\n\u201cGarbage Trucks Dumping at the Transfer \u2026\u201d from www.youtube.com and used with no modifications.\nAt transfer stations, some recyclable materials may be recovered if they weren't separated at source. Large machinery sorts through mixed waste, pulling out valuable materials like metals that can still be reclaimed. Workers might manually remove obvious recyclables or hazardous items that shouldn't enter the landfill system. The remaining waste is then loaded onto larger vehicles\u2014often semi-trucks or trains\u2014for transportation to the landfill site.\nUpon arrival at the landfill, trucks pass over scales to weigh their loads (this helps determine dumping fees). They then proceed to the active cell\u2014the current working area of the landfill. Here, bulldozers and compactors spread and compress the waste to maximize space and stability. This compaction is crucial, as it reduces the volume of waste and helps prevent shifting that could damage protective systems within the landfill.\n\u201cBOMAG compactors fill the void at \u2026\u201d from wastemanagementreview.com.au and used with no modifications.\nToday's landfills are far more sophisticated than the open dumps of the past. Modern landfills are carefully engineered structures built with multiple protective layers designed to isolate waste from the surrounding environment. These facilities must comply with strict regulations to prevent contamination of soil, water, and air.\nThe site selection process is rigorous, considering factors like distance from water bodies, depth to groundwater, soil composition, and proximity to residential areas. Engineers conduct extensive geological surveys to ensure the location can safely contain waste for decades to come. Once approved, construction begins with excavation and the installation of multiple protective layers, which is a crucial part of waste separation methods.\nBottom Liner: Composite system of compacted clay and synthetic materials Leachate Collection: Network of pipes, pumps and storage facilities Gas Collection: Vertical and horizontal wells connected to treatment systems Cover Systems: Daily, intermediate and final caps to seal contents Monitoring: Groundwater wells, gas monitors and physical inspections\nAt the foundation of every modern landfill lies the bottom liner system\u2014the primary defense against groundwater contamination. This system typically includes multiple layers of protection. First, a 2-foot layer of compacted clay soil forms the base, chosen for its low permeability. Atop this clay layer sits a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) geomembrane, typically 60-100 mils thick (about the thickness of a credit card).\nThese synthetic liners are carefully installed with minimal seams, and each seam is thoroughly tested to ensure integrity. Above the geomembrane, engineers install a geotextile cushion layer and a drainage layer consisting of sand or gravel. This multi-layer approach creates redundant protection\u2014if one layer fails, others remain intact to prevent contamination.\nAs rain and moisture percolate through the waste mass, they create leachate\u2014a potentially toxic liquid that contains dissolved compounds from the decomposing waste. Managing this leachate is one of the most critical aspects of landfill design. Modern facilities include comprehensive collection systems designed to capture this liquid before it can reach groundwater.\nThe leachate collection system consists of a network of perforated pipes embedded in the drainage layer above the liner. These pipes slope toward collection points, where pumps move the leachate to storage tanks or treatment facilities. The collected leachate undergoes treatment processes similar to those used for wastewater, removing contaminants before the water is released back into the environment or recirculated through the landfill.\nRegular monitoring of leachate quantity and composition helps operators understand decomposition processes within the landfill and identify potential problems before they become serious. Some advanced facilities even recirculate treated leachate back into dry areas of the landfill to enhance decomposition in what's known as a bioreactor approach.\nAt t\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Protection from contaminates, no matter what source, is good for all of us. Leachate is one of the most common types of liquid that can seep into our water supply and contaminate it.\nLeachate is a liquid that drains or \u2018leaches\u2019 from landfills. It usually comes from rain, snow melts or from the waste itself. Its composition can vary widely depending on the age of the landfill and the type of waste that it contains. It usually contains both dissolved and suspended materials.\nAccording to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), \"LANDFILLS ARE THE FINAL REPOSITORY FOR A HETEROGENEOUS MIXTURE OF LIQUID AND SOLID WASTE FROM RESIDENTIAL, INDUSTRIAL, AND COMMERCIAL SOURCES, AND THUS, HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PRODUCE LEACHATE\u2014A LIQUID WASTE PRODUCT THAT CONSISTS OF A DIVERSE MIXTURE OF CHEMICALS AS PRECIPITATION OR APPLIED WATER MOVES THROUGH THE WASTE. Landfills are often not the final repository for leachate which can be discharged to surface waters following onsite or offsite wastewater treatment.\"\nWhen waste is placed in landfills, over time the waste decomposes and sweats. This liquid, leachate, is hazardous and must be collected for disposal. Companies who manage landfills have a specialized draining system in place that collects this leachate. The fluid is usually collected into tubes that transport it to special containers. Hazardous waste transporters then collect the waste for proper disposal.\nPrevention of hazardous waste contamination is much more cost effective than cleanup. Doing it right the first time will save costly fixes that affect the bottom line, and more importantly, may solve the contamination problem.\nThe leachate from Municipal Solid waste landfills is a highly concentrated \"chemical soup\", so concentrated that small amounts of leachate can pollute large amounts of groundwater, leaving it unsuitable for domestic water use.\nThe risk of groundwater contamination by any leachate that is not caught by collection systems is determined by the following factors:\nAreas near landfills have a greater possibility of groundwater contamination because of the potential pollution source of leachate originating from the nearby site. Such contamination of groundwater resources poses a substantial risk to local resource users and to the natural environment.\nGroundwater moves slowly and continuously through the open spaces in soil and rock. If a landfill contaminates groundwater, a plume of contamination will occur. Wells in that plume will be contaminated, but other wells, even those close to the landfill, may be unaffected if they are not in the plume.\nLong drought years and occasional heavy wet spells lead to accelerated dispersion of leachate in the surrounding areas causing surface and subsurface contamination. The groundwater quality as well as leachate pollution potential is improved during post-monsoon plausibly due to heavy rainwater recharge.\nIn California, sustained drought conditions could lead to conditions where leachate pollution is compounded by arid soil.\nIn evaluating the human health impact of leachate contamination of groundwater, the pathway considered has been direct ingestion of contaminated water.\nFecal contamination has been detected in leachate samples. Bacterial contamination is generally easy to deal with, by boiling or disinfecting (chlorinating) the groundwater. But again, adding costs that are unnecessary if prevention practices are followed.\nOther contaminates, including heavy metals and inorganic compounds such as: calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, ammonium, iron, sulfate and bicarbonate are not so easy to deal with, and in fact can react with the chlorine used in the disinfection process.\nThis increases both risk and hazard to the public.\nThe vast majority of managed landfills, like BROADROCK RENEWABLES and Western Waste Management already incorporate the latest technological advances in landfill protection. Leachate pipes collect the waste liquid that has seeped through to the base of the landfill. These pipes then transport the contaminated liquid into special containers, which are then collected by a hazardous waste transportation company for proper disposal.\nProper lining of landfills is crucial to keep our groundwater safe. Tests in the middle east have shown that shredding solid waste material has helped the decomposition process, increasing the rate of biological degradation. Also, allowing the waste to compost for a week before covering with soil can improve results.\nLining landfills, to prevent leakage is an important step, as is continued monitoring. Proper hazardous waste disposal must be employed if the entire contamination process is going to be successful.\nProtect our water supply and protect the public's health, it's good for all of us.\nI'll just name the most important thing wrong with this article. Leachate is NON-HAZMAT. Meaning it's hauled out by companies that require no hazmat.

Most plastics can and will break down into smaller ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nJANUARY 5, 2024 | MARA SHULMAN\nOver centuries, wind currents, sunlight, and other natural processes will wear plastic down. But plastic doesn't revert to nature \u2013 it simply goes out of sight. Photo: Shutterstock.\nEven though my children no longer play with toys, I\u2019ve held onto a set of plastic stacking cups I played with as a child. The whimsical animal figures imprinted on the bottoms of the cups make me smile, reminding me of the world of imagination I once inhabited. Understandably, my teenage children have no interest in inheriting this adorable set \u2013 it has served its purpose in our family. But an even bigger issue concerns me. Whether I save it for my family, donate it, or put it in the bin, my precious plastic toy will never go away \u2013 and that\u2019s not a good thing.\nRegardless of how we dispose of it, plastic will not biodegrade. So, what does that mean? Most plastics can and will break down into smaller pieces. Even without human intervention, wind currents, sunlight, and other natural processes will slowly wear plastic down. This process can take hundreds or even thousands of years. But that doesn\u2019t mean plastic reverts to nature \u2013 as a banana peel or a wooden toy does.\nMy stacking cups will eventually break into tiny plastic particles called microplastics. As plastic breaks down, it releases toxic chemicals and carcinogens into the environment. That\u2019s terrifying.\nToday, trillions of these tiny polluting particles \u2013 weighing over 2 million tons \u2013 float on the surface of the world\u2019s oceans. But it doesn\u2019t end there. Scientists have discovered that microplastics can break down even further. Due to their size, these nanoplastics can easily infiltrate our bodies through our skin, food, and even the air we breathe. The worst part? These plastic particles are not biodegradable either.\nPlastic that lasts forever spells terrible news for people and the environment. In the U.S. alone, we produce about 40 million metric tons of plastic annually. And 85% of this plastic will end up as waste in a landfill.\nSo, while I worry about the impact of my plastic toy, what truly concerns me is single-use plastics. After all, I\u2019ve only ever owned one set of stacking cups. Yet, most of us go through hundreds of single-use plastic items in our lifetime. The average person in the U.S. goes through about 156 plastic bottles and 365 disposable bags every year.\nSingle-use plastic packaging makes up about 40% of all plastic produced. This includes bottles, bags, and containers that, at best, will get used for a few hours before becoming trash.\nWhen plastic gets thrown into a landfill, it goes out of sight, but the pollutants it releases persist. In theory, landfills encase waste in enclosed cells. But that\u2019s far from the truth. Eventually, all landfills leak and leach toxic chemicals into our soil, air, and waterways. Because plastic is not biodegradable, it exacerbates this problem.\nIncineration does not provide a better outcome. When burned, plastic spews pollutants into the air \u2013 causing irreparable harm to the health of our communities. And the remaining ash from incineration ends up in a landfill, too.\nOur reliance on single-use plastic is poisoning us.\nBig Beverage companies like Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and Nestl\u00e9 have driven the global plastic pollution crisis for decades, thanks to the single-use bottles they use to sell their drinks. They have done everything they can to maintain the status quo.\nAmong its strategies to avoid responsibility, Big Beverage has invested millions of dollars to champion inadequate solutions like curbside recycling programs. Despite people\u2019s best efforts, these programs have failed. In the U.S., barely 6 % of plastic waste gets recycled annually.\nWhile pushing for curbside recycling feels noble, this tactic aims to put the burden and cost of plastic pollution on consumers instead of tackling the problem at its root. Big Beverage needs to stop trashing our communities. Yet, that doesn\u2019t make recycling obsolete. We have solutions like bottle return programs that help us recycle plastic and other materials effectively.\nHere\u2019s the rub: While recycling can keep some litter out of landfills and incinerators, not everything can be recycled. Plus, the process of recycling bottles and other containers also creates microplastics. These particles expose workers to toxic chemicals and infiltrate our environment through wastewater used to sanitize plastics.\nRecycling alone can\u2019t save us from plastic pollution \u2013 we must invest in zero-waste solutions.\nPlastic is not biodegradable, but that\u2019s no reason to throw up our hands in defeat.

Crude oil is a complex mixture of thousands of compounds and needs to be processed before it can be used. The production of plastics begins with the distillation of crude oil in an oil refinery. This separates the heavy crude oil into groups of lighter components, called fractions. Each fraction is a mixture of hydrocarbon chains (chemical compounds made up of carbon and hydrogen), which differ in terms of the size and structure of their molecules. One of these fractions, naphtha, is the crucial compound for the production of plastics.\nTwo main processes are used to produce plastics \u2013 polymerisation and polycondensation \u2013 and they both require specific catalysts. In a polymerisation reactor, monomers such as ethylene and propylene are linked together to form long polymer chains. Each polymer has its own properties, structure and size depending on the various types of basic monomers used.\nRead more about the various types of plastics.\nPlastics Europe and its members share societal concerns about the European plastics system\u2019s contribution to climate change and the challenge of plastics waste, and the need to foster the sustainable use of plastics.

Rubbish undergoes a slow, anaerobic decomposition process without air, producing toxic leachate (liquid) and landfill gas, which contains methane and carbon dioxide. But, if you want to know more about how it happens and why it matters read on!\nTable of Contents\nWhen your garbage truck drives away with your weekly trash, that's not the end of the story\u2014it's just the beginning of a complex journey. Most people rarely think about what happens to their rubbish once it leaves the curb, but understanding this process is crucial for making informed decisions about our waste habits.\nEvery year, billions of tons of waste make their way to landfills globally. In the United States alone, approximately 50% of all municipal solid waste ends up buried in these facilities, despite increasing recycling efforts. EcoSolutions has been tracking these waste patterns for years, finding that much of what enters landfills could have been diverted through better sorting and waste reduction strategies.\nThe journey typically starts at your home, where waste is collected and transported to transfer stations. Here, some recyclables might be removed before the remaining waste is compacted and loaded onto larger vehicles. These vehicles then transport the waste to its final destination: the landfill.\n\u201cWhat Happens to Our Rubbish? PowerPoint \u2026\u201d from www.twinkl.co.th and used with no modifications.\nOnce your trash leaves your home, it embarks on a surprisingly complex journey. Local collection trucks gather waste from hundreds of households, compacting it to maximize space. These bulk waste trucks then transport their loads to transfer stations\u2014intermediate facilities where waste is further sorted, compacted, and prepared for the final leg of its journey.\n\u201cGarbage Trucks Dumping at the Transfer \u2026\u201d from www.youtube.com and used with no modifications.\nAt transfer stations, some recyclable materials may be recovered if they weren't separated at source. Large machinery sorts through mixed waste, pulling out valuable materials like metals that can still be reclaimed. Workers might manually remove obvious recyclables or hazardous items that shouldn't enter the landfill system. The remaining waste is then loaded onto larger vehicles\u2014often semi-trucks or trains\u2014for transportation to the landfill site.\nUpon arrival at the landfill, trucks pass over scales to weigh their loads (this helps determine dumping fees). They then proceed to the active cell\u2014the current working area of the landfill. Here, bulldozers and compactors spread and compress the waste to maximize space and stability. This compaction is crucial, as it reduces the volume of waste and helps prevent shifting that could damage protective systems within the landfill.\n\u201cBOMAG compactors fill the void at \u2026\u201d from wastemanagementreview.com.au and used with no modifications.\nToday's landfills are far more sophisticated than the open dumps of the past. Modern landfills are carefully engineered structures built with multiple protective layers designed to isolate waste from the surrounding environment. These facilities must comply with strict regulations to prevent contamination of soil, water, and air.\nThe site selection process is rigorous, considering factors like distance from water bodies, depth to groundwater, soil composition, and proximity to residential areas. Engineers conduct extensive geological surveys to ensure the location can safely contain waste for decades to come. Once approved, construction begins with excavation and the installation of multiple protective layers, which is a crucial part of waste separation methods.\nBottom Liner: Composite system of compacted clay and synthetic materials Leachate Collection: Network of pipes, pumps and storage facilities Gas Collection: Vertical and horizontal wells connected to treatment systems Cover Systems: Daily, intermediate and final caps to seal contents Monitoring: Groundwater wells, gas monitors and physical inspections\nAt the foundation of every modern landfill lies the bottom liner system\u2014the primary defense against groundwater contamination. This system typically includes multiple layers of protection. First, a 2-foot layer of compacted clay soil forms the base, chosen for its low permeability. Atop this clay layer sits a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) geomembrane, typically 60-100 mils thick (about the thickness of a credit card).\nThese synthetic liners are carefully installed with minimal seams, and each seam is thoroughly tested to ensure integrity. Above the geomembrane, engineers install a geotextile cushion layer and a drainage layer consisting of sand or gravel. This multi-layer approach creates redundant protection\u2014if one layer fails, others remain intact to prevent contamination.\nAs rain and moisture percolate through the waste mass, they create leachate\u2014a potentially toxic liquid that contains dissolved compounds from the decomposing waste. Managing this leachate is one of the most critical aspects of landfill design. Modern facilities include comprehensive collection systems designed to capture this liquid before it can reach groundwater.\nThe leachate collection system consists of a network of perforated pipes embedded in the drainage layer above the liner. These pipes slope toward collection points, where pumps move the leachate to storage tanks or treatment facilities. The collected leachate undergoes treatment processes similar to those used for wastewater, removing contaminants before the water is released back into the environment or recirculated through the landfill.\nRegular monitoring of leachate quantity and composition helps operators understand decomposition processes within the landfill and identify potential problems before they become serious. Some advanced facilities even recirculate treated leachate back into dry areas of the landfill to enhance decomposition in what's known as a bioreactor approach.\nAt t\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

For example ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nNothing is more critical to our natural resources than our water supply. Protection from contaminates, no matter what source, is good for all of us. Leachate is one of the most common types of liquid that can seep into our water supply and contaminate it.\nLeachate is a liquid that drains or \u2018leaches\u2019 from landfills. It usually comes from rain, snow melts or from the waste itself. Its composition can vary widely depending on the age of the landfill and the type of waste that it contains. It usually contains both dissolved and suspended materials.\nAccording to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), \"LANDFILLS ARE THE FINAL REPOSITORY FOR A HETEROGENEOUS MIXTURE OF LIQUID AND SOLID WASTE FROM RESIDENTIAL, INDUSTRIAL, AND COMMERCIAL SOURCES, AND THUS, HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PRODUCE LEACHATE\u2014A LIQUID WASTE PRODUCT THAT CONSISTS OF A DIVERSE MIXTURE OF CHEMICALS AS PRECIPITATION OR APPLIED WATER MOVES THROUGH THE WASTE. Landfills are often not the final repository for leachate which can be discharged to surface waters following onsite or offsite wastewater treatment.\"\nWhen waste is placed in landfills, over time the waste decomposes and sweats. This liquid, leachate, is hazardous and must be collected for disposal. Companies who manage landfills have a specialized draining system in place that collects this leachate. The fluid is usually collected into tubes that transport it to special containers. Hazardous waste transporters then collect the waste for proper disposal.\nPrevention of hazardous waste contamination is much more cost effective than cleanup. Doing it right the first time will save costly fixes that affect the bottom line, and more importantly, may solve the contamination problem.\nThe leachate from Municipal Solid waste landfills is a highly concentrated \"chemical soup\", so concentrated that small amounts of leachate can pollute large amounts of groundwater, leaving it unsuitable for domestic water use.\nThe risk of groundwater contamination by any leachate that is not caught by collection systems is determined by the following factors:\nAreas near landfills have a greater possibility of groundwater contamination because of the potential pollution source of leachate originating from the nearby site. Such contamination of groundwater resources poses a substantial risk to local resource users and to the natural environment.\nGroundwater moves slowly and continuously through the open spaces in soil and rock. If a landfill contaminates groundwater, a plume of contamination will occur. Wells in that plume will be contaminated, but other wells, even those close to the landfill, may be unaffected if they are not in the plume.\nLong drought years and occasional heavy wet spells lead to accelerated dispersion of leachate in the surrounding areas causing surface and subsurface contamination. The groundwater quality as well as leachate pollution potential is improved during post-monsoon plausibly due to heavy rainwater recharge.\nIn California, sustained drought conditions could lead to conditions where leachate pollution is compounded by arid soil.\nIn evaluating the human health impact of leachate contamination of groundwater, the pathway considered has been direct ingestion of contaminated water.\nFecal contamination has been detected in leachate samples. Bacterial contamination is generally easy to deal with, by boiling or disinfecting (chlorinating) the groundwater. But again, adding costs that are unnecessary if prevention practices are followed.\nOther contaminates, including heavy metals and inorganic compounds such as: calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, ammonium, iron, sulfate and bicarbonate are not so easy to deal with, and in fact can react with the chlorine used in the disinfection process.\nThis increases both risk and hazard to the public.\nThe vast majority of managed landfills, like BROADROCK RENEWABLES and Western Waste Management already incorporate the latest technological advances in landfill protection. Leachate pipes collect the waste liquid that has seeped through to the base of the landfill. These pipes then transport the contaminated liquid into special containers, which are then collected by a hazardous waste transportation company for proper disposal.\nProper lining of landfills is crucial to keep our groundwater safe. Tests in the middle east have shown that shredding solid waste material has helped the decomposition process, increasing the rate of biological degradation. Also, allowing the waste to compost for a week before covering with soil can improve results.\nLining landfills, to prevent leakage is an important step, as is continued monitoring. Proper hazardous waste disposal must be employed if the entire contamination process is going to be successful.\nProtect our water supply and protect the public's health, it's good for all of us.\nI'll just name the most important thing wrong with this article. Leachate is NON-HAZMAT. Meaning it's hauled out by companies that require no hazmat. Reason I know this is because I do it for a living!\nThis is such an informative blog, this blog provided a valuable insight about Leachate that contaminate water.\nDear Steve I worked on Leachate reduction project during the last years and have an idea to reduce the leachate.

But plastic doesn't revert to nature \u2013 it simply goes out of sight. Photo: Shutterstock.\nEven though my children no longer play with toys, I\u2019ve held onto a set of plastic stacking cups I played with as a child. The whimsical animal figures imprinted on the bottoms of the cups make me smile, reminding me of the world of imagination I once inhabited. Understandably, my teenage children have no interest in inheriting this adorable set \u2013 it has served its purpose in our family. But an even bigger issue concerns me. Whether I save it for my family, donate it, or put it in the bin, my precious plastic toy will never go away \u2013 and that\u2019s not a good thing.\nRegardless of how we dispose of it, plastic will not biodegrade. So, what does that mean? Most plastics can and will break down into smaller pieces. Even without human intervention, wind currents, sunlight, and other natural processes will slowly wear plastic down. This process can take hundreds or even thousands of years. But that doesn\u2019t mean plastic reverts to nature \u2013 as a banana peel or a wooden toy does.\nMy stacking cups will eventually break into tiny plastic particles called microplastics. As plastic breaks down, it releases toxic chemicals and carcinogens into the environment. That\u2019s terrifying.\nToday, trillions of these tiny polluting particles \u2013 weighing over 2 million tons \u2013 float on the surface of the world\u2019s oceans. But it doesn\u2019t end there. Scientists have discovered that microplastics can break down even further. Due to their size, these nanoplastics can easily infiltrate our bodies through our skin, food, and even the air we breathe. The worst part? These plastic particles are not biodegradable either.\nPlastic that lasts forever spells terrible news for people and the environment. In the U.S. alone, we produce about 40 million metric tons of plastic annually. And 85% of this plastic will end up as waste in a landfill.\nSo, while I worry about the impact of my plastic toy, what truly concerns me is single-use plastics. After all, I\u2019ve only ever owned one set of stacking cups. Yet, most of us go through hundreds of single-use plastic items in our lifetime. The average person in the U.S. goes through about 156 plastic bottles and 365 disposable bags every year.\nSingle-use plastic packaging makes up about 40% of all plastic produced. This includes bottles, bags, and containers that, at best, will get used for a few hours before becoming trash.\nWhen plastic gets thrown into a landfill, it goes out of sight, but the pollutants it releases persist. In theory, landfills encase waste in enclosed cells. But that\u2019s far from the truth. Eventually, all landfills leak and leach toxic chemicals into our soil, air, and waterways. Because plastic is not biodegradable, it exacerbates this problem.\nIncineration does not provide a better outcome. When burned, plastic spews pollutants into the air \u2013 causing irreparable harm to the health of our communities. And the remaining ash from incineration ends up in a landfill, too.\nOur reliance on single-use plastic is poisoning us.\nBig Beverage companies like Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and Nestl\u00e9 have driven the global plastic pollution crisis for decades, thanks to the single-use bottles they use to sell their drinks. They have done everything they can to maintain the status quo.\nAmong its strategies to avoid responsibility, Big Beverage has invested millions of dollars to champion inadequate solutions like curbside recycling programs. Despite people\u2019s best efforts, these programs have failed. In the U.S., barely 6 % of plastic waste gets recycled annually.\nWhile pushing for curbside recycling feels noble, this tactic aims to put the burden and cost of plastic pollution on consumers instead of tackling the problem at its root. Big Beverage needs to stop trashing our communities. Yet, that doesn\u2019t make recycling obsolete. We have solutions like bottle return programs that help us recycle plastic and other materials effectively.\nHere\u2019s the rub: While recycling can keep some litter out of landfills and incinerators, not everything can be recycled. Plus, the process of recycling bottles and other containers also creates microplastics. These particles expose workers to toxic chemicals and infiltrate our environment through wastewater used to sanitize plastics.\nRecycling alone can\u2019t save us from plastic pollution \u2013 we must invest in zero-waste solutions.\nPlastic is not biodegradable, but that\u2019s no reason to throw up our hands in defeat. We still have time to switch to more sustainable options, such as refillable containers and reusable packaging. Let\u2019s reserve plastic for essential purposes \u2013 like medical equipment \u2013 and work to ditch single-use plastics for good.\nCLF and our partners have pushed elected officials to pass laws to help us make this critical transition.

[4]). Areas near landfills have ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nNothing is more critical to our natural resources than our water supply. Protection from contaminates, no matter what source, is good for all of us. Leachate is one of the most common types of liquid that can seep into our water supply and contaminate it.\nLeachate is a liquid that drains or \u2018leaches\u2019 from landfills. It usually comes from rain, snow melts or from the waste itself. Its composition can vary widely depending on the age of the landfill and the type of waste that it contains. It usually contains both dissolved and suspended materials.\nAccording to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), \"LANDFILLS ARE THE FINAL REPOSITORY FOR A HETEROGENEOUS MIXTURE OF LIQUID AND SOLID WASTE FROM RESIDENTIAL, INDUSTRIAL, AND COMMERCIAL SOURCES, AND THUS, HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PRODUCE LEACHATE\u2014A LIQUID WASTE PRODUCT THAT CONSISTS OF A DIVERSE MIXTURE OF CHEMICALS AS PRECIPITATION OR APPLIED WATER MOVES THROUGH THE WASTE. Landfills are often not the final repository for leachate which can be discharged to surface waters following onsite or offsite wastewater treatment.\"\nWhen waste is placed in landfills, over time the waste decomposes and sweats. This liquid, leachate, is hazardous and must be collected for disposal. Companies who manage landfills have a specialized draining system in place that collects this leachate. The fluid is usually collected into tubes that transport it to special containers. Hazardous waste transporters then collect the waste for proper disposal.\nPrevention of hazardous waste contamination is much more cost effective than cleanup. Doing it right the first time will save costly fixes that affect the bottom line, and more importantly, may solve the contamination problem.\nThe leachate from Municipal Solid waste landfills is a highly concentrated \"chemical soup\", so concentrated that small amounts of leachate can pollute large amounts of groundwater, leaving it unsuitable for domestic water use.\nThe risk of groundwater contamination by any leachate that is not caught by collection systems is determined by the following factors:\nAreas near landfills have a greater possibility of groundwater contamination because of the potential pollution source of leachate originating from the nearby site. Such contamination of groundwater resources poses a substantial risk to local resource users and to the natural environment.\nGroundwater moves slowly and continuously through the open spaces in soil and rock. If a landfill contaminates groundwater, a plume of contamination will occur. Wells in that plume will be contaminated, but other wells, even those close to the landfill, may be unaffected if they are not in the plume.\nLong drought years and occasional heavy wet spells lead to accelerated dispersion of leachate in the surrounding areas causing surface and subsurface contamination. The groundwater quality as well as leachate pollution potential is improved during post-monsoon plausibly due to heavy rainwater recharge.\nIn California, sustained drought conditions could lead to conditions where leachate pollution is compounded by arid soil.\nIn evaluating the human health impact of leachate contamination of groundwater, the pathway considered has been direct ingestion of contaminated water.\nFecal contamination has been detected in leachate samples. Bacterial contamination is generally easy to deal with, by boiling or disinfecting (chlorinating) the groundwater. But again, adding costs that are unnecessary if prevention practices are followed.\nOther contaminates, including heavy metals and inorganic compounds such as: calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, ammonium, iron, sulfate and bicarbonate are not so easy to deal with, and in fact can react with the chlorine used in the disinfection process.\nThis increases both risk and hazard to the public.\nThe vast majority of managed landfills, like BROADROCK RENEWABLES and Western Waste Management already incorporate the latest technological advances in landfill protection. Leachate pipes collect the waste liquid that has seeped through to the base of the landfill. These pipes then transport the contaminated liquid into special containers, which are then collected by a hazardous waste transportation company for proper disposal.\nProper lining of landfills is crucial to keep our groundwater safe. Tests in the middle east have shown that shredding solid waste material has helped the decomposition process, increasing the rate of biological degradation. Also, allowing the waste to compost for a week before covering with soil can improve results.\nLining landfills, to prevent leakage is an important step, as is continued monitoring. Proper hazardous waste disposal must be employed if the entire contamination process is going to be successful.\nProtect our water supply and protect the public's health, it's good for all of us.\nI'll just name the most important thing wrong with this article. Leachate is NON-HAZMAT. Meaning it's hauled out by companies that require no hazmat. Reason I know this is because I do it for a living!\nThis is such an informative blog, this blog provided a valuable insight about Leachate that contaminate water.\nDear Steve I worked on Leachate reduction project during the last years and have an idea to reduce the leachate. I live in Canada and I am looking for any responsible organization who is interested in this subject. Best Regards Mehdi\nHi Mehdi, I am working on a leachate project and am very interested in learning more about your experience in the area.

Plastic Resin Preparation & Melting \u00b7 2. Bottle Forming Methods \u00b7 3. Cooling & Trimming \u00b7 4. The Inspection Process.\n\nFull Page Content:\nThe concept of the circular economy isn\u2019t anything new, but the same approach doesn\u2019t apply to all types of materials. For example, the life of aluminum differs a great deal from the life of plastic as aluminum is infinitely recyclable while plastic is not. Here we explore how a plastic #1 bottle moves through both the linear and circular stages.\nWhat is a plastic #1 bottle?\nYou may not know it, but all plastics are not the same. And, when it comes to recycling, there are a variety of numbers that classify how something made of plastic can be recycled. Products made of plastic # 1 typically include products like water bottles and peanut butter jars. Since over 60 million plastic water bottles are thrown away each day in the US, we want to go deeper into the lifecycle of creating a plastic bottle.\nOnly 1% of water bottles are imported, therefore, nearly all bottled water sold in the United States are sourced domestically.\nCrude oil \u2013 used to make polyethylene terephthalate (PET), the main component of a plastic bottle due to it being both strong and light\u2013 is removed from the earth through large-scale extraction processes, such as mining, drilling, or fracking. In the United States specifically, crude oil is produced in 32 states and in US coastal waters.\nThe extracted oil is then shipped to a refinery where the crude oil undergoes its next step, distillation.\nThe distillation process separates the crude oil into components, called fractions. Each fraction that is separated is a mixture of hydrocarbon chains. The fractions differ in size and structure of molecules and are generally separated into three categories: light, middle, and heavy fractions.\nLight fractions result in hydrocarbons: gasoline, naphtha, kerosene, jet fuel, and paraffin. Medium fractions result in diesel fuel and gas oil. Heavy fractions result in fuel oil. PET is produced from naphtha from the light fractions of hydrocarbons. Naphtha is used to produce the base molecules, called monomers, that makeup PET. Two monomers \u2013 monoethylene glycol (MEG) and dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) or purified terephthalic acid (PTA), are chemically combined to produce a long, chain-like molecule, the polymer PET, in the form of a pellet. These pellets are melted together using high heat and pressure. Then these resins are injected into a mold of a small tube, called a preform. Once heated back up, air is blown to expand the tube open, similarly to a balloon.\nAs it cools down, the plastic water bottle is formed. The bottles are filled with water and sealed for use in the bottling process. These bottles are then transported to grocery stores and other suppliers to be bought by consumers.\nCurrently 30% of water bottles consumed are never put into a recycling bin despite all the work and energy it takes to make a plastic water bottle.\nWhen plastic water bottles and other plastics are collected for recycling, they are taken to a materials recovery facility. All the items are moved onto a disk screen where materials are separated from one another.\nPlastics are sorted by categories and by type. Once enough items (not just bottles) made from plastic #1 are collected, they are packed into a large bale and taken to a reclaiming plant where they undergo mechanical recycling. Here, the plastic is shredded into small pieces, sorted, and washed. The small pieces are heated to create small resin to make more plastic material. Mechanical recycling starts and ends with a polymer product \u2013 however, the long polymer chains are broken down into smaller pieces, limiting the repeatability of the mechanical recycling process.\nIn fact, recycled PET is often used to make textiles instead of new bottles. To solve this problem, companies are developing processes to recreate the monomers or hydrocarbons used to make plastic. With PET, organizations are developing depolymerization to regenerate monomers which can replace crude oil and make new plastic material.\nWhen plastic bottles are not recycled, they are sent to landfill where they can take up to 1,000 years to decompose. Moreover, products made from recycled bottles, such as clothing, often end up in landfills as they cannot be recycled with today\u2019s infrastructure.\nAs we continue to look at our plastic consumption, there are many ways individuals and businesses can reduce dependency. Understanding the impact of how something is made, can benefit how we make purchasing decisions that can have a positive impact on the planet.\nWe\u2019ll e-mail you a printable version.\nTo learn more about how to keep waste out of landfill, subscribe to our blog, or speak with one of our TRUE Waste Advisors to learn how to improve waste in your business.\nSee More Partners\n1-833-RTS-INFO (US) | 888-892-1796 (CA) | info@rts.com Privacy Policy | Terms + Conditions\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Rubbish undergoes a slow, anaerobic decomposition process without air, producing toxic leachate (liquid) and landfill gas, which contains methane and carbon dioxide. But, if you want to know more about how it happens and why it matters read on!\nTable of Contents\nWhen your garbage truck drives away with your weekly trash, that's not the end of the story\u2014it's just the beginning of a complex journey. Most people rarely think about what happens to their rubbish once it leaves the curb, but understanding this process is crucial for making informed decisions about our waste habits.\nEvery year, billions of tons of waste make their way to landfills globally. In the United States alone, approximately 50% of all municipal solid waste ends up buried in these facilities, despite increasing recycling efforts. EcoSolutions has been tracking these waste patterns for years, finding that much of what enters landfills could have been diverted through better sorting and waste reduction strategies.\nThe journey typically starts at your home, where waste is collected and transported to transfer stations. Here, some recyclables might be removed before the remaining waste is compacted and loaded onto larger vehicles. These vehicles then transport the waste to its final destination: the landfill.\n\u201cWhat Happens to Our Rubbish? PowerPoint \u2026\u201d from www.twinkl.co.th and used with no modifications.\nOnce your trash leaves your home, it embarks on a surprisingly complex journey. Local collection trucks gather waste from hundreds of households, compacting it to maximize space. These bulk waste trucks then transport their loads to transfer stations\u2014intermediate facilities where waste is further sorted, compacted, and prepared for the final leg of its journey.\n\u201cGarbage Trucks Dumping at the Transfer \u2026\u201d from www.youtube.com and used with no modifications.\nAt transfer stations, some recyclable materials may be recovered if they weren't separated at source. Large machinery sorts through mixed waste, pulling out valuable materials like metals that can still be reclaimed. Workers might manually remove obvious recyclables or hazardous items that shouldn't enter the landfill system. The remaining waste is then loaded onto larger vehicles\u2014often semi-trucks or trains\u2014for transportation to the landfill site.\nUpon arrival at the landfill, trucks pass over scales to weigh their loads (this helps determine dumping fees). They then proceed to the active cell\u2014the current working area of the landfill. Here, bulldozers and compactors spread and compress the waste to maximize space and stability. This compaction is crucial, as it reduces the volume of waste and helps prevent shifting that could damage protective systems within the landfill.\n\u201cBOMAG compactors fill the void at \u2026\u201d from wastemanagementreview.com.au and used with no modifications.\nToday's landfills are far more sophisticated than the open dumps of the past. Modern landfills are carefully engineered structures built with multiple protective layers designed to isolate waste from the surrounding environment. These facilities must comply with strict regulations to prevent contamination of soil, water, and air.\nThe site selection process is rigorous, considering factors like distance from water bodies, depth to groundwater, soil composition, and proximity to residential areas. Engineers conduct extensive geological surveys to ensure the location can safely contain waste for decades to come. Once approved, construction begins with excavation and the installation of multiple protective layers, which is a crucial part of waste separation methods.\nBottom Liner: Composite system of compacted clay and synthetic materials Leachate Collection: Network of pipes, pumps and storage facilities Gas Collection: Vertical and horizontal wells connected to treatment systems Cover Systems: Daily, intermediate and final caps to seal contents Monitoring: Groundwater wells, gas monitors and physical inspections\nAt the foundation of every modern landfill lies the bottom liner system\u2014the primary defense against groundwater contamination. This system typically includes multiple layers of protection. First, a 2-foot layer of compacted clay soil forms the base, chosen for its low permeability. Atop this clay layer sits a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) geomembrane, typically 60-100 mils thick (about the thickness of a credit card).\nThese synthetic liners are carefully installed with minimal seams, and each seam is thoroughly tested to ensure integrity. Above the geomembrane, engineers install a geotextile cushion layer and a drainage layer consisting of sand or gravel. This multi-layer approach creates redundant protection\u2014if one layer fails, others remain intact to prevent contamination.\nAs rain and moisture percolate through the waste mass, they create leachate\u2014a potentially toxic liquid that contains dissolved compounds from the decomposing waste. Managing this leachate is one of the most critical aspects of landfill design. Modern facilities include comprehensive collection systems designed to capture this liquid before it can reach groundwater.\nThe leachate collection system consists of a network of perforated pipes embedded in the drainage layer above the liner. These pipes slope toward collection points, where pumps move the leachate to storage tanks or treatment facilities. The collected leachate undergoes treatment processes similar to those used for wastewater, removing contaminants before the water is released back into the environment or recirculated through the landfill.\nRegular monitoring of leachate quantity and composition helps operators understand decomposition processes within the landfill and identify potential problems before they become serious. Some advanced facilities even recirculate treated leachate back into dry areas of the landfill to enhance decomposition in what's known as a bioreactor approach.\nAt t\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Charles Moore, who discovered the Great Pacific Garbage Patch in 1997. And, of course, he's talking about plastic.\nMost people reading this will probably have something made of plastic within their line of sight. This material is ubiquitous: we're now producing more than 300 million tons (272 metric tons) of plastic a year, and roughly half of that is intended for single-use \u2014 meaning that it's discarded immediately after it has served its purpose. This has led to a mounting problem of going to landfills, and some of this waste gets blown off course and makes its way into rivers and ultimately the sea. In fact, around 8 million tons (7.2 million metric tons) of plastic pollution enters the ocean every year, where it entangles marine life, pollutes coral reefs and ultimately \u2014 subjected to degradation by water, wind and sun \u2014 breaks apart into trillions of tiny .\nThese particles of plastic look a lot like food to many marine species, who then gorge on the pollution, and end up starving from lack of real nutrition. The surface of microplastics also attract pollutants in the ocean, and end up transporting these into the bodies of animals, with effects we're still trying to understand. There's a possibility that microplastics could be harming humans as well, because we consume them via seafood and even in : in 2019, the World Health Organization called for more research into the potential impacts of microplastic pollution on our health.\nRelated: How much plastic actually gets recycled?\nSo, if plastics are so different, what do they have in common? They're made of polymers, which are molecules comprising many repeating units, in formations that give plastics many of the desired qualities \u2014 such as flexibility, malleability and strength \u2014 that they often share. Beyond that, plastics generally fall into one of two broad categories: bio-based plastics, in which polymers are derived from sources such as cornstarch, vegetable fats and bacteria; and so-called 'synthetic' plastics, in which polymers are synthesized from crude oil and natural gas.\nTo understand why, we're going to look at an example of oil-derived plastic: take the milk bottle chilling in your fridge. This carton begins its life somewhere far more dramatic \u2014 deep in the bowels of the Earth, as crude oil. This substance, pooling in high-pressure chambers within the Earth's crust, is drilled and pumped to the surface and carried through pipelines to oil refineries. Its dense sludge is made up of hydrocarbons, compounds made from combinations of carbon and hydrogen atoms that form chains of varying lengths, giving them different properties. These hydrocarbons are the earliest raw materials of plastic, ready-made by the Earth.\nRelated:\nNaphtha is like gold dust for plastic production, because two of the many hydrocarbons it contains are ethane and propene. These two compounds are crucial to the formation of the most commonly produced and ubiquitous plastic products on Earth, including the type used for that milk carton. But to be made into something that can actually be used to build plastic, ethane and propene have to be broken down from their raw hydrocarbon state into smaller units.\nRelated: What happens inside a landfill?\nRelated: How much trash is on Mount Everest?\nThere are hints of optimism elsewhere, too. In 2016, researchers discovered plastic-eating bacteria, and others have since identified polyethylene-munching worms (this beastie is a caterpillar of the greater wax moth, Live Science previously reported). They've also found enzymes that can be engineered to .\nOriginally published on Live Science.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Rubbish undergoes a slow, anaerobic decomposition process without air, producing toxic leachate (liquid) and landfill gas, which contains methane and carbon dioxide. But, if you want to know more about how it happens and why it matters read on!\nTable of Contents\nWhen your garbage truck drives away with your weekly trash, that's not the end of the story\u2014it's just the beginning of a complex journey. Most people rarely think about what happens to their rubbish once it leaves the curb, but understanding this process is crucial for making informed decisions about our waste habits.\nEvery year, billions of tons of waste make their way to landfills globally. In the United States alone, approximately 50% of all municipal solid waste ends up buried in these facilities, despite increasing recycling efforts. EcoSolutions has been tracking these waste patterns for years, finding that much of what enters landfills could have been diverted through better sorting and waste reduction strategies.\nThe journey typically starts at your home, where waste is collected and transported to transfer stations. Here, some recyclables might be removed before the remaining waste is compacted and loaded onto larger vehicles. These vehicles then transport the waste to its final destination: the landfill.\n\u201cWhat Happens to Our Rubbish? PowerPoint \u2026\u201d from www.twinkl.co.th and used with no modifications.\nOnce your trash leaves your home, it embarks on a surprisingly complex journey. Local collection trucks gather waste from hundreds of households, compacting it to maximize space. These bulk waste trucks then transport their loads to transfer stations\u2014intermediate facilities where waste is further sorted, compacted, and prepared for the final leg of its journey.\n\u201cGarbage Trucks Dumping at the Transfer \u2026\u201d from www.youtube.com and used with no modifications.\nAt transfer stations, some recyclable materials may be recovered if they weren't separated at source. Large machinery sorts through mixed waste, pulling out valuable materials like metals that can still be reclaimed. Workers might manually remove obvious recyclables or hazardous items that shouldn't enter the landfill system. The remaining waste is then loaded onto larger vehicles\u2014often semi-trucks or trains\u2014for transportation to the landfill site.\nUpon arrival at the landfill, trucks pass over scales to weigh their loads (this helps determine dumping fees). They then proceed to the active cell\u2014the current working area of the landfill. Here, bulldozers and compactors spread and compress the waste to maximize space and stability. This compaction is crucial, as it reduces the volume of waste and helps prevent shifting that could damage protective systems within the landfill.\n\u201cBOMAG compactors fill the void at \u2026\u201d from wastemanagementreview.com.au and used with no modifications.\nToday's landfills are far more sophisticated than the open dumps of the past. Modern landfills are carefully engineered structures built with multiple protective layers designed to isolate waste from the surrounding environment. These facilities must comply with strict regulations to prevent contamination of soil, water, and air.\nThe site selection process is rigorous, considering factors like distance from water bodies, depth to groundwater, soil composition, and proximity to residential areas. Engineers conduct extensive geological surveys to ensure the location can safely contain waste for decades to come. Once approved, construction begins with excavation and the installation of multiple protective layers, which is a crucial part of waste separation methods.\nBottom Liner: Composite system of compacted clay and synthetic materials Leachate Collection: Network of pipes, pumps and storage facilities Gas Collection: Vertical and horizontal wells connected to treatment systems Cover Systems: Daily, intermediate and final caps to seal contents Monitoring: Groundwater wells, gas monitors and physical inspections\nAt the foundation of every modern landfill lies the bottom liner system\u2014the primary defense against groundwater contamination. This system typically includes multiple layers of protection. First, a 2-foot layer of compacted clay soil forms the base, chosen for its low permeability. Atop this clay layer sits a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) geomembrane, typically 60-100 mils thick (about the thickness of a credit card).\nThese synthetic liners are carefully installed with minimal seams, and each seam is thoroughly tested to ensure integrity. Above the geomembrane, engineers install a geotextile cushion layer and a drainage layer consisting of sand or gravel. This multi-layer approach creates redundant protection\u2014if one layer fails, others remain intact to prevent contamination.\nAs rain and moisture percolate through the waste mass, they create leachate\u2014a potentially toxic liquid that contains dissolved compounds from the decomposing waste. Managing this leachate is one of the most critical aspects of landfill design. Modern facilities include comprehensive collection systems designed to capture this liquid before it can reach groundwater.\nThe leachate collection system consists of a network of perforated pipes embedded in the drainage layer above the liner. These pipes slope toward collection points, where pumps move the leachate to storage tanks or treatment facilities. The collected leachate undergoes treatment processes similar to those used for wastewater, removing contaminants before the water is released back into the environment or recirculated through the landfill.\nRegular monitoring of leachate quantity and composition helps operators understand decomposition processes within the landfill and identify potential problems before they become serious. Some advanced facilities even recirculate treated leachate back into dry areas of the landfill to enhance decomposition in what's known as a bioreactor approach.\nAt t\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This article explains the chemistry and production processes behind two of the most popular plastics \u2014 polyethylene and polypropylene.\nPlastics are some of the world\u2019s most diverse and useful manufacturing materials. While plastics encompass a large number of materials, polyethylene and polypropylene are two of the major plastic types found in many consumer goods, from car parts to shopping bags to water pipes.\nSeveral types of reactors can make polymers, including fluidized-bed, loop, autoclave, and tubular reactors. Different grades of polyethylene and polypropylene offer a wide range of physical properties, such as density, stiffness, flexibility, opacity, melting point, texture, and strength. Manipulating variables in the reactor, such as monomer, comonomer, catalyst, and cooling media flowrates, can control key quality parameters. Additives and colorings can modify the appearance of the polymer.\nPolymer plants are semi-continuous processes. Raw material is fed into a reactor continuously at the front end, while polymer powder and pellets are packaged in batches. Most sites operate multiple lines with many bins and silos for storage and blending. The plastics are eventually delivered to customers using barges, trucks, or rail cars.\nThis article describes the different polyolefin production processes, their key operating parameters, and ways to use automation for improved quality control and higher throughput.\nIt\u2019s helpful to understand some of the chemistry behind the polymerization reaction to appreciate how the process works and the complexity involved in making plastic. A polymerization reaction starts with a primary ingredient (monomer), such as ethylene or propylene.\nEthylene (C2H4) is a stable molecule with two carbon atoms and a double bond. Polyethylene (PE) is a made by the reaction of multiple ethylene molecules in the presence of catalyst to break the double bond and connect the carbon atoms into a chain (Figure 1). The longer the chain, the higher the molecular weight. Polymers can have molecular weights in the millions.\nSimilarly, polypropylene (PP) is made by breaking the double bond in a propylene (C3H6) molecule, in the presence of a catalyst, to form long chains of three-carbon-atom molecules (Figure 2). The third carbon atom adds a complexity: On which side of the chain will the methyl (CH3) groups fall? They could all be on one side of the chain\u2019s centerline, or backbone (isotactic), they could appear alternately on opposite sides of the backbone (syndiotactic), or their positions could be random (atactic). These arrangements have different physical properties.\nPolymerization reactions will also consume hydrogen, which is required to quench the reaction (i.e., end the chains), and some will involve a secondary ingredient (known as a comonomer). Since the concentrations of these components in the reactor affect the probabilities that specific reactions will take place, the composition in the reactor effectively sets the amount of branching and the length of the chain.\n\u25b2Figure 1. Ethylene is a stable molecule with two carbon atoms connected by a double bond. Polyethylene is made by the reaction of multiple ethylene molecules in the presence of catalyst.\nThe polymer industry employs many catalysts, and new catalysts are developed every year. Different catalysts are used to create polymers with particular properties, even in the same reactor. Each PE or PP process licensor incorporates proprietary catalyst formulations in its reactor designs. Depending on the type of reactor, the catalysts can be solid particles or suspended in hydrocarbon or solvent.\nPolymerization is a highly exothermic reaction, and it requires continuous cooling to prevent runaway reactions. Most reactor systems include an emergency quench that quickly shuts down the reactor if the temperature reaches a predetermined setpoint. Before the implementation of redundant control mechanisms, a runaway reaction could cause the reactor to become completely plugged with plastic. Process designs have since changed and safety systems have been implemented to prevent such incidents.\n\u25b2Figure 2. Polypropylene is made by breaking the double bond in a propylene molecule in the presence of a catalyst. The resulting polymer may be isotactic, with all of the methyl groups on the same side of the polymer backbone, syndiotactic, with alternate methyl groups on opposite sides of the backbone, or atactic (not shown), with the methyl groups arranged randomly.\n\u25b2Figure 3. The molecular weight distribution of a bimodal polymer has more than one peak.\nAlthough polymer properties can be modified somewhat in the blending and extruding steps, the conditions in the reactor set the product grade(s) \u2014 as defined by a few key quality measures \u2014 that can be made. In general, polyethylene is categorized based on its density, the linearity of the molecules (i.e., degree of branching), and its molecular weight (length of the chains). Other polymer qualities, including the molten flowing property, known as the melt-flow index, are a function of the crystalline structure and are also primarily determined by the polymerization reaction. The melt-flow index determines the polymer\u2019s behavior in downstream operations, such as extrusion, blow molding, or film production.\nThe most common polyethylene grades are:\nNo problem.

This is familiar to most people in the biopharmaceutical world.\n\nFull Page Content:\nOur websites use cookies to offer you a better browsing experience and analyze site traffic. By using our websites, you consent to our use of cookies.\nVersatility, ease of manufacture, and relatively low cost make plastics some of the most useful materials for a wide range of applications. This article explains the chemistry and production processes behind two of the most popular plastics \u2014 polyethylene and polypropylene.\nPlastics are some of the world\u2019s most diverse and useful manufacturing materials. While plastics encompass a large number of materials, polyethylene and polypropylene are two of the major plastic types found in many consumer goods, from car parts to shopping bags to water pipes.\nSeveral types of reactors can make polymers, including fluidized-bed, loop, autoclave, and tubular reactors. Different grades of polyethylene and polypropylene offer a wide range of physical properties, such as density, stiffness, flexibility, opacity, melting point, texture, and strength. Manipulating variables in the reactor, such as monomer, comonomer, catalyst, and cooling media flowrates, can control key quality parameters. Additives and colorings can modify the appearance of the polymer.\nPolymer plants are semi-continuous processes. Raw material is fed into a reactor continuously at the front end, while polymer powder and pellets are packaged in batches. Most sites operate multiple lines with many bins and silos for storage and blending. The plastics are eventually delivered to customers using barges, trucks, or rail cars.\nThis article describes the different polyolefin production processes, their key operating parameters, and ways to use automation for improved quality control and higher throughput.\nIt\u2019s helpful to understand some of the chemistry behind the polymerization reaction to appreciate how the process works and the complexity involved in making plastic. A polymerization reaction starts with a primary ingredient (monomer), such as ethylene or propylene.\nEthylene (C2H4) is a stable molecule with two carbon atoms and a double bond. Polyethylene (PE) is a made by the reaction of multiple ethylene molecules in the presence of catalyst to break the double bond and connect the carbon atoms into a chain (Figure 1). The longer the chain, the higher the molecular weight. Polymers can have molecular weights in the millions.\nSimilarly, polypropylene (PP) is made by breaking the double bond in a propylene (C3H6) molecule, in the presence of a catalyst, to form long chains of three-carbon-atom molecules (Figure 2). The third carbon atom adds a complexity: On which side of the chain will the methyl (CH3) groups fall? They could all be on one side of the chain\u2019s centerline, or backbone (isotactic), they could appear alternately on opposite sides of the backbone (syndiotactic), or their positions could be random (atactic). These arrangements have different physical properties.\nPolymerization reactions will also consume hydrogen, which is required to quench the reaction (i.e., end the chains), and some will involve a secondary ingredient (known as a comonomer). Since the concentrations of these components in the reactor affect the probabilities that specific reactions will take place, the composition in the reactor effectively sets the amount of branching and the length of the chain.\n\u25b2Figure 1. Ethylene is a stable molecule with two carbon atoms connected by a double bond. Polyethylene is made by the reaction of multiple ethylene molecules in the presence of catalyst.\nThe polymer industry employs many catalysts, and new catalysts are developed every year. Different catalysts are used to create polymers with particular properties, even in the same reactor. Each PE or PP process licensor incorporates proprietary catalyst formulations in its reactor designs. Depending on the type of reactor, the catalysts can be solid particles or suspended in hydrocarbon or solvent.\nPolymerization is a highly exothermic reaction, and it requires continuous cooling to prevent runaway reactions. Most reactor systems include an emergency quench that quickly shuts down the reactor if the temperature reaches a predetermined setpoint. Before the implementation of redundant control mechanisms, a runaway reaction could cause the reactor to become completely plugged with plastic. Process designs have since changed and safety systems have been implemented to prevent such incidents.\n\u25b2Figure 2. Polypropylene is made by breaking the double bond in a propylene molecule in the presence of a catalyst. The resulting polymer may be isotactic, with all of the methyl groups on the same side of the polymer backbone, syndiotactic, with alternate methyl groups on opposite sides of the backbone, or atactic (not shown), with the methyl groups arranged randomly.\n\u25b2Figure 3. The molecular weight distribution of a bimodal polymer has more than one peak.\nAlthough polymer properties can be modified somewhat in the blending and extruding steps, the conditions in the reactor set the product grade(s) \u2014 as defined by a few key quality measures \u2014 that can be made. In general, polyethylene is categorized based on its density, the linearity of the molecules (i.e., degree of branching), and its molecular weight (length of the chains). Other polymer qualities, including the molten flowing property, known as the melt-flow index, are a function of the crystalline structure and are also primarily determined by the polymerization reaction. The melt-flow index determines the polymer\u2019s behavior in downstream operations, such as extrusion, blow molding, or film production.\nThe most common polyethylene grades are:\nNo problem.

These bottles are then transported to grocery stores and other ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nThe concept of the circular economy isn\u2019t anything new, but the same approach doesn\u2019t apply to all types of materials. For example, the life of aluminum differs a great deal from the life of plastic as aluminum is infinitely recyclable while plastic is not. Here we explore how a plastic #1 bottle moves through both the linear and circular stages.\nWhat is a plastic #1 bottle?\nYou may not know it, but all plastics are not the same. And, when it comes to recycling, there are a variety of numbers that classify how something made of plastic can be recycled. Products made of plastic # 1 typically include products like water bottles and peanut butter jars. Since over 60 million plastic water bottles are thrown away each day in the US, we want to go deeper into the lifecycle of creating a plastic bottle.\nOnly 1% of water bottles are imported, therefore, nearly all bottled water sold in the United States are sourced domestically.\nCrude oil \u2013 used to make polyethylene terephthalate (PET), the main component of a plastic bottle due to it being both strong and light\u2013 is removed from the earth through large-scale extraction processes, such as mining, drilling, or fracking. In the United States specifically, crude oil is produced in 32 states and in US coastal waters.\nThe extracted oil is then shipped to a refinery where the crude oil undergoes its next step, distillation.\nThe distillation process separates the crude oil into components, called fractions. Each fraction that is separated is a mixture of hydrocarbon chains. The fractions differ in size and structure of molecules and are generally separated into three categories: light, middle, and heavy fractions.\nLight fractions result in hydrocarbons: gasoline, naphtha, kerosene, jet fuel, and paraffin. Medium fractions result in diesel fuel and gas oil. Heavy fractions result in fuel oil. PET is produced from naphtha from the light fractions of hydrocarbons. Naphtha is used to produce the base molecules, called monomers, that makeup PET. Two monomers \u2013 monoethylene glycol (MEG) and dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) or purified terephthalic acid (PTA), are chemically combined to produce a long, chain-like molecule, the polymer PET, in the form of a pellet. These pellets are melted together using high heat and pressure. Then these resins are injected into a mold of a small tube, called a preform. Once heated back up, air is blown to expand the tube open, similarly to a balloon.\nAs it cools down, the plastic water bottle is formed. The bottles are filled with water and sealed for use in the bottling process. These bottles are then transported to grocery stores and other suppliers to be bought by consumers.\nCurrently 30% of water bottles consumed are never put into a recycling bin despite all the work and energy it takes to make a plastic water bottle.\nWhen plastic water bottles and other plastics are collected for recycling, they are taken to a materials recovery facility. All the items are moved onto a disk screen where materials are separated from one another.\nPlastics are sorted by categories and by type. Once enough items (not just bottles) made from plastic #1 are collected, they are packed into a large bale and taken to a reclaiming plant where they undergo mechanical recycling. Here, the plastic is shredded into small pieces, sorted, and washed. The small pieces are heated to create small resin to make more plastic material. Mechanical recycling starts and ends with a polymer product \u2013 however, the long polymer chains are broken down into smaller pieces, limiting the repeatability of the mechanical recycling process.\nIn fact, recycled PET is often used to make textiles instead of new bottles. To solve this problem, companies are developing processes to recreate the monomers or hydrocarbons used to make plastic. With PET, organizations are developing depolymerization to regenerate monomers which can replace crude oil and make new plastic material.\nWhen plastic bottles are not recycled, they are sent to landfill where they can take up to 1,000 years to decompose. Moreover, products made from recycled bottles, such as clothing, often end up in landfills as they cannot be recycled with today\u2019s infrastructure.\nAs we continue to look at our plastic consumption, there are many ways individuals and businesses can reduce dependency. Understanding the impact of how something is made, can benefit how we make purchasing decisions that can have a positive impact on the planet.\nWe\u2019ll e-mail you a printable version.\nTo learn more about how to keep waste out of landfill, subscribe to our blog, or speak with one of our TRUE Waste Advisors to learn how to improve waste in your business.\nSee More Partners\n1-833-RTS-INFO (US) | 888-892-1796 (CA) | info@rts.com Privacy Policy | Terms + Conditions\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Here, ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nThe concept of the circular economy isn\u2019t anything new, but the same approach doesn\u2019t apply to all types of materials. For example, the life of aluminum differs a great deal from the life of plastic as aluminum is infinitely recyclable while plastic is not. Here we explore how a plastic #1 bottle moves through both the linear and circular stages.\nWhat is a plastic #1 bottle?\nYou may not know it, but all plastics are not the same. And, when it comes to recycling, there are a variety of numbers that classify how something made of plastic can be recycled. Products made of plastic # 1 typically include products like water bottles and peanut butter jars. Since over 60 million plastic water bottles are thrown away each day in the US, we want to go deeper into the lifecycle of creating a plastic bottle.\nOnly 1% of water bottles are imported, therefore, nearly all bottled water sold in the United States are sourced domestically.\nCrude oil \u2013 used to make polyethylene terephthalate (PET), the main component of a plastic bottle due to it being both strong and light\u2013 is removed from the earth through large-scale extraction processes, such as mining, drilling, or fracking. In the United States specifically, crude oil is produced in 32 states and in US coastal waters.\nThe extracted oil is then shipped to a refinery where the crude oil undergoes its next step, distillation.\nThe distillation process separates the crude oil into components, called fractions. Each fraction that is separated is a mixture of hydrocarbon chains. The fractions differ in size and structure of molecules and are generally separated into three categories: light, middle, and heavy fractions.\nLight fractions result in hydrocarbons: gasoline, naphtha, kerosene, jet fuel, and paraffin. Medium fractions result in diesel fuel and gas oil. Heavy fractions result in fuel oil. PET is produced from naphtha from the light fractions of hydrocarbons. Naphtha is used to produce the base molecules, called monomers, that makeup PET. Two monomers \u2013 monoethylene glycol (MEG) and dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) or purified terephthalic acid (PTA), are chemically combined to produce a long, chain-like molecule, the polymer PET, in the form of a pellet. These pellets are melted together using high heat and pressure. Then these resins are injected into a mold of a small tube, called a preform. Once heated back up, air is blown to expand the tube open, similarly to a balloon.\nAs it cools down, the plastic water bottle is formed. The bottles are filled with water and sealed for use in the bottling process. These bottles are then transported to grocery stores and other suppliers to be bought by consumers.\nCurrently 30% of water bottles consumed are never put into a recycling bin despite all the work and energy it takes to make a plastic water bottle.\nWhen plastic water bottles and other plastics are collected for recycling, they are taken to a materials recovery facility. All the items are moved onto a disk screen where materials are separated from one another.\nPlastics are sorted by categories and by type. Once enough items (not just bottles) made from plastic #1 are collected, they are packed into a large bale and taken to a reclaiming plant where they undergo mechanical recycling. Here, the plastic is shredded into small pieces, sorted, and washed. The small pieces are heated to create small resin to make more plastic material. Mechanical recycling starts and ends with a polymer product \u2013 however, the long polymer chains are broken down into smaller pieces, limiting the repeatability of the mechanical recycling process.\nIn fact, recycled PET is often used to make textiles instead of new bottles. To solve this problem, companies are developing processes to recreate the monomers or hydrocarbons used to make plastic. With PET, organizations are developing depolymerization to regenerate monomers which can replace crude oil and make new plastic material.\nWhen plastic bottles are not recycled, they are sent to landfill where they can take up to 1,000 years to decompose. Moreover, products made from recycled bottles, such as clothing, often end up in landfills as they cannot be recycled with today\u2019s infrastructure.\nAs we continue to look at our plastic consumption, there are many ways individuals and businesses can reduce dependency. Understanding the impact of how something is made, can benefit how we make purchasing decisions that can have a positive impact on the planet.\nWe\u2019ll e-mail you a printable version.\nTo learn more about how to keep waste out of landfill, subscribe to our blog, or speak with one of our TRUE Waste Advisors to learn how to improve waste in your business.\nSee More Partners\n1-833-RTS-INFO (US) | 888-892-1796 (CA) | info@rts.com Privacy Policy | Terms + Conditions\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

About 12% has been incinerated, while the rest \u2014 around 79% \u2014 has accumulated in landfills, dumps or the natural environment. As it stands, just 2% of the world\u2019s plastic packaging comes from recycled sources. Statistics like these are shocking, but they don\u2019t mean we\u2019ve reached the point of no return.\nThe rise of the sustainable, more eco-conscious consumer has inspired companies in a wide variety of industries to rethink how the materials they choose impact the environment. Rothy\u2019s, a San Francisco-based footwear brand, uses a 3D knitting process with recycled PET plastic yarn to make some of their hottest styles. Children\u2019s toy manufacturers are notorious for using large amounts of unrecyclable plastic \u2014 they require materials that are durable and flexible enough to keep up with rambunctious youngsters \u2014 but Green Toys has taken the more eco-friendly route. All Green Toys products are certified baby-safe and made from 100% recycled milk jugs. These are just a couple of examples of the steadily growing sub-sector of manufacturing that runs on recycled materials.\nSustainability in the additive manufacturing industry is still a work in progress, but many companies are already making a concerted effort to reduce, reuse, and recycle. Manufacturing with recycled materials brings us one step closer to a cleaner, greener world. Here\u2019s how the process works.\nProducing just one ton of recycled plastic saves five barrels of oil, removes the equivalent of 1.6 tons of carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere, and results in 80 to 90% energy savings. What\u2019s more, manufacturers that use recycled products can dramatically reduce their material costs. Engineers and product teams can start manufacturing recycled plastic products and reaping these benefits only after plastics have been recycled and processed \u2014 which requires three essential steps.\nThe first step of recycling plastics is sorting waste plastics and separating them by type. This is important because many materials are composites of two or more types of plastic, and these plastics may not have the same levels of recyclability.\nFor example, PLA bioplastics are bio-based, biodegradable plastics that can decompose in as little as three months under the right conditions, but their recyclability can become compromised if they have been mixed with less eco-friendly plastics. Taking the time to sort waste plastics and ensure that they are suitable for recycling makes for better products down the line.\nOnce plastics have been separated, they must be checked for labels or impurities and cleaned. Then, the clean plastic is cut into small pellets, packaged into bags, and prepared for testing and labeling. At this stage, the recycled plastic is known as \u201crGrade plastic\u201d and can be reused in manufacturing if virgin plastic is added. Without the addition of virgin plastic, recycled plastic material needs to be processed in order to become viable for manufacturing.\nThe most popular way to process recycled material is to grind, melt, and extrude it into filament \u2014 the thermoplastic feedstock used in fused deposition modeling (FDM). Recycled plastic can also be transformed into pellets, flakes, or powder suitable for manufacturing using hot washing, crushing, granulation-filtration, and other advanced technologies. Once processing is complete, the recycled materials can be used directly in manufacturing.\nAlthough many recycled plastics do not promise the same mechanical and chemical advantages of virgin plastic, they help reduce the carbon footprint of the manufacturing industry, save engineers and product teams on material costs, and can be used to manufacture a range of high integrity parts.\nWhile recycled plastics and recycled filament face some quality issues today, continuous investment in their innovation and the energy infrastructure of the manufacturing industry at large can help to create a more environmentally friendly future for us all. In order to make sustainability in the manufacturing industry a long-term reality, manufacturers must prioritize materials, processes, and operational models that mitigate energy and material waste.\nThe SyBridge team has years of experience working with the most popular commercial manufacturing processes..

About 12% has been incinerated, while the rest \u2014 around 79% \u2014 has accumulated in landfills, dumps or the natural environment. As it stands, just 2% of the world\u2019s plastic packaging comes from recycled sources. Statistics like these are shocking, but they don\u2019t mean we\u2019ve reached the point of no return.\nThe rise of the sustainable, more eco-conscious consumer has inspired companies in a wide variety of industries to rethink how the materials they choose impact the environment. Rothy\u2019s, a San Francisco-based footwear brand, uses a 3D knitting process with recycled PET plastic yarn to make some of their hottest styles. Children\u2019s toy manufacturers are notorious for using large amounts of unrecyclable plastic \u2014 they require materials that are durable and flexible enough to keep up with rambunctious youngsters \u2014 but Green Toys has taken the more eco-friendly route. All Green Toys products are certified baby-safe and made from 100% recycled milk jugs. These are just a couple of examples of the steadily growing sub-sector of manufacturing that runs on recycled materials.\nSustainability in the additive manufacturing industry is still a work in progress, but many companies are already making a concerted effort to reduce, reuse, and recycle. Manufacturing with recycled materials brings us one step closer to a cleaner, greener world. Here\u2019s how the process works.\nProducing just one ton of recycled plastic saves five barrels of oil, removes the equivalent of 1.6 tons of carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere, and results in 80 to 90% energy savings. What\u2019s more, manufacturers that use recycled products can dramatically reduce their material costs. Engineers and product teams can start manufacturing recycled plastic products and reaping these benefits only after plastics have been recycled and processed \u2014 which requires three essential steps.\nThe first step of recycling plastics is sorting waste plastics and separating them by type. This is important because many materials are composites of two or more types of plastic, and these plastics may not have the same levels of recyclability.\nFor example, PLA bioplastics are bio-based, biodegradable plastics that can decompose in as little as three months under the right conditions, but their recyclability can become compromised if they have been mixed with less eco-friendly plastics. Taking the time to sort waste plastics and ensure that they are suitable for recycling makes for better products down the line.\nOnce plastics have been separated, they must be checked for labels or impurities and cleaned. Then, the clean plastic is cut into small pellets, packaged into bags, and prepared for testing and labeling. At this stage, the recycled plastic is known as \u201crGrade plastic\u201d and can be reused in manufacturing if virgin plastic is added. Without the addition of virgin plastic, recycled plastic material needs to be processed in order to become viable for manufacturing.\nThe most popular way to process recycled material is to grind, melt, and extrude it into filament \u2014 the thermoplastic feedstock used in fused deposition modeling (FDM). Recycled plastic can also be transformed into pellets, flakes, or powder suitable for manufacturing using hot washing, crushing, granulation-filtration, and other advanced technologies. Once processing is complete, the recycled materials can be used directly in manufacturing.\nAlthough many recycled plastics do not promise the same mechanical and chemical advantages of virgin plastic, they help reduce the carbon footprint of the manufacturing industry, save engineers and product teams on material costs, and can be used to manufacture a range of high integrity parts.\nWhile recycled plastics and recycled filament face some quality issues today, continuous investment in their innovation and the energy infrastructure of the manufacturing industry at large can help to create a more environmentally friendly future for us all. In order to make sustainability in the manufacturing industry a long-term reality, manufacturers must prioritize materials, processes, and operational models that mitigate energy and material waste.\nThe SyBridge team has years of experience working with the most popular commercial manufacturing processes..

All over the country, subterranean garbage heaps called landfills are rising, fueled by the 292.4 million tons of municipal solid waste (MSW) the US produces each year.\nAccording to the EPA, in 2018 (which is the most recent data the agency reports), almost half of that trash (49.997%) went to landfills around the country. Worse, yearly MSW production has been steadily climbing, year over year since recording first began in the 1960s\u2014and the US has never had a national recycling rate (recovered material + composting) higher than 35%.\nFor many Americans, \u201cout of sight, out of mind\u201d is good enough. But inevitably, major problems will surface. From hazardous waste to running out of space, we may be overwhelmed by the rising cost of landfills this century.\nA landfill is not to be confused with a \"dump.\" A dump is largely a relic of the past\u2014unregulated, unchecked excavated land where waste of all sorts was piled with no rhyme or reason.\nLandfills, on the other hand, are maintained and regulated by the EPA. Properly managed, landfills accept MSW and other materials from haulers for a fee, layering it in an excavated hole in the ground, covering with soil, and leaving the waste to decompose. From this process, some naturally occurring methane gas and toxic liquids called leachate can be extracted.\nUnfortunately, many landfills aren\u2019t properly managed, and the process is inefficient. The uncaptured methane, for one, is a major contributor to climate change, 84 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. In fact, 2018 numbers reflect that MSW landfills are the third-largest source (15.1%) of human-related methane emissions in the U.S.\nThat\u2019s equivalent to more than the CO2 emissions from 20.6 million passenger vehicles driven for one year or the emissions from powering 11 million homes over the same period.\nAside from greenhouse gases, the landfill-caused environmental crisis runs deeper.\nWaste management has an inelegant history\u2014like how 15th-century Paris was plagued with stinking piles of garbage directly outside its city walls. Our practice of locking our waste far away from people, deep in the earth seems like the most sanitary option available.\nHowever, our waste today is different; our trash heaps can be toxic to humans.\nSource: EPA\nWhat we throw away matters, and when it fails to get recycled (the case 68% of the time), it often heads to be covered over in the landfill. And 21st-century waste can be disastrous for the environment.\nFirst, the natural stuff: Food and yard trimmings make up roughly 34% of all MSW. Under the right conditions, this would enter into a composting process, where it decomposes to become nutrient-rich organic material, often called \u201cblack gold\u201d by farmers and gardeners for its benefits.\nIn a landfill, however, food, grass clippings, and other organic material are densely packed and thus decompose with the absence of oxygen (anaerobically). For that reason, waste\u2014both organic and inorganic\u2014breaks down significantly slower in landfills than it would in nature.\n[More from RoadRunner\u2019s Waste Watchers blog: The Decomposition Clock]\nThrough its oxygen-deprived breakdown, organic material emits methane as a byproduct, making landfills volatile and gassy. But the downstream impact may cost even more\u2014and our discarded technology and something called \u201cforever chemicals\u201d are to blame.\nWhile the methane goes up into the atmosphere, the poisonous, wastewater sludge called leachate goes down\u2014and while landfills effectively work like a big sink for liquids, it\u2019s impossible for operators to contain it all.\nThese toxins can seep into soil and groundwater aquifers and affect local ecosystems, animal-life, and our drinking water. Electronic waste, for example, contains various types of dangerous chemicals, including lead, cadmium, beryllium, mercury, and brominated flame retardants. In 2018, we sent 2.8 million tons of tech to landfills.\nMeanwhile, \u201cforever chemicals\u201d (also known as PFAs), are aptly named. These fluorinated, harmful chemicals are used in a wide variety of products like Teflon frying pans, dental floss, and food packaging\u2014and they never break down in the environment, ever.\nPFAs are in the tap water supply for 200 million Americans, and it\u2019s widely known that they\u2019re found in high concentrations in leachate.\nWhat\u2019s interesting is between food (which releases methane) and chemical-laden electronics and junk (which trickle toxins through leachate), we\u2019re only talking about 35.6% of the total landfill volume. And volume has created a crisis of its own.\nCollectively, the world produces two billion metric tons of solid waste per year. Americans, for our part, rank number one in per-capita waste, producing 12% of the world\u2019s trash despite only accounting for 4% of its population. From the same analysis, the U.S. was determined to be the only developed nation in the world where MSW generation outpaced recycling.\n[More from RoadRunner\u2019s Waste Watcher\u2019s blog: How to Recycle in America]\nFramed differently, of the 96,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools Americans fill per year with MSW, we send between 136M and 150M tons of it to landfills annually instead of recycling or reusing it.\nSource: EPA\nSo, the elephant in the room: How long until we run out of space to bury it all? When does the New York City Metro Area, home to a population of nearly 20 million people, start to look and smell like 15th-century Paris?\nThe answer is complex and speculative, but largely, it depends on where you live in the country.

Our practice of locking our waste far away from people, deep in the earth seems like the most sanitary option available.\nHowever, our waste today is different; our trash heaps can be toxic to humans.\nSource: EPA\nWhat we throw away matters, and when it fails to get recycled (the case 68% of the time), it often heads to be covered over in the landfill. And 21st-century waste can be disastrous for the environment.\nFirst, the natural stuff: Food and yard trimmings make up roughly 34% of all MSW. Under the right conditions, this would enter into a composting process, where it decomposes to become nutrient-rich organic material, often called \u201cblack gold\u201d by farmers and gardeners for its benefits.\nIn a landfill, however, food, grass clippings, and other organic material are densely packed and thus decompose with the absence of oxygen (anaerobically). For that reason, waste\u2014both organic and inorganic\u2014breaks down significantly slower in landfills than it would in nature.\n[More from RoadRunner\u2019s Waste Watchers blog: The Decomposition Clock]\nThrough its oxygen-deprived breakdown, organic material emits methane as a byproduct, making landfills volatile and gassy. But the downstream impact may cost even more\u2014and our discarded technology and something called \u201cforever chemicals\u201d are to blame.\nWhile the methane goes up into the atmosphere, the poisonous, wastewater sludge called leachate goes down\u2014and while landfills effectively work like a big sink for liquids, it\u2019s impossible for operators to contain it all.\nThese toxins can seep into soil and groundwater aquifers and affect local ecosystems, animal-life, and our drinking water. Electronic waste, for example, contains various types of dangerous chemicals, including lead, cadmium, beryllium, mercury, and brominated flame retardants. In 2018, we sent 2.8 million tons of tech to landfills.\nMeanwhile, \u201cforever chemicals\u201d (also known as PFAs), are aptly named. These fluorinated, harmful chemicals are used in a wide variety of products like Teflon frying pans, dental floss, and food packaging\u2014and they never break down in the environment, ever.\nPFAs are in the tap water supply for 200 million Americans, and it\u2019s widely known that they\u2019re found in high concentrations in leachate.\nWhat\u2019s interesting is between food (which releases methane) and chemical-laden electronics and junk (which trickle toxins through leachate), we\u2019re only talking about 35.6% of the total landfill volume. And volume has created a crisis of its own.\nCollectively, the world produces two billion metric tons of solid waste per year. Americans, for our part, rank number one in per-capita waste, producing 12% of the world\u2019s trash despite only accounting for 4% of its population. From the same analysis, the U.S. was determined to be the only developed nation in the world where MSW generation outpaced recycling.\n[More from RoadRunner\u2019s Waste Watcher\u2019s blog: How to Recycle in America]\nFramed differently, of the 96,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools Americans fill per year with MSW, we send between 136M and 150M tons of it to landfills annually instead of recycling or reusing it.\nSource: EPA\nSo, the elephant in the room: How long until we run out of space to bury it all? When does the New York City Metro Area, home to a population of nearly 20 million people, start to look and smell like 15th-century Paris?\nThe answer is complex and speculative, but largely, it depends on where you live in the country.

Despite this, technological advancements and growing awareness pave the way for more effective solutions. Communities, businesses, and governments are working with RTS and institutions to address the problem and develop better recycling methods.\nLet\u2019s explore how to recycle plastics and how we can contribute to the evolution toward a sustainable future.\nPlastic recycling is vital in managing waste and creating a more sustainable future. It supports a circular economy, which reduces waste and reuses materials. Plastic waste has severe impacts on our environment, health, and economy. For example, microplastics pollute our oceans and even enter the food we eat. In addition, plastic pollution costs industries like fishing and tourism an estimated $2.5 trillion annually. These facts highlight just how urgent it is to address this problem.\nStill, solving the plastic waste crisis isn\u2019t easy. Many people don\u2019t fully understand how big the problem is. Efforts to tackle it have often faced resistance, especially from industries that profit from plastic production.\nWhile concerns about plastic waste were first raised in the 1960s, progress has been slow. Thankfully, things are starting to change with RTS at the forefront. We have a webinar on compostable plastics, which you can download to spread awareness of the subject.\nBecause of such initiatives, more people and businesses are learning about the issue, recycling plastic, and making sustainable choices. This growing awareness gives hope for a cleaner, healthier planet.\nToday, consumers and businesses are trying to recycle more, but many lack the knowledge to do it correctly. This often leads to problems like contamination. For instance, mixing non-recyclable plastics with recyclable ones or attempting to recycle plastics with food residue, chemicals, or adhesives can disrupt the recycling process. These mistakes often send plastics to landfills instead of being recycled.\nAnother challenge lies in the products themselves. Items like water bottles, usually made from a single type of plastic (such as PETE), are easier to recycle. However, many products are made from a combination of plastics or a mix of plastics and other materials like metal or wood. These mixed-material items cannot be processed in most recycling facilities and often become waste.\nDespite these challenges, plastic recycling has improved significantly in recent years. The process can now be broken down into six steps, making it more efficient and effective.\nJust like any other waste RTS deals with, we have a process for recycling plastics. Those steps are as follows:\nIn this step, collectors from the government or private companies gather all post-consumer materials from establishments like homes, schools, and other institutions.\nSorting entails grouping plastics into their respective types. Beyond chemical composition, sorting is also done by color, thickness, and usage. This step can be done manually or by machines at recycling plants.\nWashing is the process of removing all the impurities that may impede the following processes. Here, product labels, adhesives, and food residue are removed.\nAfter washing comes shredding, which is basically breaking down the sorted and washed plastics into smaller-sized pieces. In this state, they might be used as additives within asphalt or sold as a raw material. Shredding also allows the removal of more impurities like metals.\nHere, plastics are tested for their class and quality. So, they are first segregated based on density, where testing is done by floatation on water. The next process is called air classification, where plastics are categorized based on thickness. Air classification occurs in a wind tunnel\u2014thinner pieces float while thicker ones stay at the bottom.\nThe final stage of plastic recycling is when the plastics are crushed and melted to form pallets called nurdles. After they become nurdles, they are transformed to take a new shape to make a new product. Please note that different classes of plastics might need specific plants to finalize this step.\nRecycling labels on plastic packaging are designed to help people sort and recycle their waste correctly. However, these symbols can often be confusing. Knowing what they mean can significantly affect how effectively we recycle. Let\u2019s break down some of the most common labels and what they tell us about plastic packaging.\nThe Mobius Loop is a triangle made of three arrows. If you see this symbol, it means the item is recyclable. However, it doesn\u2019t guarantee that it can be recycled everywhere. Recycling programs vary by location, so confirm with your local recycling center.\nThe triangle symbol often includes a number from 1 to 7. This is called the Resin Identification Code, which tells you the type of plastic used.\nThe Green Dot doesn\u2019t mean the item is recyclable.

These mistakes often send plastics to landfills instead of being recycled.\nAnother challenge lies in the products themselves. Items like water bottles, usually made from a single type of plastic (such as PETE), are easier to recycle. However, many products are made from a combination of plastics or a mix of plastics and other materials like metal or wood. These mixed-material items cannot be processed in most recycling facilities and often become waste.\nDespite these challenges, plastic recycling has improved significantly in recent years. The process can now be broken down into six steps, making it more efficient and effective.\nJust like any other waste RTS deals with, we have a process for recycling plastics. Those steps are as follows:\nIn this step, collectors from the government or private companies gather all post-consumer materials from establishments like homes, schools, and other institutions.\nSorting entails grouping plastics into their respective types. Beyond chemical composition, sorting is also done by color, thickness, and usage. This step can be done manually or by machines at recycling plants.\nWashing is the process of removing all the impurities that may impede the following processes. Here, product labels, adhesives, and food residue are removed.\nAfter washing comes shredding, which is basically breaking down the sorted and washed plastics into smaller-sized pieces. In this state, they might be used as additives within asphalt or sold as a raw material. Shredding also allows the removal of more impurities like metals.\nHere, plastics are tested for their class and quality. So, they are first segregated based on density, where testing is done by floatation on water. The next process is called air classification, where plastics are categorized based on thickness. Air classification occurs in a wind tunnel\u2014thinner pieces float while thicker ones stay at the bottom.\nThe final stage of plastic recycling is when the plastics are crushed and melted to form pallets called nurdles. After they become nurdles, they are transformed to take a new shape to make a new product. Please note that different classes of plastics might need specific plants to finalize this step.\nRecycling labels on plastic packaging are designed to help people sort and recycle their waste correctly. However, these symbols can often be confusing. Knowing what they mean can significantly affect how effectively we recycle. Let\u2019s break down some of the most common labels and what they tell us about plastic packaging.\nThe Mobius Loop is a triangle made of three arrows. If you see this symbol, it means the item is recyclable. However, it doesn\u2019t guarantee that it can be recycled everywhere. Recycling programs vary by location, so confirm with your local recycling center.\nThe triangle symbol often includes a number from 1 to 7. This is called the Resin Identification Code, which tells you the type of plastic used.\nThe Green Dot doesn\u2019t mean the item is recyclable.

According to Greenpeace, humanity produced approximately 9.2 billion tonnes of this material as of the 1950s. In 2019, that number was 368 million tonnes, and only 9% was recycled.\nThis low recycling rate highlights significant challenges, from inefficient systems to the complexity of recycling different types of plastics. Despite this, technological advancements and growing awareness pave the way for more effective solutions. Communities, businesses, and governments are working with RTS and institutions to address the problem and develop better recycling methods.\nLet\u2019s explore how to recycle plastics and how we can contribute to the evolution toward a sustainable future.\nPlastic recycling is vital in managing waste and creating a more sustainable future. It supports a circular economy, which reduces waste and reuses materials. Plastic waste has severe impacts on our environment, health, and economy. For example, microplastics pollute our oceans and even enter the food we eat. In addition, plastic pollution costs industries like fishing and tourism an estimated $2.5 trillion annually. These facts highlight just how urgent it is to address this problem.\nStill, solving the plastic waste crisis isn\u2019t easy. Many people don\u2019t fully understand how big the problem is. Efforts to tackle it have often faced resistance, especially from industries that profit from plastic production.\nWhile concerns about plastic waste were first raised in the 1960s, progress has been slow. Thankfully, things are starting to change with RTS at the forefront. We have a webinar on compostable plastics, which you can download to spread awareness of the subject.\nBecause of such initiatives, more people and businesses are learning about the issue, recycling plastic, and making sustainable choices. This growing awareness gives hope for a cleaner, healthier planet.\nToday, consumers and businesses are trying to recycle more, but many lack the knowledge to do it correctly. This often leads to problems like contamination. For instance, mixing non-recyclable plastics with recyclable ones or attempting to recycle plastics with food residue, chemicals, or adhesives can disrupt the recycling process. These mistakes often send plastics to landfills instead of being recycled.\nAnother challenge lies in the products themselves.
