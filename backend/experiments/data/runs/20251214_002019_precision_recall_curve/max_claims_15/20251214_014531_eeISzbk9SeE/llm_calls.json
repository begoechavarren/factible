The ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nThere is unequivocal evidence that Earth is warming at an unprecedented rate. Human activity is the principal cause.\nEarth's climate has changed throughout history. Just in the last 800,000 years, there have been eight cycles of ice ages and warmer periods, with the end of the last ice age about 11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era \u2014 and of human civilization. Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth\u2019s orbit that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives.\nThe current warming trend is different because it is clearly the result of human activities since the mid-1800s, and is proceeding at a rate not seen over many recent millennia.1 It is undeniable that human activities have produced the atmospheric gases that have trapped more of the Sun\u2019s energy in the Earth system. This extra energy has warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land, and widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred.\nEarth-orbiting satellites and new technologies have helped scientists see the big picture, collecting many different types of information about our planet and its climate all over the world. These data, collected over many years, reveal the signs and patterns of a changing climate.\nScientists demonstrated the heat-trapping nature of carbon dioxide and other gases in the mid-19th century.2 Many of the science instruments NASA uses to study our climate focus on how these gases affect the movement of infrared radiation through the atmosphere. From the measured impacts of increases in these gases, there is no question that increased greenhouse gas levels warm Earth in response.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nIce cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that Earth\u2019s climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly 10 times faster than the average rate of warming after an ice age. Carbon dioxide from human activities is increasing about 250 times faster than it did from natural sources after the last Ice Age.3\nThe planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and other human activities.4 Most of the warming occurred in the past 40 years, with the seven most recent years being the warmest. The years 2016 and 2020 are tied for the warmest year on record.5 Image credit: Ashwin Kumar, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic.\nThe ocean has absorbed much of this increased heat, with the top 100 meters (about 328 feet) of ocean showing warming of 0.67 degrees Fahrenheit (0.33 degrees Celsius) since 1969.6 Earth stores 90% of the extra energy in the ocean. Image credit: Kelsey Roberts/USGS\nThe Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass. Data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment show Greenland lost an average of 279 billion tons of ice per year between 1993 and 2019, while Antarctica lost about 148 billion tons of ice per year.7 Image: The Antarctic Peninsula, Credit: NASA\nGlaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world \u2014 including in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska, and Africa.8 Image: Miles Glacier, Alaska Image credit: NASA\nSatellite observations reveal that the amount of spring snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere has decreased over the past five decades and the snow is melting earlier.9 Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\nGlobal sea level rose about 8 inches (20 centimeters) in the last century.

Human activity is the principal cause.\nEarth's climate has changed throughout history. Just in the last 800,000 years, there have been eight cycles of ice ages and warmer periods, with the end of the last ice age about 11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era \u2014 and of human civilization. Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth\u2019s orbit that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives.\nThe current warming trend is different because it is clearly the result of human activities since the mid-1800s, and is proceeding at a rate not seen over many recent millennia.1 It is undeniable that human activities have produced the atmospheric gases that have trapped more of the Sun\u2019s energy in the Earth system. This extra energy has warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land, and widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred.\nEarth-orbiting satellites and new technologies have helped scientists see the big picture, collecting many different types of information about our planet and its climate all over the world. These data, collected over many years, reveal the signs and patterns of a changing climate.\nScientists demonstrated the heat-trapping nature of carbon dioxide and other gases in the mid-19th century.2 Many of the science instruments NASA uses to study our climate focus on how these gases affect the movement of infrared radiation through the atmosphere. From the measured impacts of increases in these gases, there is no question that increased greenhouse gas levels warm Earth in response.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nIce cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that Earth\u2019s climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly 10 times faster than the average rate of warming after an ice age. Carbon dioxide from human activities is increasing about 250 times faster than it did from natural sources after the last Ice Age.3\nThe planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and other human activities.4 Most of the warming occurred in the past 40 years, with the seven most recent years being the warmest. The years 2016 and 2020 are tied for the warmest year on record.5 Image credit: Ashwin Kumar, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic.\nThe ocean has absorbed much of this increased heat, with the top 100 meters (about 328 feet) of ocean showing warming of 0.67 degrees Fahrenheit (0.33 degrees Celsius) since 1969.6 Earth stores 90% of the extra energy in the ocean. Image credit: Kelsey Roberts/USGS\nThe Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass. Data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment show Greenland lost an average of 279 billion tons of ice per year between 1993 and 2019, while Antarctica lost about 148 billion tons of ice per year.7 Image: The Antarctic Peninsula, Credit: NASA\nGlaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world \u2014 including in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska, and Africa.8 Image: Miles Glacier, Alaska Image credit: NASA\nSatellite observations reveal that the amount of spring snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere has decreased over the past five decades and the snow is melting earlier.9 Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\nGlobal sea level rose about 8 inches (20 centimeters) in the last century.

But scientists have found that things like burning coal for power plants or gasoline for cars are adding more greenhouse gases to the air.\nSo what are these gases all about?\nSatellites like the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2, or OCO-2, and OCO-3 measure carbon dioxide in the air. Other instruments like the Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation, or EMIT, are able to measure methane. These powerful tools help scientists see how greenhouse gases are changing over time.\nAqua\u2019s main goal is to improve our understanding of Earth's water cycle.\nOCO-2 is the first spacecraft dedicated to studying carbon dioxide in Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\nOCO-3 is a near replica of OCO-2 and measures carbon dioxide in our atmosphere to help us understand the relationship between plants and carbon dioxide.\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The total cost of these 403 events exceeds $2.915 trillion.\nThe National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) is the Nation's Scorekeeper in terms of addressing severe weather and climate events in their historical perspective. As part of its responsibility of monitoring and assessing the climate, NCEI tracked and evaluated climate events in the U.S. and globally from 1980-2024 that had great economic and societal impacts. NCEI is frequently called upon to provide summaries of global and U.S. temperature and precipitation trends, extremes, and comparisons in their historical perspective. The Billion-dollar disasters product is intended to show the impact of extreme weather and climate events on the economy in inflation adjusted dollars. We cannot control how others use the product, but we consistently note that disaster impacts are a combination of increased risk and the possible impacts of climate variability. For example, the increase in population and material wealth over the last several decades are an important cause for the rising costs. These trends are further complicated by the fact that much of the growth has taken place in vulnerable areas like coasts, the wildland-urban interface, and river floodplains. Vulnerability is especially high where building codes are insufficient for reducing damage from extreme events. This is part of the reason that the 2010s decade is far costlier than the 2000s, 1990s, or 1980s (all inflation adjusted to 2024 dollars). The methodology and data sets are documented in the peer reviewed literature and on the NCEI website. This product has no focus on climate event attribution. The number and cost of weather and climate disasters increased over time in the United States due to a combination of increased exposure (i.e., more assets at risk), vulnerability (i.e., how much damage a hazard of given intensity -wind speed, or flood depth, for example - causes at a location), and the fact that changes in the frequency of some types of extremes that lead to billion-dollar disasters (i.e., National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. Compounding Disasters in Gulf Coast Communities 2020-2021: Impacts, Findings, and Lessons (2024); Multi-Hazard Mitigation Council. Natural Hazard Mitigation Saves (2019)). We also know from research using other kinds of climate and weather data that climate variability can alter the frequency and intensity of certain types of extreme weather that lead to billion-dollar disasters - most notably the rise in vulnerability to drought, lengthening wildfire seasons in the Western states, and the potential for extremely heavy rainfall becoming more common in the eastern states. Sea level rise can worsen hurricane storm surge flooding (Fifth U.S. National Climate Assessment (2023)).\nIn 2012, NCEI -- then known as National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) -- reviewed its methodology on how it develops Billion-dollar Disasters. NCEI held a workshop with economic experts (May, 2012) and worked with a consulting partner to examine possible inaccuracy and biases in the data sources and methodology used in developing the loss assessments (mid-2013). This ensured more consistency with the numbers NCEI provided on a yearly basis and gave more confidence in the year-to-year comparison of information. Another outcome of the workshop was a published peer-reviewed article \"U.S. Billion-dollar Weather and Climate Disasters: Data Sources, Trends, Accuracy and Biases\" (Smith and Katz, 2013). This research found the net effect of all biases appears to be an underestimation of average loss. In particular, it is shown that the factor approach can result in an underestimation of average loss of approximately 10\u201315%. This bias was corrected during a reanalysis of the loss data to reflect new loss totals.\nIt is also known that the uncertainty of loss estimates differs by disaster event type reflecting the quality and completeness of the data sources used in our loss estimation. In 2024, seven of the 27 separate billion-dollar events (i.e., five tropical cyclones, Upper Midwest Flooding and the multi-region drought and heatwave) had higher potential uncertainty values around the loss estimates due to less coverage of insured assets and data latency. The remaining 20 events (i.e., the winter storms and severe storm events producing tornado, hail and high wind damage) had lower potential uncertainty surrounding their estimate due to more complete insurance coverage and data availability. One approach to understanding cost uncertainty is discussed in the peer-reviewed article \"Quantifying Uncertainty and Variable Sensitivity within the U.S. Billion-dollar Weather and Climate Disaster Cost Estimates\" (Smith and Matthews, 2015).\nIn performing these disaster cost assessments these statistics were developed using the most comprehensive public and private sector sources and represent the estimated total costs of these events -- that is, the costs in terms of dollars that would not have been incurred had the event not taken place. More than one dozen public and private sector data sources help capture the total, direct costs (both insured and uninsured) of the weather and climate events. These costs include: physical damage to residential, commercial, and municipal buildings; material assets (content) within buildings; time element losses such as business interruption or loss of living quarters; damage to vehicles and boats; public assets including roads, bridges, levees; electrical infrastructure and offshore energy platforms; agricultural assets including crops, livestock, and commercial timber; and wildfire suppression costs, among others. However, these disaster costs do not take into account losses to: natural capital or environmental degradation; mental or physical healthcare related \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

A number can mean a lot or very little depending on how it is being used, and who is using it. To a Taylor Swift fan, 13 is a lucky number. To many in Western cultures, it is a day of bad luck when falling on a Friday. To others, 13 is just the number that comes after 12. When it comes to climate science and policy, one of our \u201c13s\u201d is the 1.5\u00b0C climate threshold, shorthand for global average surface warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures. That\u2019s the level of warming that the countries who signed the Paris Agreement have agreed to try to stay below. But what does pre-industrial mean? How do we know when we\u2019ve passed 1.5\u00b0C? And what happens if we do?\nThe Industrial Revolution transformed the textile industry in England. This engraving by Edward Goodall (1795-1870), originally titled \"Manchester, from Kersal Moor,\" after a painting of W. Wylde, shows numerous industrial chimneys in the town of Manchester, England, which earned the nickname \"Cottonopolis,\" following its transformation. Image in the public domain, from Wikimedia.\nWhen you read or hear climate numbers, they are often being compared to average. The September 2023 NOAA global surface temperatures, for instance, were 1.44 degrees Celsius above average. That average represents a defined period of time. In this case, September was 1.44\u00b0C warmer than the average September of the twentieth century.\nFor the 1.5\u00b0C climate threshold, the \u201caverage\u201d time range is defined as the \u201cpre-industrial period\u201d, or the period of time before the increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases due to human-emissions began to significantly influence global temperatures. Sounds a bit vague, right? What years make up this \u201cpre-industrial period?\u201d It depends.\nMost history books define the dates of the Industrial Revolution as between the mid-1700s and mid-1800s, but scientific definitions of pre-industrial typically cover some range of decades between 1850 and 1900. Why? Because that\u2019s the earliest time period with widespread, consistent surface temperature records. Different research groups use different parts of the broader time range. For NOAA data, we currently define pre-industrial as 1850-1900. (Footnote 1)\nWhile there can be differences in what counts as \u201cpre-industrial\u201d, it's important to remember that industrial versus pre-industrial is really about the human signature on our climate and how scientists can distinguish that from natural variability going back thousands of years. (Footnote 2)\nHow far the global temperature is above average depends on how you define average. For NOAA's global temperature dataset, \"pre-industrial\" is defined as the period from 1850-1900. For routine monthly reports, NOAA compares monthly temperatures to the 20th-century average. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from NCEI.\nAdding to the nuance, global surface temperature itself can potentially refer to different temperature variables measured in different ways. On land, thermometer-measured temperature variables can include readings at both at the literal ground surface and at two meters above. Over water, ships and buoys can measure the surface ocean temperature directly as well as the air temperature two meters above the water. From high above, satellites don\u2019t directly measure temperatures, but scientists derive land surface and atmospheric temperatures based on the amount of thermal and microwave energy satellites receive.\nSuffice to say, there are a lot of ways of measuring temperatures. And THEN there are different ways of combining those observations into a global dataset. (Despite these differences, all major temperature records show a similar long-term warming trend.) When NOAA releases the latest monthly climate statistics, it uses the NOAA Global Surface Temperature (NOAAGlobalTemp) dataset which blends in-ocean sea surface temperatures and 2-meter air temperatures.\nSo, when you come across stories about the 1.5\u00b0C threshold\u2014especially if you think you\u2019re seeing contradictory stories about whether we have or haven\u2019t reached 1.5\u00b0C\u2014 you should ask yourself three questions. 1) What is the dataset? 2) What is the \u201cpre-industrial\u201d time period? 3) What kind of temperature is being used? Those are the details you need to be able to put that story into context and compare it to other sources of information.\nLet\u2019s go back in time before large international climate conferences like COP28 existed. In the 1970s and 1980s, as climate science was evolving and our understanding of the impacts that human activities were having on greenhouse gas emissions, scientists were using different temperature thresholds to understand the potential impacts of these emissions (Nordhaus 1975). These thresholds usually ranged from 1-2\u00b0C.\nAs the international community has come together to address climate change, it became important to have an agreed upon temperature target as a catalyst for climate action When the first international climate treaty was negotiated in 1992, Parties agreed to stabilize \u201cgreenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.\u201d In 2010, the Cancun Agreement further recognized the need \u201cto hold the increase in global average temperature below 2\u00b0C above preindustrial levels\u201d.\nHowever, research continued to show that for some countries and vulnerable ecosystems, the risk of grave damage rapidly increases at less than 2\u00b0C of warming. So in 2015, nearly the entire world (195 nations) came together at the United Nations-held international climate meeting COP21 to sign the Paris Agreement. This landmark treaty explicitly states that the world\u2019s nations pledged to \u201chold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industr\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The total cost of these 403 events exceeds $2.915 trillion.\nThe National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) is the Nation's Scorekeeper in terms of addressing severe weather and climate events in their historical perspective. As part of its responsibility of monitoring and assessing the climate, NCEI tracked and evaluated climate events in the U.S. and globally from 1980-2024 that had great economic and societal impacts. NCEI is frequently called upon to provide summaries of global and U.S. temperature and precipitation trends, extremes, and comparisons in their historical perspective. The Billion-dollar disasters product is intended to show the impact of extreme weather and climate events on the economy in inflation adjusted dollars. We cannot control how others use the product, but we consistently note that disaster impacts are a combination of increased risk and the possible impacts of climate variability. For example, the increase in population and material wealth over the last several decades are an important cause for the rising costs. These trends are further complicated by the fact that much of the growth has taken place in vulnerable areas like coasts, the wildland-urban interface, and river floodplains. Vulnerability is especially high where building codes are insufficient for reducing damage from extreme events. This is part of the reason that the 2010s decade is far costlier than the 2000s, 1990s, or 1980s (all inflation adjusted to 2024 dollars). The methodology and data sets are documented in the peer reviewed literature and on the NCEI website. This product has no focus on climate event attribution. The number and cost of weather and climate disasters increased over time in the United States due to a combination of increased exposure (i.e., more assets at risk), vulnerability (i.e., how much damage a hazard of given intensity -wind speed, or flood depth, for example - causes at a location), and the fact that changes in the frequency of some types of extremes that lead to billion-dollar disasters (i.e., National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. Compounding Disasters in Gulf Coast Communities 2020-2021: Impacts, Findings, and Lessons (2024); Multi-Hazard Mitigation Council. Natural Hazard Mitigation Saves (2019)). We also know from research using other kinds of climate and weather data that climate variability can alter the frequency and intensity of certain types of extreme weather that lead to billion-dollar disasters - most notably the rise in vulnerability to drought, lengthening wildfire seasons in the Western states, and the potential for extremely heavy rainfall becoming more common in the eastern states. Sea level rise can worsen hurricane storm surge flooding (Fifth U.S. National Climate Assessment (2023)).\nIn 2012, NCEI -- then known as National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) -- reviewed its methodology on how it develops Billion-dollar Disasters. NCEI held a workshop with economic experts (May, 2012) and worked with a consulting partner to examine possible inaccuracy and biases in the data sources and methodology used in developing the loss assessments (mid-2013). This ensured more consistency with the numbers NCEI provided on a yearly basis and gave more confidence in the year-to-year comparison of information. Another outcome of the workshop was a published peer-reviewed article \"U.S. Billion-dollar Weather and Climate Disasters: Data Sources, Trends, Accuracy and Biases\" (Smith and Katz, 2013). This research found the net effect of all biases appears to be an underestimation of average loss. In particular, it is shown that the factor approach can result in an underestimation of average loss of approximately 10\u201315%. This bias was corrected during a reanalysis of the loss data to reflect new loss totals.\nIt is also known that the uncertainty of loss estimates differs by disaster event type reflecting the quality and completeness of the data sources used in our loss estimation.

NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Information.\nAccording to the annual report from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, 2024 was the warmest year since global records began in 1850. The global average surface temperature was 2.32 Fahrenheit (1.29 degrees Celsius) above the 20th-century average (57.0 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.9 degrees Celsius) and 2.63 degrees Fahrenheit (1.46 degrees Celsius) above the pre-industrial average (56.7 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.7 degrees Celsius), which NOAA defines as the period from 1850-1900.\nGlobal temperatures in 2024 were above the 1991-2020 average (red) across most of the planet. Yearly temperatures compared to the 20th-century average (bar chart) show that it has been 48 years since Earth had a cooler-than-average year. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe 2024 global temperature anomaly (anomaly means \u201cdifference from average\u201d) is 0.18 degrees F (0.10 degrees C) warmer than the previous record, set the year before, in 2023. The ten warmest years in the 175-year record have all occurred during the last decade (2015\u20132024). When the new century started in 2000, the first year to set a new high-temperature record was 2005. Now, 2005 is just the 13th-warmest year on record.\nOther 2024 rankings included...\nFor more regional details and 2024 climate statistics, see the 2024 Global Climate Report from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe global average surface temperature is an indicator of the state of Earth\u2019s energy balance: how much sunlight it absorbs minus how much heat it radiates back to space. When these amounts are the same, Earth\u2019s average surface temperature remains steady. When they are out of balance, Earth cools or warms. Earth\u2019s average surface temperature has been rising because human-produced greenhouse gases are causing Earth to absorb more energy than it radiates back to space.\nGiven the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of added heat energy to raise Earth\u2019s average surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree-Fahrenheit (1-degree-Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1850-1900 in NOAA's record) might seem small, but it represents a significant increase in heat energy circulating through all parts of the Earth system, including the oceans, frozen landscapes, and the atmosphere.\nBeyond being an indicator of changes in Earth\u2019s energy balance, surface temperature matters because it controls many environmental and ecological processes that are important to humans and other life, including the water cycle (evaporation, clouds, surface water supplies, and precipitation), the carbon cycle, and the kinds of plants, animals, and other living things that can survive in different places on Earth.\nThe concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (55 degrees Celsius) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the \"average\" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget, which can only be directly measured from space.\nTo calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute temperature readings to temperature anomalies\u2014the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend.\nAcross inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and known physical relationships\u2014such as the way temperature decreases with altitude\u2014to estimate the missing values. Each value is then used to calculate a global-scale temperature anomaly. This process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in Earth's surface temperature over time. Read more about how the global surface temperature record is built in our Climate Data Primer.\nTemperature change has not been uniform across the planet, but more areas are warming than cooling. And the rate of warming has accelerated in recent decades. According to NOAA's 2024 Annual Climate Report the combined land and ocean temperature has warmed at an average rate of 0.11 degrees Fahrenheit (0.06 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1850 and more than three times that rate (0.36 degrees Fahrenheit, or 0.20 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1975.\nRecent rates of global warming (1994-2024, bottom) are larger than the longer-term average rates (1901-2024, top). Places that have cooled are colored blue; places that have warmed are colored yellow, orange, or red. In the past three decades, many places in the Northern Hemisphere have warmed by 1 degree Fahrenheit or more per decade. Differences are most dramatic in the Arctic. With the decline of ice and snow, the Arctic reflects less incoming sunlight, which amplifies the rate of greenhouse-gas-driven warming. NOAA Climate.gov, based o\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

A number can mean a lot or very little depending on how it is being used, and who is using it. To a Taylor Swift fan, 13 is a lucky number. To many in Western cultures, it is a day of bad luck when falling on a Friday. To others, 13 is just the number that comes after 12. When it comes to climate science and policy, one of our \u201c13s\u201d is the 1.5\u00b0C climate threshold, shorthand for global average surface warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures. That\u2019s the level of warming that the countries who signed the Paris Agreement have agreed to try to stay below. But what does pre-industrial mean? How do we know when we\u2019ve passed 1.5\u00b0C? And what happens if we do?\nThe Industrial Revolution transformed the textile industry in England. This engraving by Edward Goodall (1795-1870), originally titled \"Manchester, from Kersal Moor,\" after a painting of W. Wylde, shows numerous industrial chimneys in the town of Manchester, England, which earned the nickname \"Cottonopolis,\" following its transformation. Image in the public domain, from Wikimedia.\nWhen you read or hear climate numbers, they are often being compared to average. The September 2023 NOAA global surface temperatures, for instance, were 1.44 degrees Celsius above average. That average represents a defined period of time. In this case, September was 1.44\u00b0C warmer than the average September of the twentieth century.\nFor the 1.5\u00b0C climate threshold, the \u201caverage\u201d time range is defined as the \u201cpre-industrial period\u201d, or the period of time before the increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases due to human-emissions began to significantly influence global temperatures. Sounds a bit vague, right? What years make up this \u201cpre-industrial period?\u201d It depends.\nMost history books define the dates of the Industrial Revolution as between the mid-1700s and mid-1800s, but scientific definitions of pre-industrial typically cover some range of decades between 1850 and 1900. Why? Because that\u2019s the earliest time period with widespread, consistent surface temperature records. Different research groups use different parts of the broader time range. For NOAA data, we currently define pre-industrial as 1850-1900. (Footnote 1)\nWhile there can be differences in what counts as \u201cpre-industrial\u201d, it's important to remember that industrial versus pre-industrial is really about the human signature on our climate and how scientists can distinguish that from natural variability going back thousands of years. (Footnote 2)\nHow far the global temperature is above average depends on how you define average. For NOAA's global temperature dataset, \"pre-industrial\" is defined as the period from 1850-1900. For routine monthly reports, NOAA compares monthly temperatures to the 20th-century average. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from NCEI.\nAdding to the nuance, global surface temperature itself can potentially refer to different temperature variables measured in different ways. On land, thermometer-measured temperature variables can include readings at both at the literal ground surface and at two meters above. Over water, ships and buoys can measure the surface ocean temperature directly as well as the air temperature two meters above the water. From high above, satellites don\u2019t directly measure temperatures, but scientists derive land surface and atmospheric temperatures based on the amount of thermal and microwave energy satellites receive.\nSuffice to say, there are a lot of ways of measuring temperatures. And THEN there are different ways of combining those observations into a global dataset. (Despite these differences, all major temperature records show a similar long-term warming trend.) When NOAA releases the latest monthly climate statistics, it uses the NOAA Global Surface Temperature (NOAAGlobalTemp) dataset which blends in-ocean sea surface temperatures and 2-meter air temperatures.\nSo, when you come across stories about the 1.5\u00b0C threshold\u2014especially if you think you\u2019re seeing contradictory stories about whether we have or haven\u2019t reached 1.5\u00b0C\u2014 you should ask yourself three questions. 1) What is the dataset? 2) What is the \u201cpre-industrial\u201d time period? 3) What kind of temperature is being used? Those are the details you need to be able to put that story into context and compare it to other sources of information.\nLet\u2019s go back in time before large international climate conferences like COP28 existed. In the 1970s and 1980s, as climate science was evolving and our understanding of the impacts that human activities were having on greenhouse gas emissions, scientists were using different temperature thresholds to understand the potential impacts of these emissions (Nordhaus 1975). These thresholds usually ranged from 1-2\u00b0C.\nAs the international community has come together to address climate change, it became important to have an agreed upon temperature target as a catalyst for climate action When the first international climate treaty was negotiated in 1992, Parties agreed to stabilize \u201cgreenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.\u201d In 2010, the Cancun Agreement further recognized the need \u201cto hold the increase in global average temperature below 2\u00b0C above preindustrial levels\u201d.\nHowever, research continued to show that for some countries and vulnerable ecosystems, the risk of grave damage rapidly increases at less than 2\u00b0C of warming. So in 2015, nearly the entire world (195 nations) came together at the United Nations-held international climate meeting COP21 to sign the Paris Agreement. This landmark treaty explicitly states that the world\u2019s nations pledged to \u201chold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industr\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

As part of its responsibility of monitoring and assessing the climate, NCEI tracked and evaluated climate events in the U.S. and globally from 1980-2024 that had great economic and societal impacts. NCEI is frequently called upon to provide summaries of global and U.S. temperature and precipitation trends, extremes, and comparisons in their historical perspective. The Billion-dollar disasters product is intended to show the impact of extreme weather and climate events on the economy in inflation adjusted dollars. We cannot control how others use the product, but we consistently note that disaster impacts are a combination of increased risk and the possible impacts of climate variability. For example, the increase in population and material wealth over the last several decades are an important cause for the rising costs. These trends are further complicated by the fact that much of the growth has taken place in vulnerable areas like coasts, the wildland-urban interface, and river floodplains. Vulnerability is especially high where building codes are insufficient for reducing damage from extreme events. This is part of the reason that the 2010s decade is far costlier than the 2000s, 1990s, or 1980s (all inflation adjusted to 2024 dollars). The methodology and data sets are documented in the peer reviewed literature and on the NCEI website. This product has no focus on climate event attribution. The number and cost of weather and climate disasters increased over time in the United States due to a combination of increased exposure (i.e., more assets at risk), vulnerability (i.e., how much damage a hazard of given intensity -wind speed, or flood depth, for example - causes at a location), and the fact that changes in the frequency of some types of extremes that lead to billion-dollar disasters (i.e., National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. Compounding Disasters in Gulf Coast Communities 2020-2021: Impacts, Findings, and Lessons (2024); Multi-Hazard Mitigation Council. Natural Hazard Mitigation Saves (2019)). We also know from research using other kinds of climate and weather data that climate variability can alter the frequency and intensity of certain types of extreme weather that lead to billion-dollar disasters - most notably the rise in vulnerability to drought, lengthening wildfire seasons in the Western states, and the potential for extremely heavy rainfall becoming more common in the eastern states. Sea level rise can worsen hurricane storm surge flooding (Fifth U.S. National Climate Assessment (2023)).\nIn 2012, NCEI -- then known as National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) -- reviewed its methodology on how it develops Billion-dollar Disasters. NCEI held a workshop with economic experts (May, 2012) and worked with a consulting partner to examine possible inaccuracy and biases in the data sources and methodology used in developing the loss assessments (mid-2013). This ensured more consistency with the numbers NCEI provided on a yearly basis and gave more confidence in the year-to-year comparison of information. Another outcome of the workshop was a published peer-reviewed article \"U.S. Billion-dollar Weather and Climate Disasters: Data Sources, Trends, Accuracy and Biases\" (Smith and Katz, 2013). This research found the net effect of all biases appears to be an underestimation of average loss. In particular, it is shown that the factor approach can result in an underestimation of average loss of approximately 10\u201315%. This bias was corrected during a reanalysis of the loss data to reflect new loss totals.\nIt is also known that the uncertainty of loss estimates differs by disaster event type reflecting the quality and completeness of the data sources used in our loss estimation. In 2024, seven of the 27 separate billion-dollar events (i.e., five tropical cyclones, Upper Midwest Flooding and the multi-region drought and heatwave) had higher potential uncertainty values around the loss estimates due to less coverage of insured assets and data latency. The remaining 20 events (i.e., the winter storms and severe storm events producing tornado, hail and high wind damage) had lower potential uncertainty surrounding their estimate due to more complete insurance coverage and data availability. One approach to understanding cost uncertainty is discussed in the peer-reviewed article \"Quantifying Uncertainty and Variable Sensitivity within the U.S. Billion-dollar Weather and Climate Disaster Cost Estimates\" (Smith and Matthews, 2015).\nIn performing these disaster cost assessments these statistics were developed using the most comprehensive public and private sector sources and represent the estimated total costs of these events -- that is, the costs in terms of dollars that would not have been incurred had the event not taken place. More than one dozen public and private sector data sources help capture the total, direct costs (both insured and uninsured) of the weather and climate events. These costs include: physical damage to residential, commercial, and municipal buildings; material assets (content) within buildings; time element losses such as business interruption or loss of living quarters; damage to vehicles and boats; public assets including roads, bridges, levees; electrical infrastructure and offshore energy platforms; agricultural assets including crops, livestock, and commercial timber; and wildfire suppression costs, among others. However, these disaster costs do not take into account losses to: natural capital or environmental degradation; mental or physical healthcare related \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Regions such as the U.S. Southwest, where droughts are ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nHere's how you know\nFrequently Asked Questions\nDrought is a serious environmental threat across the United States. Climate change exacerbates droughts by making them more frequent, longer, and more severe. The USGS works with state and federal partners to study, monitor, and help mitigate drought impacts across the U.S. now and into the future.\nCheck out the USGS Drought Website to see up-to-date news, science, and publications on drought and water supply.\nThe USGS Water Science School teaches people of all ages about water! Check out some of their pages related to drought, groundwater, and water management to understand the effects of climate-induced droughts on human communities.\nDefining drought may seem easy. If an area receives less rain or snow than expected over the course of a year, it can be classified as being in drought. The severity of drought increases over time depending on how long an area remains arid. However, there\u2019s more to the story than solely if there isn\u2019t enough rain or snow.\nDroughts don\u2019t just affect water stored in wetlands, lakes, and rivers, but also water below ground stored in aquifers and in the soil. When this groundwater gets used up, the dry ground can act like a sponge, sucking surface water straight in. The surface water-groundwater relationship gets even more complicated with snowpack. If snow melts too early in the year, water can move through the environment too quickly, causing the ground to dry up and become \u201cthirsty\u201d too soon. So even if there is \u201cenough\u201d water, the timing of the water may dictate whether an area is in a drought.\nClimate change has further altered the natural pattern of droughts, making them more frequent, longer, and more severe. Since 2000, the western United States is experiencing some of the driest conditions on record. The southwestern U.S., in particular, is going through an unprecedented period of extreme drought. This will have lasting impacts on the environment and those who rely on it.\nThe USGS employs its wide range of scientific expertise to study how droughts affect human and natural communities and how to effectively predict, prepare for, manage, and recover from water shortages. USGS research spans geographic and temporal scales, exploring everything from short, local \u201cflash\u201d droughts to long-term, large-scale \u201cmega\u201d droughts.\nOur science helps to:\nThe USGS actively coordinates our drought research efforts among our many diverse scientists. Experts like water scientists, wildlife biologists, and geologists all work together to study droughts and their impacts. This effort strengthens our existing observation networks by investing in real-time data collection on rainfall, stream flows, and environmental impacts. With these improved data sets, USGS scientists are working to better understand when and how droughts occur. We are also developing models to help predict which communities and landscapes may be vulnerable to future droughts, as well as when, how long, and how severe those droughts might be. We provide this information to help cities and natural resource managers develop plans to prepare for future droughts and lessen the impacts of droughts on natural and human communities.\nUSGS Headquarters 12201 Sunrise Valley Drive Reston, VA 20192 United States\n12201 Sunrise Valley Drive MS 516 Reston, VA 20192 United States\nDo Droughts Affect Groundwater Quality?

Record-breaking heat waves on land and in the ocean, drenching rains, severe floods, years-long droughts, extreme wildfires, and widespread flooding during hurricanes are all becoming more frequent and more intense.\nHuman actions since the Industrial Revolution, primarily the burning of fossil fuels, have caused greenhouse gases to rapidly rise in the atmosphere. As carbon dioxide, methane, and other gases increase, they act as a blanket, trapping heat and warming the planet. In response, Earth\u2019s air and ocean temperatures warm. This warming affects the water cycle, shifts weather patterns, and melts land ice \u2014 all impacts that can make extreme weather worse.\nAccording to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\u2019s Sixth Assessment Report released in 2021, the human-caused rise in greenhouse gases has increased the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. NASA\u2019s satellite missions, including the upcoming Earth System Observatory, provide vital data for monitoring and responding to extreme weather events.\nResearch says all the risks from these extreme weather events will escalate the more the planet warms. However, IPCC\u2019s Sixth Assessment Report also describes some climate change mitigation strategies, technological developments, and methods for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\nScientists use a combination of climate models (simulations) and land, air, sea, and space-based observations to research how extreme weather events change over time. First, scientists examine historical records to determine the frequency and intensity of past events. Many of these long-term records date back to the 1950s, though some start in the 1800s. Then scientists use climate models to see if the number or strength of these events is changing, or will change, due to increasing greenhouse gases when compared to what has happened historically.\nREAD MORE\nIPCC Assessment Report 6 \u2013 Working Group I \u2013 Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis\nIPCC Assessment Report 6 \u2013 Working Group II \u2013 Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability\nIPCC Assessment Report 6 \u2013 Working Group III \u2013 Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change\nNASA Global Climate Change - Mitigation and Adaptation\nNASA Global Climate Change - Extreme Makeover: Human Activities Are Making Some Extreme Events More Frequent or Intense\nHeader image is of a corn field impacted by drought in Texas on December 1, 2016.

(Image credit: Getty Images)\nScientists have found that how rain falls day to day throughout the year is nearly as important to the world\u2019s vegetation as how much. Reporting Dec. 11 in Nature, the researchers showed that even in years with similar rainfall totals, plants fared differently when that water came in fewer, bigger bursts.\nOverall, in years with less frequent but more concentrated rainfall, plants in drier environments like the U.S. Southwest were more likely to thrive. In humid ecosystems like the Central American rainforest, vegetation tended to fare worse, possibly because it was not adapted to the longer dry spells.\nScientists have previously estimated that almost half of the world\u2019s vegetation is driven primarily by how much rain falls in a year. Less well understood is the role of day-to-day variability, said lead author Andrew Feldman, a hydrologist and ecosystem scientist at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.\nGlobal warming is driving shifts in precipitation patterns that are producing stronger rainstorms \u2013 with longer dry spells in between \u2013 compared to a century ago. \u201cThat aspect of expected changes to future rainfall patterns is relatively well understood,\u201d said study co-author Alexandra Konings, associate professor of Earth system science at the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability. \u201cSo this new finding points to an area where further study might lead to significant improvements in our overall ability to predict future vegetation change.\u201d\nConsider how a houseplant might respond if you give it a pitcher of water each week \u2013 either portioned out every couple days, or dumped on the plant all at once, Feldman suggested. Scale that to the size of the Corn Belt or a rainforest and the answer could have implications for crop yields and ultimately how much carbon dioxide plants remove from the atmosphere.\nThe team, including researchers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and multiple universities, analyzed two decades of field and satellite observations, canvassing millions of square miles. Their study area encompassed diverse landscapes from Siberia in the north to the southern tip of Patagonia.\nThey found that plants across 42% of Earth\u2019s vegetated land surface were sensitive to daily rainfall variability. Of those, a little over half fared better in years with fewer but more intense wet days. These include croplands as well as drier landscapes like grasslands and deserts, which more commonly showed increased growth. In contrast, broadleaf forests, which have trees such as oak, maple, and beech \u2013 and rainforests in lower and mid-latitudes tended to fare worse under those conditions. The effect was especially pronounced in Southeast Asian rainforests across the Pacific Islands.\nOn average, daily rainfall variability was nearly as important as annual rainfall totals in driving growth worldwide. That level of importance is several times higher than previous estimates; the scientists attribute the new finding to a longer data record.\nThe new study relied primarily on a suite of NASA missions and datasets, including the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) algorithm, which provides rain and snowfall rates for most of the planet every 30 minutes using a network of international satellites.\nTo gauge plant response day to day, the researchers calculated how green an area appeared in satellite imagery. \u201cGreenness\u201d is commonly used to estimate vegetation density and health. They also tracked a faint reddish light that plants emit when they feed. During photosynthesis, when a plant absorbs sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into food, its chlorophyll \u201cleaks\u201d unused photons. This faint light is called solar-induced fluorescence, and it\u2019s a telltale sign of flourishing vegetation.\nInvisible to the naked eye, plant fluorescence can be detected by instruments aboard satellites such as NASA\u2019s Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2, or OCO-2. Launched in 2014, OCO-2 has observed the U.S. Midwest appearing to glow during the growing season.\nAs rising temperatures continue to alter weather patterns, Feldman said the findings highlight the vital role that plants play in moving carbon atoms around Earth \u2013 a process called the carbon cycle. Vegetation, including farmlands, forms a vast carbon sink, absorbing excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\nA finer understanding of how plants thrive or decline day to day, storm by storm, could help us better understand their role in that critical cycle, Feldman said.\nThis story was adapted from a press release originally published by NASA.\nAdditional co-authors are affiliated with Columbia University, Indiana University, University of Arizona, and NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.The research was supported by NASA, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, the U.S. National Science Foundation, and the Swiss National Science Foundation.\nBased on new analyses of satellite data, scientists have found that hydrologic conditions that increase flash drought risk occur more often than current models predict. The research also shows that incorporating how plants change soil structures can improve Earth system models.\nIn a 34-year global analysis, researchers found that photosynthesis \u2013 an important process for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it in soil \u2013 was controlled by extreme wet events nearly as often as droughts in certain locations.\nNew research suggests dry air combined with warmer temperatures may prompt bigger than expected changes in how water moves through plants.

This is referred to by the CAT as the 1.5\u00b0C Paris Agreement goal.\nThis goal is linked to a requirement in the Paris Agreement1 that all countries work together to bring greenhouse gas emissions to zero within the second half of the 21st century, with the timing of when the zero emissions are reached being determined by the best available science in relation to the achievement of the long-term temperature goal. The long-term temperature goal in the Paris Agreement goes significantly further, both legally and substantively, than the earlier goal to hold warming to below 2\u00b0C (Schleussner et al. 2016).\nThe Copenhagen Accord from 2009 mentions the long-term temperature goal of holding the global temperature increase to \u201cbelow 2 degrees Celsius\u201d (UNFCCC 2010). One year later, Parties to the UNFCCC adopted the Cancun Agreements which \u201cfurther recognised that deep cuts in global GHG emissions are required, with a view to hold the increase in global average temperature below 2\u00b0C above preindustrial levels\u201d. This is referred to by the CAT as the Cancun 2\u00b0C goal.\nThe 1.5\u00b0C Paris Agreement goal is, by design, a strengthening of the Cancun 2\u00b0C goal.\nThe origin of the 1.5\u00b0C Paris Agreement limit derived from the concern amongst the vulnerable countries about the adverse consequences of a 2\u00b0C warming level. In 2014 the UNFCCC established a process to review whether the long-term Cancun goal of holding warming below 2\u00b0C was adequate to avoid dangerous climate change and to consider \u201cstrengthening the long-term global goal on the basis of the best available scientific knowledge, including in relation to a global average temperature rise of 1.5\u00b0C\u201d 2. This process ended in 2015 with the final report of its scientific arm (Structured Expert Dialogue) concluding that using the globally-agreed warming limit of 2\u00b0C as a \u201cguardrail\u201d is not safe, and that governments should aim for 1.5\u00b0C instead3. The 2\u00b0C limit was found not to be in line with the ultimate objective of the Convention to \u201cprevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.\u201d This was a key input into the Paris Agreement negotiations then underway and led ultimately to the Paris Agreement\u2019s long-term temperature goal in Article 2.1 as described above.\nOne of the key architectural concepts of the Cancun 2\u00b0C goal that carried over into the Paris agreement long-term temperature goal is that of \"holding warming\" below a certain level. The \u201chold below\u201d formulation is clearly stronger than a returning to a certain level of warming by a certain time (up to 2100 (from an implicitly higher-level). In the negotiations of this warming goal, formulations such as returning to 2\u00b0C by 2100 were proposed and rejected. In examining any set of emission pathways consistent with a long-term temperature goal, a requirement to hold below a certain level of warming requires greater and faster would emission reductions than a temperature goal that requires returning to a certain degree of warming by, for example, 2100. This has concrete implications for policy \u2013 and emission pathways - and as a consequence the Climate Action Tracker has been careful to use pathways that are fully consistent with the goals.\nThe probability of achieving a given temperature target has also been a discussion point, but not as explicitly as concepts such as holding warming below a certain level or return warming to a certain level by a certain time. In general, it is fairly well accepted that pathways that assess specific warming goals should meet those goals with a likely or greater probability. Few would argue that a specific warming goal should be met with only a 50% chance (toss of a coin).\nOver the years, there has been a strong consensus within the scientific community in interpreting the Cancun goal of holding warming below 2\u00b0C to use the \u201clikely below\u201d 2\u00b0C class of scenarios in the scientific literature. These energy-economic model scenarios have a 66% chance, or greater, of staying below a 2\u00b0C global mean warming above pre-industrial levels throughout the 21st century.\nThe Climate Action Tracker has used these pathways as benchmark for emissions reductions in line with Cancun 2\u00b0C goal, as well as a basis for assessing the adequacy of efforts of individual countries.\nFrom its inception in 2009 the Climate Action Tracker itself has consistently referred to the 1.5\u00b0C global mean warming limit in its analyses, alongside the 2\u00b0C pathway, particularly in relation to comparing the global effect of pledges and commitments with emission pathways for both these warming limits.\nAs noted, above the Paris Agreement 1.5\u00b0C goal, by design, goes beyond the Cancun Agreements\u2019 below 2\u00b0C limit and aims to hold warming to well below 2\u00b0C and to pursue efforts to limit temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C.\nThe most comprehensive and up-to-date assessment of Paris Agreement compatible mitigation pathways is the recent IPCC Special Report on 1.5\u00b0C (SR1.5). Its Summary for Policy Makers (SPM) (IPCC, 2018) established 1.5\u00b0C compatible mitigation pathways as being pathways with no- or limited-overshoot. These pathways limit median global warming to 1.5\u00b0C throughout the 21st century without exceeding that level (\u201cno-overshoot\u201d), or allow warming to drop below 1.5\u00b0C by the end of the century (around 1.3\u00b0C warming by 2100) after a brief and limited overshoot of median peak warming below 1.6\u00b0C around the 2060s (\u201clow-overshoot\u201d). With a peak warming of (at most) 1.6oC these pathways meet several tests with reference to the Paris Agreement LTTG.\nThe \u201chold below 2\u00b0C\u201d pathways hold warming below 2\u00b0C with a least 66% probability and have peak 21st century warming of up to 1.8\u00b0C, whereas 1.5\u00b0C compatible mitigation pathways in IPCC SR1.5 peak warming a\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Climate change exacerbates droughts by making them more frequent, longer, and more severe. The USGS works with state and federal partners to study, monitor, and help mitigate drought impacts across the U.S. now and into the future.\nCheck out the USGS Drought Website to see up-to-date news, science, and publications on drought and water supply.\nThe USGS Water Science School teaches people of all ages about water! Check out some of their pages related to drought, groundwater, and water management to understand the effects of climate-induced droughts on human communities.\nDefining drought may seem easy. If an area receives less rain or snow than expected over the course of a year, it can be classified as being in drought. The severity of drought increases over time depending on how long an area remains arid. However, there\u2019s more to the story than solely if there isn\u2019t enough rain or snow.\nDroughts don\u2019t just affect water stored in wetlands, lakes, and rivers, but also water below ground stored in aquifers and in the soil. When this groundwater gets used up, the dry ground can act like a sponge, sucking surface water straight in. The surface water-groundwater relationship gets even more complicated with snowpack. If snow melts too early in the year, water can move through the environment too quickly, causing the ground to dry up and become \u201cthirsty\u201d too soon. So even if there is \u201cenough\u201d water, the timing of the water may dictate whether an area is in a drought.\nClimate change has further altered the natural pattern of droughts, making them more frequent, longer, and more severe. Since 2000, the western United States is experiencing some of the driest conditions on record. The southwestern U.S., in particular, is going through an unprecedented period of extreme drought. This will have lasting impacts on the environment and those who rely on it.\nThe USGS employs its wide range of scientific expertise to study how droughts affect human and natural communities and how to effectively predict, prepare for, manage, and recover from water shortages. USGS research spans geographic and temporal scales, exploring everything from short, local \u201cflash\u201d droughts to long-term, large-scale \u201cmega\u201d droughts.\nOur science helps to:\nThe USGS actively coordinates our drought research efforts among our many diverse scientists. Experts like water scientists, wildlife biologists, and geologists all work together to study droughts and their impacts. This effort strengthens our existing observation networks by investing in real-time data collection on rainfall, stream flows, and environmental impacts. With these improved data sets, USGS scientists are working to better understand when and how droughts occur. We are also developing models to help predict which communities and landscapes may be vulnerable to future droughts, as well as when, how long, and how severe those droughts might be. We provide this information to help cities and natural resource managers develop plans to prepare for future droughts and lessen the impacts of droughts on natural and human communities.\nUSGS Headquarters 12201 Sunrise Valley Drive Reston, VA 20192 United States\n12201 Sunrise Valley Drive MS 516 Reston, VA 20192 United States\nDo Droughts Affect Groundwater Quality?

It is an issue that requires international cooperation and coordinated solutions at all levels.\nTo tackle climate change and its negative impacts, world leaders at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris reached a breakthrough on 12 December 2015: the historic Paris Agreement.\nThe Agreement sets long-term goals to guide all nations to:\nThe Agreement is a legally binding international treaty. It entered into force on 4 November 2016. Today, 195 Parties (194 States plus the European Union) have joined the Paris Agreement.\nThe Agreement includes commitments from all countries to reduce their emissions and work together to adapt to the impacts of climate change, and calls on countries to strengthen their commitments over time. The Agreement provides a pathway for developed nations to assist developing nations in their climate mitigation and adaptation efforts while creating a framework for the transparent monitoring and reporting of countries\u2019 climate goals.\nThe Paris Agreement provides a durable framework guiding the global effort for decades to come. It marks the beginning of a shift towards a net-zero emissions world. Implementation of the Agreement is also essential for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.\nThe Paris Agreement works on a five- year cycle of increasingly ambitious climate action carried out by countries. Every five years, each country is expected to submit an updated national climate action plan - known as Nationally Determined Contribution, or NDC.\nIn their NDCs, countries communicate actions they will take to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in order to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement. Countries also communicate in the NDCs actions they will take to build resilience to adapt to the impacts of rising temperatures. In 2023, the first \u201cglobal stocktake\u201d of the world\u2019s efforts under the Paris Agreement concluded at COP28 with a decision on how to accelerate action across all areas \u2013 mitigation, adaptation, and finance \u2013 by 2030, including a call on governments to speed up the transition away from fossil fuels to renewable energy such as wind and solar power in their next round of climate commitments.\nTo better frame the efforts towards the long-term goal, the Paris Agreement invites countries to formulate and submit long-term strategies. Unlike NDCs, they are not mandatory.\nThe operational details for the practical implementation of the Paris Agreement were agreed on at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP24) in Katowice, Poland, in December 2018, in what is colloquially called the Paris Rulebook, and finalized at COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, in November 2021.\nMore information on the Paris Agreement can be found here.\nWhat is net zero?

This is referred to by the CAT as the 1.5\u00b0C Paris Agreement goal.\nThis goal is linked to a requirement in the Paris Agreement1 that all countries work together to bring greenhouse gas emissions to zero within the second half of the 21st century, with the timing of when the zero emissions are reached being determined by the best available science in relation to the achievement of the long-term temperature goal. The long-term temperature goal in the Paris Agreement goes significantly further, both legally and substantively, than the earlier goal to hold warming to below 2\u00b0C (Schleussner et al. 2016).\nThe Copenhagen Accord from 2009 mentions the long-term temperature goal of holding the global temperature increase to \u201cbelow 2 degrees Celsius\u201d (UNFCCC 2010). One year later, Parties to the UNFCCC adopted the Cancun Agreements which \u201cfurther recognised that deep cuts in global GHG emissions are required, with a view to hold the increase in global average temperature below 2\u00b0C above preindustrial levels\u201d. This is referred to by the CAT as the Cancun 2\u00b0C goal.\nThe 1.5\u00b0C Paris Agreement goal is, by design, a strengthening of the Cancun 2\u00b0C goal.\nThe origin of the 1.5\u00b0C Paris Agreement limit derived from the concern amongst the vulnerable countries about the adverse consequences of a 2\u00b0C warming level. In 2014 the UNFCCC established a process to review whether the long-term Cancun goal of holding warming below 2\u00b0C was adequate to avoid dangerous climate change and to consider \u201cstrengthening the long-term global goal on the basis of the best available scientific knowledge, including in relation to a global average temperature rise of 1.5\u00b0C\u201d 2. This process ended in 2015 with the final report of its scientific arm (Structured Expert Dialogue) concluding that using the globally-agreed warming limit of 2\u00b0C as a \u201cguardrail\u201d is not safe, and that governments should aim for 1.5\u00b0C instead3. The 2\u00b0C limit was found not to be in line with the ultimate objective of the Convention to \u201cprevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.\u201d This was a key input into the Paris Agreement negotiations then underway and led ultimately to the Paris Agreement\u2019s long-term temperature goal in Article 2.1 as described above.\nOne of the key architectural concepts of the Cancun 2\u00b0C goal that carried over into the Paris agreement long-term temperature goal is that of \"holding warming\" below a certain level. The \u201chold below\u201d formulation is clearly stronger than a returning to a certain level of warming by a certain time (up to 2100 (from an implicitly higher-level). In the negotiations of this warming goal, formulations such as returning to 2\u00b0C by 2100 were proposed and rejected. In examining any set of emission pathways consistent with a long-term temperature goal, a requirement to hold below a certain level of warming requires greater and faster would emission reductions than a temperature goal that requires returning to a certain degree of warming by, for example, 2100. This has concrete implications for policy \u2013 and emission pathways - and as a consequence the Climate Action Tracker has been careful to use pathways that are fully consistent with the goals.\nThe probability of achieving a given temperature target has also been a discussion point, but not as explicitly as concepts such as holding warming below a certain level or return warming to a certain level by a certain time. In general, it is fairly well accepted that pathways that assess specific warming goals should meet those goals with a likely or greater probability. Few would argue that a specific warming goal should be met with only a 50% chance (toss of a coin).\nOver the years, there has been a strong consensus within the scientific community in interpreting the Cancun goal of holding warming below 2\u00b0C to use the \u201clikely below\u201d 2\u00b0C class of scenarios in the scientific literature. These energy-economic model scenarios have a 66% chance, or greater, of staying below a 2\u00b0C global mean warming above pre-industrial levels throughout the 21st century.\nThe Climate Action Tracker has used these pathways as benchmark for emissions reductions in line with Cancun 2\u00b0C goal, as well as a basis for assessing the adequacy of efforts of individual countries.\nFrom its inception in 2009 the Climate Action Tracker itself has consistently referred to the 1.5\u00b0C global mean warming limit in its analyses, alongside the 2\u00b0C pathway, particularly in relation to comparing the global effect of pledges and commitments with emission pathways for both these warming limits.\nAs noted, above the Paris Agreement 1.5\u00b0C goal, by design, goes beyond the Cancun Agreements\u2019 below 2\u00b0C limit and aims to hold warming to well below 2\u00b0C and to pursue efforts to limit temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C.\nThe most comprehensive and up-to-date assessment of Paris Agreement compatible mitigation pathways is the recent IPCC Special Report on 1.5\u00b0C (SR1.5). Its Summary for Policy Makers (SPM) (IPCC, 2018) established 1.5\u00b0C compatible mitigation pathways as being pathways with no- or limited-overshoot. These pathways limit median global warming to 1.5\u00b0C throughout the 21st century without exceeding that level (\u201cno-overshoot\u201d), or allow warming to drop below 1.5\u00b0C by the end of the century (around 1.3\u00b0C warming by 2100) after a brief and limited overshoot of median peak warming below 1.6\u00b0C around the 2060s (\u201clow-overshoot\u201d). With a peak warming of (at most) 1.6oC these pathways meet several tests with reference to the Paris Agreement LTTG.\nThe \u201chold below 2\u00b0C\u201d pathways hold warming below 2\u00b0C with a least 66% probability and have peak 21st century warming of up to 1.8\u00b0C, whereas 1.5\u00b0C compatible mitigation pathways in IPCC SR1.5 peak warming a\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Because of the West\u2019s largely semi-arid and desert climates, droughts are natural occurrences across the region. However, regional climate isn\u2019t the only culprit in drought activity. Climate change, namely rising average temperatures driven by human-generated emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases, is contributing to droughts, too.\nGlobal warming increases the risk of drought in several ways.\nFor one, water generally evaporates more quickly at higher temperatures. For that reason, hotter weather can result in drier soils. As high air temperatures sap liquid water from soils and plant leaves, transforming it into atmospheric water vapor via a process called transpiration, ground-level drying will increase in some regions. (Ironically, this additional atmospheric moisture triggers heavier downpours in other regions, which explains why the overall trend in the U.S. has been toward wetter conditions.)\nHigher air temperatures not only encourage drought conditions to build but also intensify them. What might have otherwise been a mild or moderate drought in a cooler world will become, in a warmer world, more severe as a result of increased evaporation.\nWarming also diminishes snowfall, an essential water resource for the estimated 1.9 billion residents of the Northern Hemisphere who depend on snowpacks, or snow reservoirs that store water during the cooler months and release it when it\u2019s needed in the warmer, drier months. Rising temperatures increase the fraction of winter precipitation that falls as rain rather than snow and also shorten the cold season, so there\u2019s less time for snow to even occur. Such was the case in 2015, the fourth-warmest year in the contiguous U.S., when a snow drought reduced the April snowpack in the Sierra Nevada mountain range to a mere 5% of its historical average water content \u2014 its lowest snowpack in 500 years.\nSeasonal melting of snowpacks can be thrown off-kilter, too. As average temperatures warm above freezing earlier in the spring, snowmelt occurs sooner and faster than usual. And rapid melting results in a shorter period during which soils and plants are kept moist.\nAnother way a warmer atmosphere can disrupt precipitation is by shifting storm tracks. Ordinarily, low-pressure systems known as extratropical cyclones form between 30 and 60 degrees latitude north and south of the equator. But as the climate warms globally, storms are shifting toward the poles. This means that weather features such as atmospheric rivers, which supply as much as 50% of annual precipitation to states in the Western U.S., could cease to pass over regions where their moisture is much-needed.\nScientists see a clear correlation between droughts and global warming. But a correlation between two events doesn\u2019t always mean one caused the other. For example, ice cream sales often increase around the time that baseball game attendance rises, but that does not mean that eating ice cream causes people to attend baseball games. Nor does it mean that attending baseball games causes people to eat ice cream.\nIt can be tricky to attribute an increase in droughts to global warming because droughts are variable. In other words, they can occur every year or every few years, last for years or decades, and cause varying levels of dryness. That makes it difficult to distinguish random events from those possibly shaped by human-caused warming. However, the more drought dovetails with trends of increasing temperature, decreasing precipitation, and with computer model projections, the more confident scientists are in pointing to climate change.\nIn a 2020 study in the journal Science, for example, researchers observed how human-caused climate change is contributing to the 21st-century megadrought in the Western U.S. and northern Mexico by evaluating trends in modeled temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation data between 1901 and 2018. According to the study\u2019s findings, human-caused warming accounts for 46% of this drought\u2019s severity.\nWhat about the rest of the world? Scientists have been cautious about linking human activities to global drought patterns, largely because drought hasn\u2019t occurred as uniformly worldwide as it has across individual regions. That said, building evidence supports the climate change-drought connection on a global scale.\nAccording to an August 2021 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, scientists have high confidence that for every half degree Celsius (0.9 degree Fahrenheit) the atmosphere warms, noticeable increases will occur in some regions in the intensity and frequency of droughts that harm agriculture and ecosystems. Similarly, the report notes that extreme agricultural and ecological drought events that used to occur once every 10 years are now 1.7 times more likely than they were from 1850 to 1900, before humans heavily influenced the climate.\nWhile the intricacies of the climate change-drought connection are still being uncovered, scientists tend to agree on one thing: Droughts will likely become more intense into the 2050s and beyond.

From record-breaking warmth and prolonged dry spells to back-to-back heatwaves, the UK\u2019s weather has been making headlines and prompting some to ask, is this \u2018just summer\u2019?\nYesterday, further drought declarations were issued across parts of the UK, following what has been the driest January to June for England since 1976. This past weekend saw the third official heatwave of the summer, and temperatures are set to rise again at the end of this week.\nSpring 2025 was exceptional, going down as the UK\u2019s warmest and sunniest on record. June followed suit, becoming the warmest June ever recorded in England, and the second warmest for the UK in records since 1884.\nProvisional Met Office data up until (and including) 15 July shows that the UK\u2019s average mean temperature so far this summer sits 1.14\u00b0C above the long-term meteorological average for summer. England in particular has been well above average (1.58\u00b0C), whilst Scotland and Northern Ireland have remained closer to their seasonal averages.\nDaily minimum temperatures (the lowest temperature recorded during the 24-hour period from 09:00-09:00) are currently tracking well above average (0.78\u00b0C) for this point in the summer. The graph below, based on data from 1931, illustrates this.\nDaily maximum temperatures (the highest temperature recorded during the 24-hour period from 09:00-09:00) are also tracking above average \u2013 1.53\u00b0C as of the 15 July. England has seen especially high maximum temperatures, up 2.14\u00b0C on its summer average.\nThe graph below illustrates how daily maximum temperatures have been well above average across southern England since the start of spring. This has been in part, due to the three official heatwaves we have already seen this summer which can be seen on this chart.\nSo far, there have been 11 days in 2025 where temperatures have reached 30\u00b0C or higher. Based on station observations from 1931, this has only happened twice before up to this point in the summer - in 1976 and 2018.\nThe highest temperature of the year so far, 35.8\u00b0C, was reached on 1 July at Faversham in Kent. This remains below the UK\u2019s all-time high of 40.3\u00b0C, recorded in Coningsby, Lincolnshire, in July 2022. Temperatures reaching the low to mid 30s is becoming increasingly frequent as our climate continues to warm.\nRead: The UK's longest heatwave events and where they happened\nAs the climate continues to change, the UK is likely to see more frequent and intense heatwaves. A new Met Office study released in June highlights how UK heatwaves could become longer and hotter due to escalating climate trends, with an estimated 50-50 chance of seeing 40\u00b0C again in the UK in the next 12 years.\nThe UK continues to experience a significant marine heatwave at the moment, with the intensification linked with the land heatwave that we experienced last week. Marine heatwave conditions are likely to ease a little southwest of the UK in the coming days, as westerly winds strengthen. Sea temperatures will continue to increase in the central and northern North Sea however. The map below shows conditions around the UK on 14 July 2025.\nAll four UK nations have recorded above average sunshine so far this summer, with Northern Ireland seeing the least. This continues the theme from spring, which was also exceptionally sunny.\nFollowing an extremely dry spring, summer rainfall has remained just below average across the UK, with 45% of the whole summer\u2019s long-term average recorded.\nHowever, regional variation is significant. Large areas of eastern Wales and England have received less than 30% of their average summer rainfall whereas in contrast, parts of Cumbria have already received close to their full summer average, and we\u2019re only halfway through the season.\nEngland has been the driest of the four UK nations, recording just 37% of its average rainfall for the whole of summer. There\u2019s also a clear contrast between north and south, with southern England seeing 29% compared to northern England at 49%. Of particular note is the fact that the rainfall deficits that have built up through the spring have persisted and increased further in summer so far.\nThis is illustrated by the below graph, which shows how the rainfall deficit has built up across southern England so far this year.\nMet Office scientist Emily Carlisle explains: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say this summer has been typical so far when we look at the statistics. June was the warmest on record for England, with our records going back to 1884. That warmth has continued into July, with three heatwaves so far this summer and temperatures rising again later this week. There is of course, still a month-and-a-half of meteorological summer to go, so plenty of time for things to change.\u201d\nSeveral factors have contributed to the unusual warmth:\nPersistent high pressure: A dominant high-pressure system has been sitting over the UK, squashing the air and causing sinking air that suppresses cloud formation. This results in clear skies and strong sunshine, which heat the ground. With little wind and continued sunshine each day, temperatures build up over time.\nDry ground: The extremely dry spring has left soils parched. With less moisture available for evaporation, more solar energy goes directly into heating the air.\nMarine heatwave: Sea surface temperatures around the UK are currently well above average. As air passes over these warmer waters, it retains more heat.\nClimate change: The UK is warming. The newly released State of the UK Climate Report 2024 shows the UK is warming at a rate of approximately 0.25\u00b0C per decade. 2023, 2022 and 2018 are among the UK\u2019s top-ten warmest summers in records back to 1884.\nLooking ahead, the latter part of July and early August are expected to bring more typical British summer weather - changeable conditions with a mix of rain and sunshine.

Building drought resilience for water utilities means increasing their ability to respond to water supply threats, withstand impacts from drought, and quickly recover when drought does occur.\nThis map shows current streamflow conditions at U.S. Geological Survey streamgages, compared to historical conditions for the same day of the year. Click on a streamgage to view more information.\nOperational Impacts\nDrought impacts on water utility operations range from loss of water supply to increased costs and reduced revenues.\nIncreasing Demand\nHigher temperatures result in increased water demand for both agricultural irrigation and drinking water supply.\nAquifer Depletion\nLimited surface water storage, among other factors, has contributed to significant depletion of aquifers in many U.S. regions.\nThe water sector is central to public health and the economy. Water utilities ensure a reliable supply of clean water to communities and ecosystems and contribute significantly to the resilience of many other sectors, including agriculture, energy, and manufacturing.\nDrought can result in impacts to water utility operations, including:\nIn dry years, many areas increase their reliance on groundwater. Groundwater provides more than 40 percent of the water used for U.S. agriculture and domestic water supplies. Increased pumping during droughts can reduce the future availability of those supplies, but strategies to replenish depleted underground aquifers can be helpful towards building drought resilience.\nThe water utility sector works to respond to water supply threats, withstand impacts from drought, and quickly recover when drought does occur. Drought and water shortage planning is not just a best management practice for water suppliers; it is a requirement in a growing number of states and water management districts. A water shortage plan enables a water supplier to assess the risks and reduce the vulnerability of a community to water shortage impacts, and to establish priorities that will provide water for public health and safety and minimize impacts on economic activity and environmental resources. Long-term drought resilience strategies should also consider projected climate conditions and incorporate planning to estimate demand and identify supply solutions well into the future.\nTo help the water utility sector build drought resilience, and even reduce risks from flooding, NIDIS is supporting research into Forecast-Informed Reservoir Operations(link is external) (FIRO). FIRO is a reservoir-operations strategy that uses enhanced monitoring and improved weather and water forecasts to inform decision making in selectively retaining or releasing water from reservoirs to optimize water supply reliability and reduce flood risk. FIRO is being developed and tested on Lake Mendocino in California as a collaborative effort among multiple agencies and organizations. NIDIS is also working with researchers, NOAA forecasters, and water utilities to learn what steps are needed to integrate NOAA forecasts in reservoir operations and water resources management in the Southern Great Plains (Texas and Oklahoma).\nDrought can imperil both the quantity and quality of the water supplied by utilities to the public. Therefore, early warning systems are vital for the water utility sector in strengthening its resilience to drought. The resources below are organized by the key components of a drought early warning system: (1) drought observation and monitoring; (2) drought planning and preparedness; (3) prediction and forecasting of drought; (4) communication and outreach to the public and affected sectors; and (5) interdisciplinary and applied research on topics of concern to drought-affected sectors.\nIdentify and access datasets and maps for monitoring water supply.\nA collection of tools for accessing observed and forecasted snow data.\nSTAY CONNECTED\nSubscribe to NIDIS emails for the latest regional drought updates, webinars, and news.

(Image credit: Getty Images)\nScientists have found that how rain falls day to day throughout the year is nearly as important to the world\u2019s vegetation as how much. Reporting Dec. 11 in Nature, the researchers showed that even in years with similar rainfall totals, plants fared differently when that water came in fewer, bigger bursts.\nOverall, in years with less frequent but more concentrated rainfall, plants in drier environments like the U.S. Southwest were more likely to thrive. In humid ecosystems like the Central American rainforest, vegetation tended to fare worse, possibly because it was not adapted to the longer dry spells.\nScientists have previously estimated that almost half of the world\u2019s vegetation is driven primarily by how much rain falls in a year. Less well understood is the role of day-to-day variability, said lead author Andrew Feldman, a hydrologist and ecosystem scientist at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.\nGlobal warming is driving shifts in precipitation patterns that are producing stronger rainstorms \u2013 with longer dry spells in between \u2013 compared to a century ago. \u201cThat aspect of expected changes to future rainfall patterns is relatively well understood,\u201d said study co-author Alexandra Konings, associate professor of Earth system science at the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability. \u201cSo this new finding points to an area where further study might lead to significant improvements in our overall ability to predict future vegetation change.\u201d\nConsider how a houseplant might respond if you give it a pitcher of water each week \u2013 either portioned out every couple days, or dumped on the plant all at once, Feldman suggested. Scale that to the size of the Corn Belt or a rainforest and the answer could have implications for crop yields and ultimately how much carbon dioxide plants remove from the atmosphere.\nThe team, including researchers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and multiple universities, analyzed two decades of field and satellite observations, canvassing millions of square miles. Their study area encompassed diverse landscapes from Siberia in the north to the southern tip of Patagonia.\nThey found that plants across 42% of Earth\u2019s vegetated land surface were sensitive to daily rainfall variability. Of those, a little over half fared better in years with fewer but more intense wet days. These include croplands as well as drier landscapes like grasslands and deserts, which more commonly showed increased growth. In contrast, broadleaf forests, which have trees such as oak, maple, and beech \u2013 and rainforests in lower and mid-latitudes tended to fare worse under those conditions. The effect was especially pronounced in Southeast Asian rainforests across the Pacific Islands.\nOn average, daily rainfall variability was nearly as important as annual rainfall totals in driving growth worldwide. That level of importance is several times higher than previous estimates; the scientists attribute the new finding to a longer data record.\nThe new study relied primarily on a suite of NASA missions and datasets, including the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) algorithm, which provides rain and snowfall rates for most of the planet every 30 minutes using a network of international satellites.\nTo gauge plant response day to day, the researchers calculated how green an area appeared in satellite imagery. \u201cGreenness\u201d is commonly used to estimate vegetation density and health. They also tracked a faint reddish light that plants emit when they feed. During photosynthesis, when a plant absorbs sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into food, its chlorophyll \u201cleaks\u201d unused photons. This faint light is called solar-induced fluorescence, and it\u2019s a telltale sign of flourishing vegetation.\nInvisible to the naked eye, plant fluorescence can be detected by instruments aboard satellites such as NASA\u2019s Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2, or OCO-2. Launched in 2014, OCO-2 has observed the U.S. Midwest appearing to glow during the growing season.\nAs rising temperatures continue to alter weather patterns, Feldman said the findings highlight the vital role that plants play in moving carbon atoms around Earth \u2013 a process called the carbon cycle. Vegetation, including farmlands, forms a vast carbon sink, absorbing excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\nA finer understanding of how plants thrive or decline day to day, storm by storm, could help us better understand their role in that critical cycle, Feldman said.\nThis story was adapted from a press release originally published by NASA.\nAdditional co-authors are affiliated with Columbia University, Indiana University, University of Arizona, and NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.The research was supported by NASA, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, the U.S. National Science Foundation, and the Swiss National Science Foundation.\nBased on new analyses of satellite data, scientists have found that hydrologic conditions that increase flash drought risk occur more often than current models predict. The research also shows that incorporating how plants change soil structures can improve Earth system models.\nIn a 34-year global analysis, researchers found that photosynthesis \u2013 an important process for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it in soil \u2013 was controlled by extreme wet events nearly as often as droughts in certain locations.\nNew research suggests dry air combined with warmer temperatures may prompt bigger than expected changes in how water moves through plants.

A new Met Office study released in June ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAuthor: Press Office\n16 July 2025\nAs we reach the midpoint of meteorological summer, it\u2019s clear this year has been far from ordinary. From record-breaking warmth and prolonged dry spells to back-to-back heatwaves, the UK\u2019s weather has been making headlines and prompting some to ask, is this \u2018just summer\u2019?\nYesterday, further drought declarations were issued across parts of the UK, following what has been the driest January to June for England since 1976. This past weekend saw the third official heatwave of the summer, and temperatures are set to rise again at the end of this week.\nSpring 2025 was exceptional, going down as the UK\u2019s warmest and sunniest on record. June followed suit, becoming the warmest June ever recorded in England, and the second warmest for the UK in records since 1884.\nProvisional Met Office data up until (and including) 15 July shows that the UK\u2019s average mean temperature so far this summer sits 1.14\u00b0C above the long-term meteorological average for summer. England in particular has been well above average (1.58\u00b0C), whilst Scotland and Northern Ireland have remained closer to their seasonal averages.\nDaily minimum temperatures (the lowest temperature recorded during the 24-hour period from 09:00-09:00) are currently tracking well above average (0.78\u00b0C) for this point in the summer. The graph below, based on data from 1931, illustrates this.\nDaily maximum temperatures (the highest temperature recorded during the 24-hour period from 09:00-09:00) are also tracking above average \u2013 1.53\u00b0C as of the 15 July. England has seen especially high maximum temperatures, up 2.14\u00b0C on its summer average.\nThe graph below illustrates how daily maximum temperatures have been well above average across southern England since the start of spring. This has been in part, due to the three official heatwaves we have already seen this summer which can be seen on this chart.\nSo far, there have been 11 days in 2025 where temperatures have reached 30\u00b0C or higher. Based on station observations from 1931, this has only happened twice before up to this point in the summer - in 1976 and 2018.\nThe highest temperature of the year so far, 35.8\u00b0C, was reached on 1 July at Faversham in Kent. This remains below the UK\u2019s all-time high of 40.3\u00b0C, recorded in Coningsby, Lincolnshire, in July 2022. Temperatures reaching the low to mid 30s is becoming increasingly frequent as our climate continues to warm.\nRead: The UK's longest heatwave events and where they happened\nAs the climate continues to change, the UK is likely to see more frequent and intense heatwaves. A new Met Office study released in June highlights how UK heatwaves could become longer and hotter due to escalating climate trends, with an estimated 50-50 chance of seeing 40\u00b0C again in the UK in the next 12 years.\nThe UK continues to experience a significant marine heatwave at the moment, with the intensification linked with the land heatwave that we experienced last week. Marine heatwave conditions are likely to ease a little southwest of the UK in the coming days, as westerly winds strengthen. Sea temperatures will continue to increase in the central and northern North Sea however. The map below shows conditions around the UK on 14 July 2025.\nAll four UK nations have recorded above average sunshine so far this summer, with Northern Ireland seeing the least. This continues the theme from spring, which was also exceptionally sunny.\nFollowing an extremely dry spring, summer rainfall has remained just below average across the UK, with 45% of the whole summer\u2019s long-term average recorded.\nHowever, regional variation is significant. Large areas of eastern Wales and England have received less than 30% of their average summer rainfall whereas in contrast, parts of Cumbria have already received close to their full summer average, and we\u2019re only halfway through the season.\nEngland has been the driest of the four UK nations, recording just 37% of its average rainfall for the whole of summer. There\u2019s also a clear contrast between north and south, with southern England seeing 29% compared to northern England at 49%. Of particular note is the fact that the rainfall deficits that have built up through the spring have persisted and increased further in summer so far.\nThis is illustrated by the below graph, which shows how the rainfall deficit has built up across southern England so far this year.\nMet Office scientist Emily Carlisle explains: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say this summer has been typical so far when we look at the statistics. June was the warmest on record for England, with our records going back to 1884. That warmth has continued into July, with three heatwaves so far this summer and temperatures rising again later this week. There is of course, still a month-and-a-half of meteorological summer to go, so plenty of time for things to change.\u201d\nSeveral factors have contributed to the unusual warmth:\nPersistent high pressure: A dominant high-pressure system has been sitting over the UK, squashing the air and causing sinking air that suppresses cloud formation. This results in clear skies and strong sunshine, which heat the ground. With little wind and continued sunshine each day, temperatures build up over time.\nDry ground: The extremely dry spring has left soils parched. With less moisture available for evaporation, more solar energy goes directly into heating the air.\nMarine heatwave: Sea surface temperatures around the UK are currently well above average. As air passes over these warmer waters, it retains more heat.\nClimate change: The UK is warming. The newly released State of the UK Climate Report 2024 shows the UK is warming at a rate of approximately 0.25\u00b0C per decade. 2023, 2022 and 2018 are among the UK\u2019s top-ten warmest summers in records back to 1884.\nLooking ahead, the latter part of July and early August are expected to bring more typical British summer weather - changeable conditions with a mix of rain and sunshine. While confidence in long-range foreca\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This review summarizes literature on potential impacts of climate change on waterborne diseases, organized around a framework of questions that can be addressed depending on available data.\nA growing body of evidence suggests that climate change may alter the incidence of waterborne diseases, and diarrheal diseases in particular. Much of the existing work examines historical relationships between weather and diarrhea incidence, with a limited number of studies projecting future disease rates. Some studies take social and ecological factors into account in considerations of historical relationships, but few have done so in projecting future conditions.\nThe field is at a point of transition, toward incorporating social and ecological factors into understanding the relationships between climatic factors and diarrheal diseases and using this information for future projections. The integration of these components helps identify vulnerable populations and prioritize adaptation strategies.\nKeywords: Climate change, Diarrhea, Enteric diseases, Temperature, Rainfall, Social Vulnerability\nClimate change is increasingly understood not just as an environmental issue but as a fundamental threat to human health and well-being. The health effects of climate change \u201cthreaten to undermine the gains made in public health and development during the past half-century\u201d [e.g., 1].\nAnthropogenic climate change has caused increases in the number of warm days and nights, and the frequency and intensity of both droughts and heavy rainfall events [2]. This has implications for waterborne diseases, as high temperatures can alter pathogen survival, replication and virulence, heavy rainfall events can mobilize pathogens and compromise water and sanitation infrastructure, and drought can concentrate pathogens in limited water supplies [3\u2022\u2022]. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states that there is \u201cvery high confidence\u201d that increased risks of food- and water-borne diseases can be expected \u201cif climate change continues as projected across the representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios until mid-century\u201d [4].\nWaterborne diseases include many different types of infections that are transmitted via water, and include pathogens across a range of taxa (viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and helminths). These pathogens can cause an array of symptoms, including diarrhea, fever and other flu-like symptoms, neurological disorders, liver damage, and others. Here we focus on diarrheal diseases, which are commonly transmitted via waterborne pathways and comprise a substantial proportion of the global burden of diseases. [5, 6] Moreover, as diarrheal disease transmission is facilitated by insufficient or unsafe water, climate change has the potential to alter their distribution and incidence.\nDue to the large burden of diarrheal diseases, even small changes in diarrheal disease risk due to climate change can have profound impacts on population health. Diarrheal diseases are the second leading cause of death in children under five worldwide, and the second greatest source of death and disability in low and middle income countries [7, 8, 5]. These health impacts are concentrated in young children in low-income settings, where pediatric diarrhea can lead to impaired growth and cognitive development, and trigger a cascade of ill health that reinforces poverty [9\u201311]. Globally, diarrhea morbidity and mortality is declining [5], but climate change may slow this downward trajectory, undermining multinational investments to reduce diarrheal disease burden, with impacts concentrated in some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable populations.\nThe potential for climate change to affect diarrheal diseases was recognized starting with early efforts to estimate the impacts of anthropogenic climate change on human health [12, 13]. Diarrheal disease outbreaks have been associated with both heavy rainfall and dry periods [14\u201317], demonstrating that dry periods can concentrate enteric pathogens and precipitation can mobilize enteric pathogens, in both cases enabling contamination of drinking water sources and increasing chances of human-pathogen contact. Increases in hospital admissions in Lima, Peru during an El Ni\u00f1o warming event in the 1990s provided early epidemiological evidence of the potential for temperature anomalies to alter diarrheal disease incidence [18]. In the United States and Canada, waterborne disease outbreaks were found to often be preceded by extreme rainfall events [14, 17]. However, efforts to quantify the potential impacts of climate change on health have been hampered by, in the words of one research team, \u201cthe sparsity of empirical climate-health data\u201d leading to uncertainties in the empirical relationships between climate and diarrheal diseases far greater than uncertainties in the projection of future climate [19].\nSince these early efforts, a growing body of evidence suggests that climate change\u2014particularly increases in high temperatures, heavy rainfall, flooding and drought\u2014have the potential to alter the distribution of diarrheal diseases. We and others have found evidence of significant, positive associations between temperature and bacterial diarrhea, but not viral diarrhea [20\u2022\u2022, 21\u2022]; as well as evidence for increases in diarrhea following heavy rainfall events and flooding.\nAs the work describing associations between climate and diarrheal diseases grows, it is increasingly clear that the impacts of climate change on diarrheal diseases depend not simply on meteorological conditions, but on the underlying social and ecological contexts \u2013 from water and sanitation infrastructure to local pathogen distribution to social capital \u2013 that influence a population\u2019s exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. The complex interplay of climate, social\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Brandon Bell/Getty Images\nFlooding is the most common and costly(link is external) natural disaster in the U.S., and thanks to climate change, rising sea levels, wildfires, and changing precipitation patterns are increasing the number and intensity of extreme weather events with torrential rainfall(link is external). Already this year, there have been 39 flood-related deaths(link is external). Forecasters at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are predicting \u201cabove-normal\u201d hurricane activity(link is external) this season, adding to the flooding risk.\nClimate change is heating the oceans, too, and warmer-than-average ocean temperatures increase the amount of water that evaporates into the air, says Natalie Exum, PhD \u201916, MS, assistant professor in Environmental Health and Engineering. When more moisture-laden air moves over land or converges into a storm system, it can produce more intense precipitation\u2014such as heavier rain.\nIf the climate continues to warm, which most experts agree that it will, Exum says we will see even more flooding, and not only in the estuarine and coastal areas most at risk. Flood frequency in the U.S. is projected to more than triple by 2050 (relative to 2020) to reach an average of 45 to 85 flood days per year(link is external).\n\u201cI think [climate change] is closing in,\u201d Exum warns. \u201cThe oceans are rising, the rivers are getting breached, and the heavy rains are making floodwaters rush.\u201d\nWith the increasing intensity and frequency of extreme weather events, it\u2019s important to recognize and prepare for both the visible and the unseen dangers associated with flooding:\nAn increased risk of drowning, which is the leading cause of death(link is external) during flash floods and coastal floods(link is external). Even in shallow water, floodwater currents can be deadly. According to NOAA, just six inches of fast moving water can knock over an adult(link is external) and 1\u20132 feet of water can carry away most cars. The CDC reports that the most common flood deaths(link is external) occur when a vehicle is driven into hazardous floodwater.\nInjury from dangerous objects. Lumber, vehicles, and other debris like glass can get swept up by rushing waters. Wild or stray animals can also be carried along by floodwater and may bite if alive or present disease risk if dead. And downed power lines can pose electrocution risk.\nExposure to household and industrial chemicals. Floodwater may contain hazardous household waste (e.g. bleach, antifreeze, weed killers, drain cleaners, and cleaning solutions), medical waste (soiled dressings, body parts, bodily fluids, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices) and industrial waste (paints, acids, bases, radioactive materials, heavy metal solutions, and wastewater with hydrocarbons) that can cause illness. When heavy rainfall hits an area that is experiencing drought, pollutants such as pesticides, automobile fluids, and fertilizers that have accumulated on the ground are flushed in high concentrations into the water.\nExposure to pathogens. Continuous, heavy rainfall can cause rivers to overflow and may overwhelm and damage water infrastructure like sewer and drainage systems, contaminating floodwater with animal and human waste.\n\u201cAny type of floodwater that has sewage in it is extremely pathogenic\u201d Exum says. \u201cThe most immediate risk is gastrointestinal.\u201d It's easy to get sick from exposure, she explains, adding that after a flood, the heavily inundated areas see more acute gastrointestinal illness (AGI)-related emergency room visits.\nContaminated drinking water. Water treatment plants are often located next to rivers, making water treatment and distribution systems particularly vulnerable when flooding occurs. Much of U.S. water infrastructure is aging(link is external), compounding the issue. Just two years ago, historic flooding in Jackson, Mississippi, damaged operations at a water treatment plant leaving more than 150,000 people without safe drinking water for weeks.\nPublic drinking water systems have safety mechanisms in place to alert the community if the water is safe to drink or not, but for those with private wells, \u201cit\u2019s much harder to know if your well is contaminated,\u201d Exum says. It\u2019s crucial to keep alert for boil-water notices, and to test water before resuming consumption.\nIf contact with floodwater is unavoidable, minimizing exposure is key. \u201cYou don't want any type of open wound to be touching that water; that's a direct entry right into your body. When you do have contact with it, make sure that you're wearing the proper protective equipment\u2014gloves, waders, and eye and face masks,\" Exum says.\nIf you do come into contact with floodwater, the CDC recommends(link is external) that you:\nKeep in mind that contamination and other hazards can linger even after the flood has receded. Standing water creates the perfect breeding ground for mosquitoes, which are vectors for a number of diseases. Animal carcasses(link is external) may carry Salmonella and E. coli, and their decaying flesh may attract rats and other carrion-feeders. And some fungi, which flourish in dank, wet environments, may take root. \u201cMicrobes eventually die. You can disinfect them as you're cleaning up,\u201d Exum says. \u201cBut when you've got a saturated house\u2014it begins to grow mold.\u201d\nMorgan Coulson is an editorial associate in the Office of External Affairs at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\nJohns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health 615 N.

Building drought resilience for water utilities means increasing their ability to respond to water supply threats, withstand impacts from drought, and quickly recover when drought does occur.\nThis map shows current streamflow conditions at U.S. Geological Survey streamgages, compared to historical conditions for the same day of the year. Click on a streamgage to view more information.\nOperational Impacts\nDrought impacts on water utility operations range from loss of water supply to increased costs and reduced revenues.\nIncreasing Demand\nHigher temperatures result in increased water demand for both agricultural irrigation and drinking water supply.\nAquifer Depletion\nLimited surface water storage, among other factors, has contributed to significant depletion of aquifers in many U.S. regions.\nThe water sector is central to public health and the economy. Water utilities ensure a reliable supply of clean water to communities and ecosystems and contribute significantly to the resilience of many other sectors, including agriculture, energy, and manufacturing.\nDrought can result in impacts to water utility operations, including:\nIn dry years, many areas increase their reliance on groundwater. Groundwater provides more than 40 percent of the water used for U.S. agriculture and domestic water supplies. Increased pumping during droughts can reduce the future availability of those supplies, but strategies to replenish depleted underground aquifers can be helpful towards building drought resilience.\nThe water utility sector works to respond to water supply threats, withstand impacts from drought, and quickly recover when drought does occur. Drought and water shortage planning is not just a best management practice for water suppliers; it is a requirement in a growing number of states and water management districts. A water shortage plan enables a water supplier to assess the risks and reduce the vulnerability of a community to water shortage impacts, and to establish priorities that will provide water for public health and safety and minimize impacts on economic activity and environmental resources. Long-term drought resilience strategies should also consider projected climate conditions and incorporate planning to estimate demand and identify supply solutions well into the future.\nTo help the water utility sector build drought resilience, and even reduce risks from flooding, NIDIS is supporting research into Forecast-Informed Reservoir Operations(link is external) (FIRO). FIRO is a reservoir-operations strategy that uses enhanced monitoring and improved weather and water forecasts to inform decision making in selectively retaining or releasing water from reservoirs to optimize water supply reliability and reduce flood risk. FIRO is being developed and tested on Lake Mendocino in California as a collaborative effort among multiple agencies and organizations. NIDIS is also working with researchers, NOAA forecasters, and water utilities to learn what steps are needed to integrate NOAA forecasts in reservoir operations and water resources management in the Southern Great Plains (Texas and Oklahoma).\nDrought can imperil both the quantity and quality of the water supplied by utilities to the public. Therefore, early warning systems are vital for the water utility sector in strengthening its resilience to drought. The resources below are organized by the key components of a drought early warning system: (1) drought observation and monitoring; (2) drought planning and preparedness; (3) prediction and forecasting of drought; (4) communication and outreach to the public and affected sectors; and (5) interdisciplinary and applied research on topics of concern to drought-affected sectors.\nIdentify and access datasets and maps for monitoring water supply.\nA collection of tools for accessing observed and forecasted snow data.\nSTAY CONNECTED\nSubscribe to NIDIS emails for the latest regional drought updates, webinars, and news.

It entered into force on 4 November 2016. Today, 195 Parties (194 States plus the European Union) have joined the Paris Agreement.\nThe Agreement includes commitments from all countries to reduce their emissions and work together to adapt to the impacts of climate change, and calls on countries to strengthen their commitments over time.

It marks the beginning of a shift towards a net-zero emissions world. Implementation of the Agreement is also essential for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.\nThe Paris Agreement works on a five- year cycle of increasingly ambitious climate action carried out by countries. Every five years, each country is expected to submit an updated national climate action plan - known as Nationally Determined Contribution, or NDC.\nIn their NDCs, countries communicate actions they will take to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in order to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement. Countries also communicate in the NDCs actions they will take to build resilience to adapt to the impacts of rising temperatures.

Unlike NDCs, they are not mandatory.\nThe operational details for the practical implementation of the Paris Agreement were agreed on at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP24) in Katowice, Poland, in December 2018, in what is colloquially called the Paris Rulebook, and finalized at COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, in November 2021.\nMore information on the Paris Agreement can be found here.\nWhat is net zero?

From record-breaking warmth and prolonged dry spells to back-to-back heatwaves, the UK\u2019s weather has been making headlines and prompting some to ask, is this \u2018just summer\u2019?\nYesterday, further drought declarations were issued across parts of the UK, following what has been the driest January to June for England since 1976. This past weekend saw the third official heatwave of the summer, and temperatures are set to rise again at the end of this week.\nSpring 2025 was exceptional, going down as the UK\u2019s warmest and sunniest on record. June followed suit, becoming the warmest June ever recorded in England, and the second warmest for the UK in records since 1884.\nProvisional Met Office data up until (and including) 15 July shows that the UK\u2019s average mean temperature so far this summer sits 1.14\u00b0C above the long-term meteorological average for summer. England in particular has been well above average (1.58\u00b0C), whilst Scotland and Northern Ireland have remained closer to their seasonal averages.\nDaily minimum temperatures (the lowest temperature recorded during the 24-hour period from 09:00-09:00) are currently tracking well above average (0.78\u00b0C) for this point in the summer. The graph below, based on data from 1931, illustrates this.\nDaily maximum temperatures (the highest temperature recorded during the 24-hour period from 09:00-09:00) are also tracking above average \u2013 1.53\u00b0C as of the 15 July. England has seen especially high maximum temperatures, up 2.14\u00b0C on its summer average.\nThe graph below illustrates how daily maximum temperatures have been well above average across southern England since the start of spring. This has been in part, due to the three official heatwaves we have already seen this summer which can be seen on this chart.\nSo far, there have been 11 days in 2025 where temperatures have reached 30\u00b0C or higher. Based on station observations from 1931, this has only happened twice before up to this point in the summer - in 1976 and 2018.\nThe highest temperature of the year so far, 35.8\u00b0C, was reached on 1 July at Faversham in Kent. This remains below the UK\u2019s all-time high of 40.3\u00b0C, recorded in Coningsby, Lincolnshire, in July 2022. Temperatures reaching the low to mid 30s is becoming increasingly frequent as our climate continues to warm.\nRead: The UK's longest heatwave events and where they happened\nAs the climate continues to change, the UK is likely to see more frequent and intense heatwaves. A new Met Office study released in June highlights how UK heatwaves could become longer and hotter due to escalating climate trends, with an estimated 50-50 chance of seeing 40\u00b0C again in the UK in the next 12 years.\nThe UK continues to experience a significant marine heatwave at the moment, with the intensification linked with the land heatwave that we experienced last week. Marine heatwave conditions are likely to ease a little southwest of the UK in the coming days, as westerly winds strengthen. Sea temperatures will continue to increase in the central and northern North Sea however. The map below shows conditions around the UK on 14 July 2025.\nAll four UK nations have recorded above average sunshine so far this summer, with Northern Ireland seeing the least. This continues the theme from spring, which was also exceptionally sunny.\nFollowing an extremely dry spring, summer rainfall has remained just below average across the UK, with 45% of the whole summer\u2019s long-term average recorded.\nHowever, regional variation is significant. Large areas of eastern Wales and England have received less than 30% of their average summer rainfall whereas in contrast, parts of Cumbria have already received close to their full summer average, and we\u2019re only halfway through the season.\nEngland has been the driest of the four UK nations, recording just 37% of its average rainfall for the whole of summer. There\u2019s also a clear contrast between north and south, with southern England seeing 29% compared to northern England at 49%. Of particular note is the fact that the rainfall deficits that have built up through the spring have persisted and increased further in summer so far.\nThis is illustrated by the below graph, which shows how the rainfall deficit has built up across southern England so far this year.\nMet Office scientist Emily Carlisle explains: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say this summer has been typical so far when we look at the statistics. June was the warmest on record for England, with our records going back to 1884. That warmth has continued into July, with three heatwaves so far this summer and temperatures rising again later this week. There is of course, still a month-and-a-half of meteorological summer to go, so plenty of time for things to change.\u201d\nSeveral factors have contributed to the unusual warmth:\nPersistent high pressure: A dominant high-pressure system has been sitting over the UK, squashing the air and causing sinking air that suppresses cloud formation. This results in clear skies and strong sunshine, which heat the ground. With little wind and continued sunshine each day, temperatures build up over time.\nDry ground: The extremely dry spring has left soils parched. With less moisture available for evaporation, more solar energy goes directly into heating the air.\nMarine heatwave: Sea surface temperatures around the UK are currently well above average. As air passes over these warmer waters, it retains more heat.\nClimate change: The UK is warming. The newly released State of the UK Climate Report 2024 shows the UK is warming at a rate of approximately 0.25\u00b0C per decade. 2023, 2022 and 2018 are among the UK\u2019s top-ten warmest summers in records back to 1884.\nLooking ahead, the latter part of July and early August are expected to bring more typical British summer weather - changeable conditions with a mix of rain and sunshine.

It is an issue that requires international cooperation and coordinated solutions at all levels.\nTo tackle climate change and its negative impacts, world leaders at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris reached a breakthrough on 12 December 2015: the historic Paris Agreement.\nThe Agreement sets long-term goals to guide all nations to:\nThe Agreement is a legally binding international treaty. It entered into force on 4 November 2016. Today, 195 Parties (194 States plus the European Union) have joined the Paris Agreement.\nThe Agreement includes commitments from all countries to reduce their emissions and work together to adapt to the impacts of climate change, and calls on countries to strengthen their commitments over time. The Agreement provides a pathway for developed nations to assist developing nations in their climate mitigation and adaptation efforts while creating a framework for the transparent monitoring and reporting of countries\u2019 climate goals.\nThe Paris Agreement provides a durable framework guiding the global effort for decades to come. It marks the beginning of a shift towards a net-zero emissions world. Implementation of the Agreement is also essential for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.\nThe Paris Agreement works on a five- year cycle of increasingly ambitious climate action carried out by countries. Every five years, each country is expected to submit an updated national climate action plan - known as Nationally Determined Contribution, or NDC.\nIn their NDCs, countries communicate actions they will take to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in order to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement. Countries also communicate in the NDCs actions they will take to build resilience to adapt to the impacts of rising temperatures. In 2023, the first \u201cglobal stocktake\u201d of the world\u2019s efforts under the Paris Agreement concluded at COP28 with a decision on how to accelerate action across all areas \u2013 mitigation, adaptation, and finance \u2013 by 2030, including a call on governments to speed up the transition away from fossil fuels to renewable energy such as wind and solar power in their next round of climate commitments.\nTo better frame the efforts towards the long-term goal, the Paris Agreement invites countries to formulate and submit long-term strategies. Unlike NDCs, they are not mandatory.\nThe operational details for the practical implementation of the Paris Agreement were agreed on at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP24) in Katowice, Poland, in December 2018, in what is colloquially called the Paris Rulebook, and finalized at COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, in November 2021.\nMore information on the Paris Agreement can be found here.\nWhat is net zero?

While this growth rate has slowed recently, fossil emissions are still rising.\n\nFull Page Content:\nBy: Hannah Ritchie, Pablo Rosado, and Max Roser\nHuman emissions of greenhouse gases are the primary driver of climate change today.1\nCO2 and other greenhouse gases like methane and nitrous oxide are emitted when we burn fossil fuels, produce materials such as steel, cement, and plastics, and grow the food we eat. If we want to reduce these emissions, we need to transform our energy systems, industries, and food systems.\nAt the same time, we need to tackle energy poverty, low standards of living, and poor nutrition, which all remain enormous problems for billions of people.\nTechnological advances could allow us to do both. The prices of solar, wind, and batteries have plummeted in recent decades, increasingly undercutting the cost of fossil fuel alternatives. Further progress could allow us to provide cheap, clean energy for everyone. Political change is essential to create a system that supports rapid decarbonization.\nEmissions are still rising in many parts of the world. However, several countries have managed to cut their emissions in recent decades. With affordable low-carbon technologies, other countries can increase their living standards without the high-carbon pathway that rich countries followed in the past.\nOn this page, you can find our data, visualizations, and writing on CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions.\nHuman emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are the primary drivers of the global rise in temperatures.1 This link between global temperatures and greenhouse gas concentrations \u2013 especially CO2 \u2013 has been true throughout Earth\u2019s history.2\nIn the chart, we see the global average temperature relative to a baseline, which is the average between 1861 and 1890. This gives us an estimate of the temperature increase compared to \u201cpre-industrial\u201d times. Average global temperatures have risen by approximately 1.3\u00b0C since then (with even higher anomalies in the last few years).\nThis warming has not been equally distributed across the world. The Northern Hemisphere has warmed more than the Southern Hemisphere. In some regions, temperatures have risen by more than 5\u00b0C. You can see this distribution in maps published by Berkeley Earth.\nHuman emissions have been the main driver of this change. Aerosols have played a slight cooling role in global climate, and natural variability has played a minor role. This article from Carbon Brief explains this very well, with interactive graphics showing the relative contributions of different factors to the climate.\nSeptember 27, 2023\nThere are many ways to measure countries\u2019 contributions to climate change. What do they tell us?\nHannah Ritchie, Pablo Rosado, and Max Roser\nDecember 01, 2021\nIt is possible to reduce emissions while growing the economy. But this decoupling needs to happen faster.\nHannah Ritchie\nSeptember 29, 2023\nThe budget to keep temperatures below 1.5\u00b0C is less than a decade of current emissions. For 2\u00b0C, it\u2019s less than three decades.\nHannah Ritchie\nJune 23, 2020\nHannah Ritchie, Pablo Rosado, and Max Roser\nJune 10, 2020\nHannah Ritchie, Pablo Rosado, and Max Roser\nJune 10, 2020\nHannah Ritchie, Pablo Rosado, and Max Roser\nHannah Ritchie, Pablo Rosado, and Max Roser\nNovember 03, 2021\nMax Roser\nDecember 10, 2020\nMax Roser\nFebruary 10, 2020\nHannah Ritchie\nDecember 01, 2020\nMax Roser\nOctober 06, 2020\nHannah Ritchie\nAugust 30, 2023\nHannah Ritchie\nNovember 09, 2020\nHannah Ritchie\nApril 08, 2024\nHannah Ritchie\nJune 10, 2021\nHannah Ritchie\nNovember 06, 2019\nHannah Ritchie\nMarch 18, 2020\nHannah Ritchie\nMarch 18, 2021\nHannah Ritchie\nFebruary 04, 2020\nHannah Ritchie\nJanuary 24, 2020\nHannah Ritchie\nJune 01, 2021\nMax Roser\nOctober 14, 2022\nHannah Ritchie and Pablo Rosado\nSeptember 18, 2020\nHannah Ritchie\nOctober 07, 2019\nHannah Ritchie\nAugust 31, 2023\nHannah Ritchie\nIPCC, 2021: Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis.

(Image credit: Getty Images)\nScientists have found that how rain falls day to day throughout the year is nearly as important to the world\u2019s vegetation as how much. Reporting Dec. 11 in Nature, the researchers showed that even in years with similar rainfall totals, plants fared differently when that water came in fewer, bigger bursts.\nOverall, in years with less frequent but more concentrated rainfall, plants in drier environments like the U.S. Southwest were more likely to thrive. In humid ecosystems like the Central American rainforest, vegetation tended to fare worse, possibly because it was not adapted to the longer dry spells.\nScientists have previously estimated that almost half of the world\u2019s vegetation is driven primarily by how much rain falls in a year. Less well understood is the role of day-to-day variability, said lead author Andrew Feldman, a hydrologist and ecosystem scientist at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.\nGlobal warming is driving shifts in precipitation patterns that are producing stronger rainstorms \u2013 with longer dry spells in between \u2013 compared to a century ago. \u201cThat aspect of expected changes to future rainfall patterns is relatively well understood,\u201d said study co-author Alexandra Konings, associate professor of Earth system science at the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability. \u201cSo this new finding points to an area where further study might lead to significant improvements in our overall ability to predict future vegetation change.\u201d\nConsider how a houseplant might respond if you give it a pitcher of water each week \u2013 either portioned out every couple days, or dumped on the plant all at once, Feldman suggested. Scale that to the size of the Corn Belt or a rainforest and the answer could have implications for crop yields and ultimately how much carbon dioxide plants remove from the atmosphere.\nThe team, including researchers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and multiple universities, analyzed two decades of field and satellite observations, canvassing millions of square miles. Their study area encompassed diverse landscapes from Siberia in the north to the southern tip of Patagonia.\nThey found that plants across 42% of Earth\u2019s vegetated land surface were sensitive to daily rainfall variability. Of those, a little over half fared better in years with fewer but more intense wet days. These include croplands as well as drier landscapes like grasslands and deserts, which more commonly showed increased growth. In contrast, broadleaf forests, which have trees such as oak, maple, and beech \u2013 and rainforests in lower and mid-latitudes tended to fare worse under those conditions. The effect was especially pronounced in Southeast Asian rainforests across the Pacific Islands.\nOn average, daily rainfall variability was nearly as important as annual rainfall totals in driving growth worldwide. That level of importance is several times higher than previous estimates; the scientists attribute the new finding to a longer data record.\nThe new study relied primarily on a suite of NASA missions and datasets, including the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) algorithm, which provides rain and snowfall rates for most of the planet every 30 minutes using a network of international satellites.\nTo gauge plant response day to day, the researchers calculated how green an area appeared in satellite imagery. \u201cGreenness\u201d is commonly used to estimate vegetation density and health. They also tracked a faint reddish light that plants emit when they feed. During photosynthesis, when a plant absorbs sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into food, its chlorophyll \u201cleaks\u201d unused photons. This faint light is called solar-induced fluorescence, and it\u2019s a telltale sign of flourishing vegetation.\nInvisible to the naked eye, plant fluorescence can be detected by instruments aboard satellites such as NASA\u2019s Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2, or OCO-2. Launched in 2014, OCO-2 has observed the U.S. Midwest appearing to glow during the growing season.\nAs rising temperatures continue to alter weather patterns, Feldman said the findings highlight the vital role that plants play in moving carbon atoms around Earth \u2013 a process called the carbon cycle. Vegetation, including farmlands, forms a vast carbon sink, absorbing excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\nA finer understanding of how plants thrive or decline day to day, storm by storm, could help us better understand their role in that critical cycle, Feldman said.\nThis story was adapted from a press release originally published by NASA.\nAdditional co-authors are affiliated with Columbia University, Indiana University, University of Arizona, and NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.The research was supported by NASA, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, the U.S. National Science Foundation, and the Swiss National Science Foundation.\nBased on new analyses of satellite data, scientists have found that hydrologic conditions that increase flash drought risk occur more often than current models predict. The research also shows that incorporating how plants change soil structures can improve Earth system models.\nIn a 34-year global analysis, researchers found that photosynthesis \u2013 an important process for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it in soil \u2013 was controlled by extreme wet events nearly as often as droughts in certain locations.\nNew research suggests dry air combined with warmer temperatures may prompt bigger than expected changes in how water moves through plants.

June followed suit, becoming the warmest June ever recorded in England, and the second warmest for the UK in records since 1884.\nProvisional Met Office data up until (and including) 15 July shows that the UK\u2019s average mean temperature so far this summer sits 1.14\u00b0C above the long-term meteorological average for summer. England in particular has been well above average (1.58\u00b0C), whilst Scotland and Northern Ireland have remained closer to their seasonal averages.\nDaily minimum temperatures (the lowest temperature recorded during the 24-hour period from 09:00-09:00) are currently tracking well above average (0.78\u00b0C) for this point in the summer. The graph below, based on data from 1931, illustrates this.\nDaily maximum temperatures (the highest temperature recorded during the 24-hour period from 09:00-09:00) are also tracking above average \u2013 1.53\u00b0C as of the 15 July. England has seen especially high maximum temperatures, up 2.14\u00b0C on its summer average.\nThe graph below illustrates how daily maximum temperatures have been well above average across southern England since the start of spring. This has been in part, due to the three official heatwaves we have already seen this summer which can be seen on this chart.\nSo far, there have been 11 days in 2025 where temperatures have reached 30\u00b0C or higher. Based on station observations from 1931, this has only happened twice before up to this point in the summer - in 1976 and 2018.\nThe highest temperature of the year so far, 35.8\u00b0C, was reached on 1 July at Faversham in Kent. This remains below the UK\u2019s all-time high of 40.3\u00b0C, recorded in Coningsby, Lincolnshire, in July 2022. Temperatures reaching the low to mid 30s is becoming increasingly frequent as our climate continues to warm.\nRead: The UK's longest heatwave events and where they happened\nAs the climate continues to change, the UK is likely to see more frequent and intense heatwaves. A new Met Office study released in June highlights how UK heatwaves could become longer and hotter due to escalating climate trends, with an estimated 50-50 chance of seeing 40\u00b0C again in the UK in the next 12 years.\nThe UK continues to experience a significant marine heatwave at the moment, with the intensification linked with the land heatwave that we experienced last week. Marine heatwave conditions are likely to ease a little southwest of the UK in the coming days, as westerly winds strengthen. Sea temperatures will continue to increase in the central and northern North Sea however. The map below shows conditions around the UK on 14 July 2025.\nAll four UK nations have recorded above average sunshine so far this summer, with Northern Ireland seeing the least. This continues the theme from spring, which was also exceptionally sunny.\nFollowing an extremely dry spring, summer rainfall has remained just below average across the UK, with 45% of the whole summer\u2019s long-term average recorded.\nHowever, regional variation is significant. Large areas of eastern Wales and England have received less than 30% of their average summer rainfall whereas in contrast, parts of Cumbria have already received close to their full summer average, and we\u2019re only halfway through the season.\nEngland has been the driest of the four UK nations, recording just 37% of its average rainfall for the whole of summer. There\u2019s also a clear contrast between north and south, with southern England seeing 29% compared to northern England at 49%. Of particular note is the fact that the rainfall deficits that have built up through the spring have persisted and increased further in summer so far.\nThis is illustrated by the below graph, which shows how the rainfall deficit has built up across southern England so far this year.\nMet Office scientist Emily Carlisle explains: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say this summer has been typical so far when we look at the statistics. June was the warmest on record for England, with our records going back to 1884. That warmth has continued into July, with three heatwaves so far this summer and temperatures rising again later this week. There is of course, still a month-and-a-half of meteorological summer to go, so plenty of time for things to change.\u201d\nSeveral factors have contributed to the unusual warmth:\nPersistent high pressure: A dominant high-pressure system has been sitting over the UK, squashing the air and causing sinking air that suppresses cloud formation. This results in clear skies and strong sunshine, which heat the ground. With little wind and continued sunshine each day, temperatures build up over time.\nDry ground: The extremely dry spring has left soils parched. With less moisture available for evaporation, more solar energy goes directly into heating the air.\nMarine heatwave: Sea surface temperatures around the UK are currently well above average. As air passes over these warmer waters, it retains more heat.\nClimate change: The UK is warming. The newly released State of the UK Climate Report 2024 shows the UK is warming at a rate of approximately 0.25\u00b0C per decade. 2023, 2022 and 2018 are among the UK\u2019s top-ten warmest summers in records back to 1884.\nLooking ahead, the latter part of July and early August are expected to bring more typical British summer weather - changeable conditions with a mix of rain and sunshine.

Limited water availability can cause plant stress, leading to reduced crop yields and quality.\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nNational Integrated Drought Information System\nDrought can result in significant operational impacts to water utilities, including a loss of water supply and poor source water quality. Building drought resilience for water utilities means increasing their ability to respond to water supply threats, withstand impacts from drought, and quickly recover when drought does occur.\nThis map shows current streamflow conditions at U.S. Geological Survey streamgages, compared to historical conditions for the same day of the year. Click on a streamgage to view more information.\nOperational Impacts\nDrought impacts on water utility operations range from loss of water supply to increased costs and reduced revenues.\nIncreasing Demand\nHigher temperatures result in increased water demand for both agricultural irrigation and drinking water supply.\nAquifer Depletion\nLimited surface water storage, among other factors, has contributed to significant depletion of aquifers in many U.S. regions.\nThe water sector is central to public health and the economy. Water utilities ensure a reliable supply of clean water to communities and ecosystems and contribute significantly to the resilience of many other sectors, including agriculture, energy, and manufacturing.\nDrought can result in impacts to water utility operations, including:\nIn dry years, many areas increase their reliance on groundwater. Groundwater provides more than 40 percent of the water used for U.S. agriculture and domestic water supplies. Increased pumping during droughts can reduce the future availability of those supplies, but strategies to replenish depleted underground aquifers can be helpful towards building drought resilience.\nThe water utility sector works to respond to water supply threats, withstand impacts from drought, and quickly recover when drought does occur. Drought and water shortage planning is not just a best management practice for water suppliers; it is a requirement in a growing number of states and water management districts. A water shortage plan enables a water supplier to assess the risks and reduce the vulnerability of a community to water shortage impacts, and to establish priorities that will provide water for public health and safety and minimize impacts on economic activity and environmental resources. Long-term drought resilience strategies should also consider projected climate conditions and incorporate planning to estimate demand and identify supply solutions well into the future.\nTo help the water utility sector build drought resilience, and even reduce risks from flooding, NIDIS is supporting research into Forecast-Informed Reservoir Operations(link is external) (FIRO). FIRO is a reservoir-operations strategy that uses enhanced monitoring and improved weather and water forecasts to inform decision making in selectively retaining or releasing water from reservoirs to optimize water supply reliability and reduce flood risk. FIRO is being developed and tested on Lake Mendocino in California as a collaborative effort among multiple agencies and organizations. NIDIS is also working with researchers, NOAA forecasters, and water utilities to learn what steps are needed to integrate NOAA forecasts in reservoir operations and water resources management in the Southern Great Plains (Texas and Oklahoma).\nDrought can imperil both the quantity and quality of the water supplied by utilities to the public. Therefore, early warning systems are vital for the water utility sector in strengthening its resilience to drought. The resources below are organized by the key components of a drought early warning system: (1) drought observation and monitoring; (2) drought planning and preparedness; (3) prediction and forecasting of drought; (4) communication and outreach to the public and affected sectors; and (5) interdisciplinary and applied research on topics of concern to drought-affected sectors.\nIdentify and access datasets and maps for monitoring water supply.\nA collection of tools for accessing observed and forecasted snow data.\nSTAY CONNECTED\nSubscribe to NIDIS emails for the latest regional drought updates, webinars, and news.

(IPCC)\nUnder the Paris Agreement, countries agreed to substantially reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to enable the long-term global average surface temperature increase to be kept well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5\u00b0C.(Paris Agreement)\nCountries have emphasized that the impacts of climate change would be much lower at a temperature increase of 1.5\u00b0C, compared with 2\u00b0C, and expressed their firm resolve to pursue efforts to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C.(COP outcomes; IPCC)\nMonthly and annual breaches of 1.5\u00b0C do not mean that the world has failed to achieve the Paris Agreement\u2019s temperature goal, which refers to a long-term temperature increase over decades, not individual months or years. Temperatures for any single month or year fluctuate due to natural variability, including El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a and volcanic eruptions. Consequently, long-term temperature changes are typically considered on decadal timescales. (WMO)\nThe year 2024 was the warmest year in the 175-year observational record, with a global mean near-surface temperature 1.55\u00b0C above the 1850\u20131900 average.\nNevertheless, breaches of 1.5\u00b0C for a month or a year are early signs of getting perilously close to exceeding the long-term limit, and serve as clarion calls for increasing ambition and accelerating action in this critical decade. (UNEP).\nGlobal temperature changes are typically measured against the average temperature over a historical, pre-industrial baseline of 1850\u20131900. This baseline is the earliest period for which high-quality observations of surface temperatures over the land and ocean are available. (IPCC).\nThe first months with an average temperature that was more than 1.5\u00b0C above the pre-industrial average occurred during 2015-16, driven by both human-caused climate change and a strong, naturally occurring El Ni\u00f1o. The latter part of 2023 and early 2024 also experienced monthly average global temperature anomalies above 1.5\u00b0C. (WMO)\nThe first 12-month period to exceed 1.5\u00b0C as an average was February 2023 \u2013 January 2024, boosted by El Ni\u00f1o, when the average temperature worldwide was estimated to be 1.52\u00b0C higher than 1850\u20131900, according to one scientific dataset (Copernicus Climate Change Service). The likelihood of the annual average global temperature exceeding 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels for at least one year over the coming five years has increased significantly since 2015, when it was close to zero (WMO).\nThe global average temperature for the most recent 10-year period, from 2015 to 2024, is estimated to be the warmest 10-year period on record, at around 1.24 to 1.28\u00b0C above the 1850-1900 average (EEA). The 20-year average warming for 2001\u20132020 relative to 1850\u20131900 is 0.99\u00b0C (IPCC).\nEvery fraction of a degree of warming matters. With every additional increment of global warming, changes in extremes and risks become larger. For example, every additional 0.1\u00b0C of global warming causes clearly discernible increases in the intensity and frequency of temperature and precipitation extremes, as well as agricultural and ecological droughts in some regions. (IPCC)\nLimiting global warming to below 1.5\u00b0C will significantly reduce the risks, adverse impacts, and related losses and damages from climate change. Failing to do so will lead to increasingly frequent and dangerous extreme weather events including heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, and heavy precipitation and flooding (IPCC). Extreme heat causes the greatest mortality of all extreme weather, with an estimated 489,000 heat-related deaths per year between 2000 and 2019 (WMO). Exceeding 1.5\u00b0C could also trigger multiple climate tipping points \u2014 such as breakdowns of major ocean circulation systems, abrupt thawing of boreal permafrost, and collapse of tropical coral reef systems \u2014 with abrupt, irreversible, and dangerous impacts for humanity.(Science)\nEven at current levels of global warming, we are already seeing devastating climate impacts, including intensifying extreme weather events, alarming reductions in ice sheets, sea ice, and glaciers, and several mass coral bleaching events, with widespread harms to people, economies, and nature (IPCC). In the last two decades, the 55 most climate-vulnerable economies alone have already experienced climate damages exceeding US$ 500 billion (UNEP). In 2024, disasters triggered a record 45.8 million internal displacements, of which 99.5 per cent were caused by weather-related hazards such as floods, storms, wildfires and droughts (UNDRR).\nHuman health impacts from climate change have been apparent for at least 20 years, but the climate crisis is still not treated like other global public health emergencies. Between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year from undernutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress alone. The cumulative death toll will likely be much higher, as climate change acts as a threat multiplier of many other extreme weather events and public health risks. (WHO)\nMany climate impacts, especially sea-level rise from ice sheets, disappearance of mountain glaciers, and ocean acidification, are essentially permanent for many generations to come and will take centuries to thousands of years to restore to even today\u2019s conditions. To minimize losses and damages, it is crucial to minimize the magnitude and duration of temporarily exceeding 1.5\u00b0C by urgently and significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions and phasing out fossil fuels. (New insights; IPCC)\nUnder global modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C with no or limited temporary overshoot, global greenhouse gas emissions peak by 2025, and are reduced by 43% by 2030 relative to 2019. carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reach net zero by 2050.

The likelihood of the annual average global temperature exceeding 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels for at least one year over the coming five years has increased significantly since 2015, when it was close to zero (WMO).\nThe global average temperature for the most recent 10-year period, from 2015 to 2024, is estimated to be the warmest 10-year period on record, at around 1.24 to 1.28\u00b0C above the 1850-1900 average (EEA). The 20-year average warming for 2001\u20132020 relative to 1850\u20131900 is 0.99\u00b0C (IPCC).\nEvery fraction of a degree of warming matters. With every additional increment of global warming, changes in extremes and risks become larger. For example, every additional 0.1\u00b0C of global warming causes clearly discernible increases in the intensity and frequency of temperature and precipitation extremes, as well as agricultural and ecological droughts in some regions. (IPCC)\nLimiting global warming to below 1.5\u00b0C will significantly reduce the risks, adverse impacts, and related losses and damages from climate change. Failing to do so will lead to increasingly frequent and dangerous extreme weather events including heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, and heavy precipitation and flooding (IPCC). Extreme heat causes the greatest mortality of all extreme weather, with an estimated 489,000 heat-related deaths per year between 2000 and 2019 (WMO). Exceeding 1.5\u00b0C could also trigger multiple climate tipping points \u2014 such as breakdowns of major ocean circulation systems, abrupt thawing of boreal permafrost, and collapse of tropical coral reef systems \u2014 with abrupt, irreversible, and dangerous impacts for humanity.(Science)\nEven at current levels of global warming, we are already seeing devastating climate impacts, including intensifying extreme weather events, alarming reductions in ice sheets, sea ice, and glaciers, and several mass coral bleaching events, with widespread harms to people, economies, and nature (IPCC). In the last two decades, the 55 most climate-vulnerable economies alone have already experienced climate damages exceeding US$ 500 billion (UNEP). In 2024, disasters triggered a record 45.8 million internal displacements, of which 99.5 per cent were caused by weather-related hazards such as floods, storms, wildfires and droughts (UNDRR).\nHuman health impacts from climate change have been apparent for at least 20 years, but the climate crisis is still not treated like other global public health emergencies. Between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year from undernutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress alone. The cumulative death toll will likely be much higher, as climate change acts as a threat multiplier of many other extreme weather events and public health risks.

(IPCC)\nUnder the Paris Agreement, countries agreed to substantially reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to enable the long-term global average surface temperature increase to be kept well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5\u00b0C.(Paris Agreement)\nCountries have emphasized that the impacts of climate change would be much lower at a temperature increase of 1.5\u00b0C, compared with 2\u00b0C, and expressed their firm resolve to pursue efforts to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C.(COP outcomes; IPCC)\nMonthly and annual breaches of 1.5\u00b0C do not mean that the world has failed to achieve the Paris Agreement\u2019s temperature goal, which refers to a long-term temperature increase over decades, not individual months or years. Temperatures for any single month or year fluctuate due to natural variability, including El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a and volcanic eruptions. Consequently, long-term temperature changes are typically considered on decadal timescales. (WMO)\nThe year 2024 was the warmest year in the 175-year observational record, with a global mean near-surface temperature 1.55\u00b0C above the 1850\u20131900 average.\nNevertheless, breaches of 1.5\u00b0C for a month or a year are early signs of getting perilously close to exceeding the long-term limit, and serve as clarion calls for increasing ambition and accelerating action in this critical decade. (UNEP).\nGlobal temperature changes are typically measured against the average temperature over a historical, pre-industrial baseline of 1850\u20131900. This baseline is the earliest period for which high-quality observations of surface temperatures over the land and ocean are available. (IPCC).\nThe first months with an average temperature that was more than 1.5\u00b0C above the pre-industrial average occurred during 2015-16, driven by both human-caused climate change and a strong, naturally occurring El Ni\u00f1o.

Extreme heat can also worsen air quality problems and ground-level ozone, exacerbate drought and wildfire risk, reduce labour productivity, damage infrastructure and reduce crop yields.\nThere are many ways to measure extreme heat. Absolute temperature is one, but a key factor for the impacts of heat extremes is also how much higher temperatures are compared to normal for a specific location.\nTo assess how the incidence of extreme heat has changed over time, Carbon Brief has examined which regions experienced all-time daily heat records in each year since 1950.\nThe analysis shows that the number of people experiencing all-time high heat events has increased dramatically over the past three decades. Overall, about half the world\u2019s population is living in regions that saw their hottest daily temperatures since 1950 during the past 10 years.\nIn 2022 alone \u2013 which was the fifth or sixth warmest year on record for the Earth\u2019s surface as a whole across different datasets \u2013 approximately 380 million people saw their hottest single hourly temperature ever recorded.\nIn the map below, the red shading indicates areas that saw their warmest daily temperatures since 1950 in 2022.\nAs you scroll, you will see the areas experiencing their warmest temperatures on record over the past two years (that is, 2021 and 2022) and all the way back to the past 10 years (2013-2022). Over the past decade, approximately 40% of the Earth\u2019s surface experienced its warmest temperatures on record.\nAreas experiencing record heat last year\nAreas experiencing record heat last year\nShare of world experiencing record heat\nShare of world experiencing record heat\nWhen scientists talk about record temperatures it can mean a number of different things. Often scientists focus on the hottest month or year on record for the Earth as a whole. This generally refers to the largest increase in temperatures relative to the historical average \u2013 known as the temperature \u201canomaly\u201d.\nAn alternative metric to look at the changing climate is how the hottest temperature recorded over the course of the year has changed over time. This only provides part of the story \u2013 there are real impacts of warming in other parts of the year \u2013 but is important in assessing extreme heat stress.\nIn this analysis, Carbon Brief uses ERA5 \u2013 a state-of-the-art reanalysis product from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) \u2013 to look at how the hottest maximum daily temperature of the year has changed over time for every part of the planet.\nIn essence, a reanalysis product is a weather model run backwards in time. To produce daily weather forecasts, groups such as ECMWF take into account massive amounts of data from satellites, aircraft, radar, weather balloons, weather stations and automated buoys. A reanalysis record creates these \u201cweather forecasts\u201d for each day backwards in time and can track changes in different data input sources to detect and correct for changes in the way that measurements are made over time.\nThe figure below shows the global average surface temperature from ERA5 for each day between 1950 and the end of 2022. While there is a lot of day-to-day variation in global temperatures \u2013 and even more in any individual part of the planet \u2013 the long-term warming trend is quite clear in the daily temperature data, with current temperatures around 1C warmer on average than those of the 1950s.\nWhile the world as a whole has warmed rapidly and experienced an increasing amount of record heat, people do not live in that global average.\nIn order to assess the number of people experiencing record heat, Carbon Brief combined the ERA5 all-time hottest temperature data with global population estimates from NASA and Columbia University.\nAs global population has increased over time, more people would be experiencing record heat events even if the climate were not changing \u2013 simply due to the fact that there are more people. To isolate the effect of climate change on the number of all-time record heat events the population is experiencing, the analysis holds the global population constant at 2020 levels and looks back in time at how many all-time record heat events would have been experienced if population remained unchanged.\nThe figure below shows the number of people who would have experienced all-time record heat events in each year if the global population remained fixed at 2020 levels.\nIf the climate were not warming, there would still be some year-to-year natural variability in the number of record heat events experienced, but the line would remain relatively flat. However, the world is warming and, thus, the portion of the population that has experienced all-time record heat has increased dramatically.\nAt the 2020 level of global population, approximately 6.3 billion people live in areas that have seen all-time record heat over the past 30 years \u2013 and 3.5 billion people have experienced all-time record heat in the past decade alone.\nDuring the past decade, a number of regions stand out as experiencing particularly widespread extreme heat events.

For one, water generally evaporates more quickly at higher temperatures. For that ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nYale Climate Connections\n[Para leer en espa\u00f1ol, haga clic aqu\u00ed]\nFor tens of millions of Americans, drought has become an ever-present natural disaster.\nThat\u2019s particularly true in the Western United States. Because of the West\u2019s largely semi-arid and desert climates, droughts are natural occurrences across the region. However, regional climate isn\u2019t the only culprit in drought activity. Climate change, namely rising average temperatures driven by human-generated emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases, is contributing to droughts, too.\nGlobal warming increases the risk of drought in several ways.\nFor one, water generally evaporates more quickly at higher temperatures. For that reason, hotter weather can result in drier soils. As high air temperatures sap liquid water from soils and plant leaves, transforming it into atmospheric water vapor via a process called transpiration, ground-level drying will increase in some regions. (Ironically, this additional atmospheric moisture triggers heavier downpours in other regions, which explains why the overall trend in the U.S. has been toward wetter conditions.)\nHigher air temperatures not only encourage drought conditions to build but also intensify them. What might have otherwise been a mild or moderate drought in a cooler world will become, in a warmer world, more severe as a result of increased evaporation.\nWarming also diminishes snowfall, an essential water resource for the estimated 1.9 billion residents of the Northern Hemisphere who depend on snowpacks, or snow reservoirs that store water during the cooler months and release it when it\u2019s needed in the warmer, drier months. Rising temperatures increase the fraction of winter precipitation that falls as rain rather than snow and also shorten the cold season, so there\u2019s less time for snow to even occur. Such was the case in 2015, the fourth-warmest year in the contiguous U.S., when a snow drought reduced the April snowpack in the Sierra Nevada mountain range to a mere 5% of its historical average water content \u2014 its lowest snowpack in 500 years.\nSeasonal melting of snowpacks can be thrown off-kilter, too. As average temperatures warm above freezing earlier in the spring, snowmelt occurs sooner and faster than usual. And rapid melting results in a shorter period during which soils and plants are kept moist.\nAnother way a warmer atmosphere can disrupt precipitation is by shifting storm tracks. Ordinarily, low-pressure systems known as extratropical cyclones form between 30 and 60 degrees latitude north and south of the equator. But as the climate warms globally, storms are shifting toward the poles. This means that weather features such as atmospheric rivers, which supply as much as 50% of annual precipitation to states in the Western U.S., could cease to pass over regions where their moisture is much-needed.\nScientists see a clear correlation between droughts and global warming. But a correlation between two events doesn\u2019t always mean one caused the other. For example, ice cream sales often increase around the time that baseball game attendance rises, but that does not mean that eating ice cream causes people to attend baseball games. Nor does it mean that attending baseball games causes people to eat ice cream.\nIt can be tricky to attribute an increase in droughts to global warming because droughts are variable. In other words, they can occur every year or every few years, last for years or decades, and cause varying levels of dryness. That makes it difficult to distinguish random events from those possibly shaped by human-caused warming. However, the more drought dovetails with trends of increasing temperature, decreasing precipitation, and with computer model projections, the more confident scientists are in pointing to climate change.\nIn a 2020 study in the journal Science, for example, researchers observed how human-caused climate change is contributing to the 21st-century megadrought in the Western U.S. and northern Mexico by evaluating trends in modeled temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation data between 1901 and 2018. According to the study\u2019s findings, human-caused warming accounts for 46% of this drought\u2019s severity.\nWhat about the rest of the world? Scientists have been cautious about linking human activities to global drought patterns, largely because drought hasn\u2019t occurred as uniformly worldwide as it has across individual regions. That said, building evidence supports the climate change-drought connection on a global scale.\nAccording to an August 2021 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, scientists have high confidence that for every half degree Celsius (0.9 degree Fahrenheit) the atmosphere warms, noticeable increases will occur in some regions in the intensity and frequency of droughts that harm agriculture and ecosystems. Similarly, the report notes that extreme agricultural and ecological drought events that used to occur once every 10 years are now 1.7 times more likely than they were from 1850 to 1900, before humans heavily influenced the climate.\nWhile the intricacies of the climate change-drought connection are still being uncovered, scientists tend to agree on one thing: Droughts will likely become more intense into the 2050s and beyond. The likelihood of megadroughts \u2013 droughts lasting 10 years or more \u2013 is also projected to increase from its current 12% to more than 60%, a NASA study warns.\nA conservation mindset is one of the best defenses against drought and its associated risks of wildfire, crop failure, energy crises, and more. Whether you\u2019re preparing for a drought or are already experiencing one, strengthen your resilience by taking these actions:\nAlthough drought is an immense concern now and in the future, taking small actions such as these can have cascading benefits.\nEditor\u2019s note: This story was originally published Aug. 18, 2021 and was updated May 8, 2023.\nRepublish This Story\nRepublish our articles for free, online or in \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

But as climate change makes heat waves more intense and more frequent, we need to be cognizant of the dangers and health risks that come with it.\nOver the coming decades, every region of the US is expected to experience hotter temperatures and more frequent and intense heat waves.

When extreme daytime temperatures persist over a prolonged period (usually at least two days), it is often referred to as a heat wave.\nThe human body sweats to cool itself when exposed to high temperatures. In humid conditions, sweat does not evaporate as quickly and the body\u2019s ability to cool itself is compromised. Heat stress can result and, if not addressed, can lead to heat-related illnesses like heat exhaustion and heat stroke. The impacts of temperature extremes on human health and well-being are therefore generally considered in concert with humidity to measure heat stress conditions: those in which the human body has difficulty cooling itself.\nExtreme heat events can be measured in a few different ways: the maximum temperatures hit (intensity), how often the events occur (frequency), or how long they last (duration). The Dust Bowl era of the 1930s holds the record for peak frequency, intensity, and duration of heat waves across much of the United States to this day\u2014but the frequency and intensity of heat waves have increased in the last several decades in many regions.\nIn addition to changes in extreme temperatures alone, studies of heat stress trends over the late 20th to early 21st century found increases across much of the country in the conditions that cause heat stress for humans. In a study of changes in extreme heat stress conditions at 187 weather stations across the US between 1949 and 2005, 20 percent of the stations had recorded a substantial increase in the number of one-day, extreme heat stress events (relative to local conditions between 1961 and 1990). On average, these stations recorded 12 more days with extreme heat stress per year in 2005 than they did in 1949.\nIn the next few decades, if carbon emissions continue to grow, most of the country could see 20 to 30 more days annually with maximum temperatures above 90 degrees Fahrenheit. The Southeast could be hit even harder, potentially enduring 40 to 50 more such days.\nBy 2100, all parts of the United States are likely to experience more heat waves, with the Southeast, Southwest, and Alaska likely to see the biggest increases. Not only will these heat waves be more frequent, they will also be hotter than what we experience today. If carbon emissions continue to increase substantially, the hottest daily temperatures that occur in a given year in the United States are likely to increase by at least 10\u00b0F as compared to the end of the 20th century.\nHeat is among the deadliest extreme weather hazards in the United States. When exposure to heat is high enough to raise the body's core temperature, heat stress illness\u2014which encompasses heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke\u2014can occur.\nWith heat cramps, an individual experiences muscle pain or spasms. Heat exhaustion can cause dizziness, a weak pulse, nausea, and fainting. The most severe heat-related illness, heat stroke, occurs when a person\u2019s temperature increases above 103\u00b0F. Increased daily air temperatures or periods of extended high temperatures have also been shown to increase cardiovascular mortality, respiratory mortality, and heart attacks.\nSome US residents are at greater risk of adverse health effects and death from extreme heat. Low-income residents, the young and elderly, construction and agricultural workers, individuals with pre-existing medical conditions, and people living in the center of urban areas can be more vulnerable to physical harm from heat.\nExtreme heat can affect many aspects of daily life and routines, including:\nBy stabilizing global carbon emissions in the next few decades (so that atmospheric carbon dioxide remains below 550 parts per million by 2100), the frequency of heat waves the US is likely to see around mid-century would be reduced by approximately 50 percent, compared to a scenario in which carbon emissions continue to increase rapidly through to 2100.\nIf the global community pursues aggressive emissions reductions in line with the Paris Agreement goal of keeping warming below 3.6\u00b0F, the hottest daily temperatures that occur each year in many parts of the country are likely to increase by just 3.6\u00b0F instead of by 10\u00b0F, as compared to the higher-emissions scenario.\nIndividuals and communities need policies and infrastructure that take better account of more frequent, intense, and longer-lasting extreme heat. For example, in the coming decades increased reliance on air conditioning to cope with extreme heat is likely to contribute to increased global warming emissions, worsening air quality, and an increase in air pollution\u2013related mortality unless we more aggressively invest in clean energy technology, energy conservation, and energy efficiency measures.\nExisting policies also need to be leveraged and new policies enacted to better help people\u2014particularly outdoor workers, children, low-income and minority groups, elderly people, and athletes\u2014to cope with extreme heat. Policies that ensure the safety of all outdoor workers, documented or otherwise, and expand access to and awareness of \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Temperatures for any single month or year fluctuate due to natural variability, including El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a and volcanic eruptions. Consequently, long-term temperature changes are typically considered on decadal timescales. (WMO)\nThe year 2024 was the warmest year in the 175-year observational record, with a global mean near-surface temperature 1.55\u00b0C above the 1850\u20131900 average.\nNevertheless, breaches of 1.5\u00b0C for a month or a year are early signs of getting perilously close to exceeding the long-term limit, and serve as clarion calls for increasing ambition and accelerating action in this critical decade. (UNEP).\nGlobal temperature changes are typically measured against the average temperature over a historical, pre-industrial baseline of 1850\u20131900. This baseline is the earliest period for which high-quality observations of surface temperatures over the land and ocean are available. (IPCC).\nThe first months with an average temperature that was more than 1.5\u00b0C above the pre-industrial average occurred during 2015-16, driven by both human-caused climate change and a strong, naturally occurring El Ni\u00f1o. The latter part of 2023 and early 2024 also experienced monthly average global temperature anomalies above 1.5\u00b0C. (WMO)\nThe first 12-month period to exceed 1.5\u00b0C as an average was February 2023 \u2013 January 2024, boosted by El Ni\u00f1o, when the average temperature worldwide was estimated to be 1.52\u00b0C higher than 1850\u20131900, according to one scientific dataset (Copernicus Climate Change Service). The likelihood of the annual average global temperature exceeding 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels for at least one year over the coming five years has increased significantly since 2015, when it was close to zero (WMO).\nThe global average temperature for the most recent 10-year period, from 2015 to 2024, is estimated to be the warmest 10-year period on record, at around 1.24 to 1.28\u00b0C above the 1850-1900 average (EEA). The 20-year average warming for 2001\u20132020 relative to 1850\u20131900 is 0.99\u00b0C (IPCC).\nEvery fraction of a degree of warming matters. With every additional increment of global warming, changes in extremes and risks become larger. For example, every additional 0.1\u00b0C of global warming causes clearly discernible increases in the intensity and frequency of temperature and precipitation extremes, as well as agricultural and ecological droughts in some regions. (IPCC)\nLimiting global warming to below 1.5\u00b0C will significantly reduce the risks, adverse impacts, and related losses and damages from climate change. Failing to do so will lead to increasingly frequent and dangerous extreme weather events including heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, and heavy precipitation and flooding (IPCC). Extreme heat causes the greatest mortality of all extreme weather, with an estimated 489,000 heat-related deaths per year between 2000 and 2019 (WMO). Exceeding 1.5\u00b0C could also trigger multiple climate tipping points \u2014 such as breakdowns of major ocean circulation systems, abrupt thawing of boreal permafrost, and collapse of tropical coral reef systems \u2014 with abrupt, irreversible, and dangerous impacts for humanity.(Science)\nEven at current levels of global warming, we are already seeing devastating climate impacts, including intensifying extreme weather events, alarming reductions in ice sheets, sea ice, and glaciers, and several mass coral bleaching events, with widespread harms to people, economies, and nature (IPCC). In the last two decades, the 55 most climate-vulnerable economies alone have already experienced climate damages exceeding US$ 500 billion (UNEP). In 2024, disasters triggered a record 45.8 million internal displacements, of which 99.5 per cent were caused by weather-related hazards such as floods, storms, wildfires and droughts (UNDRR).\nHuman health impacts from climate change have been apparent for at least 20 years, but the climate crisis is still not treated like other global public health emergencies. Between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year from undernutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress alone. The cumulative death toll will likely be much higher, as climate change acts as a threat multiplier of many other extreme weather events and public health risks. (WHO)\nMany climate impacts, especially sea-level rise from ice sheets, disappearance of mountain glaciers, and ocean acidification, are essentially permanent for many generations to come and will take centuries to thousands of years to restore to even today\u2019s conditions.

Extreme heat can also worsen air quality problems and ground-level ozone, exacerbate drought and wildfire risk, reduce labour productivity, damage infrastructure and reduce crop yields.\nThere are many ways to measure extreme heat. Absolute temperature is one, but a key factor for the impacts of heat extremes is also how much higher temperatures are compared to normal for a specific location.\nTo assess how the incidence of extreme heat has changed over time, Carbon Brief has examined which regions experienced all-time daily heat records in each year since 1950.\nThe analysis shows that the number of people experiencing all-time high heat events has increased dramatically over the past three decades. Overall, about half the world\u2019s population is living in regions that saw their hottest daily temperatures since 1950 during the past 10 years.\nIn 2022 alone \u2013 which was the fifth or sixth warmest year on record for the Earth\u2019s surface as a whole across different datasets \u2013 approximately 380 million people saw their hottest single hourly temperature ever recorded.\nIn the map below, the red shading indicates areas that saw their warmest daily temperatures since 1950 in 2022.\nAs you scroll, you will see the areas experiencing their warmest temperatures on record over the past two years (that is, 2021 and 2022) and all the way back to the past 10 years (2013-2022). Over the past decade, approximately 40% of the Earth\u2019s surface experienced its warmest temperatures on record.\nAreas experiencing record heat last year\nAreas experiencing record heat last year\nShare of world experiencing record heat\nShare of world experiencing record heat\nWhen scientists talk about record temperatures it can mean a number of different things. Often scientists focus on the hottest month or year on record for the Earth as a whole. This generally refers to the largest increase in temperatures relative to the historical average \u2013 known as the temperature \u201canomaly\u201d.\nAn alternative metric to look at the changing climate is how the hottest temperature recorded over the course of the year has changed over time. This only provides part of the story \u2013 there are real impacts of warming in other parts of the year \u2013 but is important in assessing extreme heat stress.\nIn this analysis, Carbon Brief uses ERA5 \u2013 a state-of-the-art reanalysis product from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) \u2013 to look at how the hottest maximum daily temperature of the year has changed over time for every part of the planet.\nIn essence, a reanalysis product is a weather model run backwards in time. To produce daily weather forecasts, groups such as ECMWF take into account massive amounts of data from satellites, aircraft, radar, weather balloons, weather stations and automated buoys. A reanalysis record creates these \u201cweather forecasts\u201d for each day backwards in time and can track changes in different data input sources to detect and correct for changes in the way that measurements are made over time.\nThe figure below shows the global average surface temperature from ERA5 for each day between 1950 and the end of 2022. While there is a lot of day-to-day variation in global temperatures \u2013 and even more in any individual part of the planet \u2013 the long-term warming trend is quite clear in the daily temperature data, with current temperatures around 1C warmer on average than those of the 1950s.\nWhile the world as a whole has warmed rapidly and experienced an increasing amount of record heat, people do not live in that global average.\nIn order to assess the number of people experiencing record heat, Carbon Brief combined the ERA5 all-time hottest temperature data with global population estimates from NASA and Columbia University.\nAs global population has increased over time, more people would be experiencing record heat events even if the climate were not changing \u2013 simply due to the fact that there are more people. To isolate the effect of climate change on the number of all-time record heat events the population is experiencing, the analysis holds the global population constant at 2020 levels and looks back in time at how many all-time record heat events would have been experienced if population remained unchanged.\nThe figure below shows the number of people who would have experienced all-time record heat events in each year if the global population remained fixed at 2020 levels.\nIf the climate were not warming, there would still be some year-to-year natural variability in the number of record heat events experienced, but the line would remain relatively flat. However, the world is warming and, thus, the portion of the population that has experienced all-time record heat has increased dramatically.\nAt the 2020 level of global population, approximately 6.3 billion people live in areas that have seen all-time record heat over the past 30 years \u2013 and 3.5 billion people have experienced all-time record heat in the past decade alone.\nDuring the past decade, a number of regions stand out as experiencing particularly widespread extreme heat events. The maps below overlay global population density data on top of areas experiencing record heat over the past decade, and zoom in on regions including Europe, China and the Caribbean to show large cities that set new all-time records in recent years.\nMany regio\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Often scientists focus on the hottest month or year on record for the Earth as a whole. This generally refers to the largest increase in temperatures relative to the historical average \u2013 known as the temperature \u201canomaly\u201d.\nAn alternative metric to look at the changing climate is how the hottest temperature recorded over the course of the year has changed over time. This only provides part of the story \u2013 there are real impacts of warming in other parts of the year \u2013 but is important in assessing extreme heat stress.\nIn this analysis, Carbon Brief uses ERA5 \u2013 a state-of-the-art reanalysis product from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) \u2013 to look at how the hottest maximum daily temperature of the year has changed over time for every part of the planet.\nIn essence, a reanalysis product is a weather model run backwards in time. To produce daily weather forecasts, groups such as ECMWF take into account massive amounts of data from satellites, aircraft, radar, weather balloons, weather stations and automated buoys. A reanalysis record creates these \u201cweather forecasts\u201d for each day backwards in time and can track changes in different data input sources to detect and correct for changes in the way that measurements are made over time.\nThe figure below shows the global average surface temperature from ERA5 for each day between 1950 and the end of 2022. While there is a lot of day-to-day variation in global temperatures \u2013 and even more in any individual part of the planet \u2013 the long-term warming trend is quite clear in the daily temperature data, with current temperatures around 1C warmer on average than those of the 1950s.\nWhile the world as a whole has warmed rapidly and experienced an increasing amount of record heat, people do not live in that global average.\nIn order to assess the number of people experiencing record heat, Carbon Brief combined the ERA5 all-time hottest temperature data with global population estimates from NASA and Columbia University.\nAs global population has increased over time, more people would be experiencing record heat events even if the climate were not changing \u2013 simply due to the fact that there are more people. To isolate the effect of climate change on the number of all-time record heat events the population is experiencing, the analysis holds the global population constant at 2020 levels and looks back in time at how many all-time record heat events would have been experienced if population remained unchanged.\nThe figure below shows the number of people who would have experienced all-time record heat events in each year if the global population remained fixed at 2020 levels.\nIf the climate were not warming, there would still be some year-to-year natural variability in the number of record heat events experienced, but the line would remain relatively flat. However, the world is warming and, thus, the portion of the population that has experienced all-time record heat has increased dramatically.\nAt the 2020 level of global population, approximately 6.3 billion people live in areas that have seen all-time record heat over the past 30 years \u2013 and 3.5 billion people have experienced all-time record heat in the past decade alone.\nDuring the past decade, a number of regions stand out as experiencing particularly widespread extreme heat events.

However, recent climate changes cannot be explained by natural causes alone.\nChanges in the earth\u2019s orbit and its axis of rotation have had a big impact on climate in the past. For example, the amount of summer sunshine on the Northern Hemisphere, which is affected by changes in the planet\u2019s orbit, appears to be the primary cause of past cycles of ice ages, in which the earth has experienced long periods of cold temperatures (ice ages), as well as shorter interglacial periods (periods between ice ages) of relatively warmer temperatures.1 At the coldest part of the last glacial period (or ice age), the average global temperature was about 11\u00b0F colder than it is today. At the peak of the last interglacial period, however, the average global temperature was at most 2\u00b0F warmer than it is today.2\nChanges in the sun\u2019s energy output can affect the intensity of the sunlight that reaches the earth\u2019s surface. While these changes can influence the earth\u2019s climate, solar variations have played little role in the climate changes observed in recent decades.3 Satellites have been measuring the amount of energy the earth receives from the sun since 1978. These measurements show no net increase in the sun\u2019s output, even as global surface temperatures have risen.4\nThe amount of sunlight that is absorbed or reflected by the planet depends on the earth\u2019s surface and atmosphere. Dark objects and surfaces, like the ocean, forests, and soil, tend to absorb more sunlight. Light-colored objects and surfaces, like snow and clouds, tend to reflect sunlight. About 70 percent of the sunlight that reaches the earth is absorbed.5 Natural changes in the earth\u2019s surface, like the melting of sea ice, have contributed to climate change in the past, often acting as feedbacks to other processes.\nVolcanoes have played a noticeable role in climate, and volcanic eruptions released large quantities of carbon dioxide in the distant past. Some explosive volcano eruptions can throw particles (e.g., SO2) into the upper atmosphere, where they can reflect enough sunlight back to space to cool the surface of the planet for several years.6 These particles are an example of cooling aerosols.\nVolcanic particles from a single eruption do not produce long-term climate change because they remain in the atmosphere for a much shorter time than greenhouse gases. In addition, human activities emit more than 100 times as much carbon dioxide as volcanoes each year.7\nOver the last several hundred thousand years, carbon dioxide levels varied in tandem with the glacial cycles. During warm interglacial periods, carbon dioxide levels were higher. During cool glacial periods, carbon dioxide levels were lower.8 The heating or cooling of the earth\u2019s surface and oceans can cause changes in the natural sources and sinks of these gases, and thus change greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.9 These changing concentrations have acted as a positive climate feedback, amplifying the temperature changes caused by long-term shifts in the earth\u2019s orbit.10\n1 National Academy of Sciences.

These events affect ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nNatural processes are always influencing the earth\u2019s climate and can explain climate changes prior to the Industrial Revolution in the 1700s. However, recent climate changes cannot be explained by natural causes alone.\nChanges in the earth\u2019s orbit and its axis of rotation have had a big impact on climate in the past. For example, the amount of summer sunshine on the Northern Hemisphere, which is affected by changes in the planet\u2019s orbit, appears to be the primary cause of past cycles of ice ages, in which the earth has experienced long periods of cold temperatures (ice ages), as well as shorter interglacial periods (periods between ice ages) of relatively warmer temperatures.1 At the coldest part of the last glacial period (or ice age), the average global temperature was about 11\u00b0F colder than it is today. At the peak of the last interglacial period, however, the average global temperature was at most 2\u00b0F warmer than it is today.2\nChanges in the sun\u2019s energy output can affect the intensity of the sunlight that reaches the earth\u2019s surface. While these changes can influence the earth\u2019s climate, solar variations have played little role in the climate changes observed in recent decades.3 Satellites have been measuring the amount of energy the earth receives from the sun since 1978. These measurements show no net increase in the sun\u2019s output, even as global surface temperatures have risen.4\nThe amount of sunlight that is absorbed or reflected by the planet depends on the earth\u2019s surface and atmosphere. Dark objects and surfaces, like the ocean, forests, and soil, tend to absorb more sunlight. Light-colored objects and surfaces, like snow and clouds, tend to reflect sunlight. About 70 percent of the sunlight that reaches the earth is absorbed.5 Natural changes in the earth\u2019s surface, like the melting of sea ice, have contributed to climate change in the past, often acting as feedbacks to other processes.\nVolcanoes have played a noticeable role in climate, and volcanic eruptions released large quantities of carbon dioxide in the distant past. Some explosive volcano eruptions can throw particles (e.g., SO2) into the upper atmosphere, where they can reflect enough sunlight back to space to cool the surface of the planet for several years.6 These particles are an example of cooling aerosols.\nVolcanic particles from a single eruption do not produce long-term climate change because they remain in the atmosphere for a much shorter time than greenhouse gases. In addition, human activities emit more than 100 times as much carbon dioxide as volcanoes each year.7\nOver the last several hundred thousand years, carbon dioxide levels varied in tandem with the glacial cycles. During warm interglacial periods, carbon dioxide levels were higher. During cool glacial periods, carbon dioxide levels were lower.8 The heating or cooling of the earth\u2019s surface and oceans can cause changes in the natural sources and sinks of these gases, and thus change greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.9 These changing concentrations have acted as a positive climate feedback, amplifying the temperature changes caused by long-term shifts in the earth\u2019s orbit.10\n1 National Academy of Sciences.

About 70 percent of the sunlight that reaches the earth is absorbed.5 Natural changes in the earth\u2019s surface, like the melting of sea ice, have contributed to climate change in the past, often acting as feedbacks to other processes.\nVolcanoes have played a noticeable role in climate, and volcanic eruptions released large quantities of carbon dioxide in the distant past. Some explosive volcano eruptions can throw particles (e.g., SO2) into the upper atmosphere, where they can reflect enough sunlight back to space to cool the surface of the planet for several years.6 These particles are an example of cooling aerosols.\nVolcanic particles from a single eruption do not produce long-term climate change because they remain in the atmosphere for a much shorter time than greenhouse gases. In addition, human activities emit more than 100 times as much carbon dioxide as volcanoes each year.7\nOver the last several hundred thousand years, carbon dioxide levels varied in tandem with the glacial cycles. During warm interglacial periods, carbon dioxide levels were higher. During cool glacial periods, carbon dioxide levels were lower.8 The heating or cooling of the earth\u2019s surface and oceans can cause changes in the natural sources and sinks of these gases, and thus change greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.9 These changing concentrations have acted as a positive climate feedback, amplifying the temperature changes caused by long-term shifts in the earth\u2019s orbit.10\n1 National Academy of Sciences.

However, recent climate changes cannot be explained by natural causes alone.\nChanges in the earth\u2019s orbit and its axis of rotation have had a big impact on climate in the past. For example, the amount of summer sunshine on the Northern Hemisphere, which is affected by changes in the planet\u2019s orbit, appears to be the primary cause of past cycles of ice ages, in which the earth has experienced long periods of cold temperatures (ice ages), as well as shorter interglacial periods (periods between ice ages) of relatively warmer temperatures.1 At the coldest part of the last glacial period (or ice age), the average global temperature was about 11\u00b0F colder than it is today. At the peak of the last interglacial period, however, the average global temperature was at most 2\u00b0F warmer than it is today.2\nChanges in the sun\u2019s energy output can affect the intensity of the sunlight that reaches the earth\u2019s surface. While these changes can influence the earth\u2019s climate, solar variations have played little role in the climate changes observed in recent decades.3 Satellites have been measuring the amount of energy the earth receives from the sun since 1978. These measurements show no net increase in the sun\u2019s output, even as global surface temperatures have risen.4\nThe amount of sunlight that is absorbed or reflected by the planet depends on the earth\u2019s surface and atmosphere. Dark objects and surfaces, like the ocean, forests, and soil, tend to absorb more sunlight. Light-colored objects and surfaces, like snow and clouds, tend to reflect sunlight.

These scientists were interested chiefly in the possibility that a lower level of carbon dioxide gas might explain the ice ages of the distant past. At the turn of the century, Svante Arrhenius calculated that emissions from human industry might someday bring a global warming. Other scientists dismissed his idea as faulty. In 1938, G.S. Callendar argued that the level of carbon dioxide was climbing and raising global temperature, but most scientists found his arguments implausible. It was almost by chance that a few researchers in the 1950s discovered that global warming truly was possible. In the early 1960s, C.D. Keeling measured the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere: it was rising fast. Researchers began to take an interest, struggling to understand how the level of carbon dioxide had changed in the past, and how the level was influenced by chemical and biological forces. By 2000, computer calculations along with evidence from ancient climates showed unequivocally that human emissions of the gas were raising Earth's temperature. Attention turned to studying how the gas was emitted or taken up by natural systems as well as by humanity, how far the temperature would rise, and what could be done to avoid disaster by curbing emissions.
