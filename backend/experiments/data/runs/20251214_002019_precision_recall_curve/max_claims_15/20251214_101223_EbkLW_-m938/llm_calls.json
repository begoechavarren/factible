The word democracy can refer to this same kind of representational government, or it can refer instead to what is also called a direct democracy, in which the citizens themselves participate in the act of governing directly.\nWhat is the basic meaning of democracy?\nThe word democracy most often refers to a form of government in which people choose leaders by voting.\nWhat is a democratic system of government?\nA democratic system of government is a form of government in which supreme power is vested in the people and exercised by them directly or indirectly through a system of representation usually involving periodic free elections.\nborrowed from Middle French democracie, democratie, borrowed from Late Latin d\u0113mocratia, borrowed from Greek d\u0113mokrat\u00eda, from d\u0113mo- DEMO- + -kratia -CRACY\n15th century, in the meaning defined at sense 1\n\u201cDemocracy.\u201d Merriam-Webster.com Dictionary, Merriam-Webster, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/democracy.

Novara, Historian, Manuscript Division, and Erika Hope Spencer, Reference Specialist, French Collections, Latin American, Caribbean, and European Division.\nEighty years ago, on April 21, 1944, France decreed that women would have the right to vote in postwar elections. At the time, France remained under German occupation and General Charles de Gaulle was leading a provisional government. World War II was drawing to a close and as other priorities took precedence, French women would not have an opportunity to go to the polls until April 1945. After more than 150 years of agitating for this fundamental right of citizenship, French women finally secured the vote. This victory came rather late, especially considering the promising proclamations of women such as Olympe de Gouges during the French Revolution of 1789.\nPhilosophers and politicians in France and America have participated in a lively exchange of ideas since the creation of our respective modern nations. The Library of Congress itself includes the personal library of one of the most adamant Francophiles, Thomas Jefferson. It stands to reason that the Library\u2019s collections reflect the rich exchanges between political and cultural figures. The Manuscript Division\u2019s women\u2019s suffrage collections are home to some fascinating documents tracing these dialogues between French and American suffragists. In celebration of the landmark decision granting women\u2019s suffrage in France, we are highlighting several French women who led the crusade for women\u2019s suffrage, all of whom are represented by papers, publications, and more at the Library of Congress.\nHubertine Auclert (1848-1914) was a leading French feminist, suffragist, and founder in 1876 of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 le droit des femmes (Rights of Women Society), which later became the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 le Suffrage des Femmes (Women\u2019s Suffrage Society) in 1883. Auclert believed in equal political rights for women and in militant tactics, including nonviolent public acts of civil disobedience. American suffragists Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton visited Europe in 1883 to begin organizing for women\u2019s rights on an international level. Auclert met Anthony in Paris in May 1883. Anthony noted in her diary that she \u201ccalled on M\u2019lle Hubertine Auclert \u2014 a bright young woman \u2014 editor of [the newspaper] \u201cLa Citoyenne\u201d \u2014 demanding suffrage for French women.\u201d The following year, Auclert sent a letter in support of the Washington Convention of the National Woman Suffrage Association. The grand purpose for Anthony and Stanton\u2019s European visit was to form the International Council of Women (ICW), which first met in Washington, D.C., in 1888, with attendees from nine countries and 53 women\u2019s organizations.\nAlthough Auclert had been inspired by the activism of French feminists L\u00e9on Richer (1824-1911) and Maria Deraismes (1828-1894), she had moved away from their more guarded and moderate feminism. Both Richer and Deraismes had founded important women\u2019s rights organizations as well. Richer established the Ligue Fran\u00e7aise pour le Droit des Femmes (French League for Women\u2019s Rights) and Deraismes formed the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour l \u2019Amelioration du Sort de la Femme et la Revindication de ses Droits (Society for the Improvement of the Plight of Woman and the Reclaiming of Her Rights). These two organizations thrived even after the deaths of their founders and claimed such adherents as Victor Hugo. Deraismes developed a friendship and corresponded with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, including sending her information about an international women\u2019s rights convention in Paris in 1889.\nJeanne Schmahl (1846-1915) was another French feminist with connections to the women\u2019s movement in the United States. Rather than directly support women\u2019s suffrage, Schmahl believed that other political rights, such as women\u2019s rights to their own wages, should be won first. Her interest in medicine, which she studied in Edinburgh and Paris, likely encouraged her friendship with Elizabeth Blackwell, the first woman to obtain a medical degree in the United States. Blackwell and her many reform-minded family members, supported women\u2019s rights and women\u2019s suffrage in the United States and in England. Schmahl exchanged letters and ideas with Blackwell in the 1890s, and they discussed many topics, including women\u2019s rights, public sanitation, domestic life, and her feminist journal, L\u2019Avant Courri\u00e8re (The Forerunner).\nFrustrated with the International Council of Women\u2019s refusal to support openly women\u2019s suffrage, American suffragist Carrie Chapman Catt, whose papers are in the Manuscript Division, founded the International Woman\u2019s Suffrage Alliance (IWSA) in 1904 with other international women\u2019s suffrage leaders. Although women had already won the vote nationally in the United States by 1920, many other women around the world, including women in France, still did not enjoy that right. In 1926, Catt continued to support international suffrage movements and joined other American women in attending the IWSA conference in Paris. The 1926 IWSA Paris conference proved to be a battleground for the leaders of women\u2019s organizations from the United States. Delegates from the U.S. League of Women Voters (LWV), led by Catt, and delegates from the National Woman\u2019s Party (NWP), led by equal rights advocate Alice Paul, had a history of disagreement over strategies and issues dating back to the American suffrage struggle. The LWV delegates convinced the IWSA to reject the NWP\u2019s application for membership, calling the NWP too radical and aggressive.\nThe NWP, not to be deterred from joining international networks, formed its own international organization, the International Advisory Committee (IAC). The IAC comprised members from eleven European nations, including Germaine Malaterre-Sellier (1889-1967), a World War I nurse and suffragist, as one of the representatives from France.

The principles of democracy serve as the bedrock for ensuring that citizens' rights and freedoms are protected while promoting equality, justice, and fair governance. Here are 14 principles that serve as a foundation for a democratic society. Adapted from the Civil Liberties Union for Europe 1. Participation of Citizens Democracy empowers the people to have a voice in shaping the course of their government and future. In direct democracies, this means citizens vote directly on the laws they live under. In a representative democracy, it means they have the opportunity to choose their representatives and freely express their opinions and desires. In either case, citizen participation is the foundation that makes democracy strong. Participation isn't just about voting on election day, although that's its most notable form. Equally important are public debate, town meetings, and peaceful protests, among other activities. Each form of participation helps keep people informed and ready to vote. Citizens\u2019 groups and civil society organizations play a crucial role in ensuring people can participate in these activities and should be supported to maximize participation. 2. Equality All individuals must be treated equally in a democracy. This means they are not discriminated against based on their ethnicity, religion, gender, or sexual orientation. It also means that people have equal access to the free enjoyment of their rights, such as equal access to the voting booth. When it comes time to vote, it means that every vote counts the same \u2013 your vote is just as valuable and counts just as much as the wealthiest or most powerful person in your country. That is the most basic element of equality in a democracy. 3. Accountability People entrust powers to those they elect, and they expect them to use those powers to benefit their communities. Politicians are accountable to the people, must act in accordance with their will, and have a duty not to abuse their power for personal gain or to enrich friends. When authoritarian governments take control of newspapers and news channels, and when they hinder and intimidate civil society groups, it becomes all too easy to hide corruption and abuses of power out of the public eye. This makes it harder for people to hold the government accountable on election day. 4. Transparency To make informed choices at the ballot box, voters need to know the facts. They must understand whether their government is making good decisions, if its policies are effective, whether it is following the rules, or if it is stealing public money. Transparency means government actions are open to the public, including the results and outcomes. Government information should, with few exceptions, be accessible to everyone upon request. Journalists and the public should be able to ask their politicians questions, and groups that promote transparency should be free to operate. Transparency is for Government, Privacy is for People. 5. Political Tolerance Although majority rule is central to democracy, this does not mean that the minority is overlooked. In a true democracy, the rights of all citizens are equal and must be respected regardless of who is in power. Even if their views do not win on election day, they still have the right to continue sharing those views with other citizens and the government. This is healthy, if not essential. Democracy thrives on openness and richness of thought; by suppressing the rights and freedoms of the minority, the majority hinders itself. 6. Multi-Party System Citizens must have a choice on election day. This means that more than one political party can freely participate in an election campaign and be an option for voters. When opposition parties do win, power is transferred and public debate about how to lead the country continues. If there is only a single party, it is most likely a dictatorship, though some countries have managed to build democratic systems under a single party rule. 7. Control Over the Abuse of Power Democracy can only survive if everyone participates \u2014 citizens through their support on voting day and throughout the year, and politicians by following the rules and working to improve everyone's lives. Abuse of power occurs when a government acts as if it's above the law, when politicians believe different rules apply to them, when the government favors only certain parts of society at the expense of others, or when public funds are misused by corrupt leaders and their allies. We often see this in the world\u2019s \u201cdemocracies.\" There are ways to protect democracy from these abuses, but no method can guarantee complete security. For instance, spreading power across different branches of government helps keep them accountable. Protecting free and fair elections is also essential. This includes safeguarding independent media so citizens can access reliable information before voting and ensuring election laws are fair to maintain the integrity of the process. 8. Freedom of Economy In a democracy, individuals should be free to choose their own paths in life. As long as they follow the rules, it\u2019s not the government\u2019s place to dictate what they should study, what job they should take, or what they should produce. Economic freedom is essential for building strong communities and a thriving national economy. 9. Bill of Rights Another way to protect people from government abuse of power is through a bill of rights. This is a list of the rights and freedoms people have, such as freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. As a bill, the document is part of the law, and many countries have enshrined it \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

In democracies, the people must take responsibility for their government, its actions, and its laws, because we are the people who put our political leaders in power. The personal responsibility to hold the government accountable is a benefit to all of society. John Locke said, \u201c\u2026by consenting with others to make one body politic under one government, puts himself [people] under the obligation to everyone in that society.\u201d In order to do this, the people must be aware of the role of government and the job it\u2019s supposed to fulfill. The citizenry must also be aware of when the government is overstepping, so it can check the government\u2019s power. For the United States, the rule of law that establishes the role and limitations of government can be found in the seven articles and twenty-seven amendments contained in the U.S. Constitution.\nAs a teacher, I encourage my students to not only read the U.S. Constitution, but also to have a deep, personal relationship to it. If students develop this relationship, they have the ability to understand the debate around what the different clauses in the Constitution mean. They can develop an informed position on the rights that are ensured to the people and they can challenge and discuss the variety of interpretations presented to them by politicians, media pundits, and other parts of society. It also helps my students realize that interpretations change over time and allows them to advocate for issues and causes they are passionate about through constitutional arguments. Most importantly, it teaches my students not to be controlled or overly influenced by people who provide interpretations of the Constitution to support a specific political agenda.\nAs students develop their relationship to the Constitution, they learn how to critically think and it empowers them to engage politically. Students learn that they have a voice and that there are multiple ways to engage in creating positive change. For example, students in my class recently debated the Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization Supreme Court case. To prepare for the debate, students read excerpts from Justice Alito\u2019s opinion justifying the reversal of Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. During the debate, students addressed the argument that Alito proposed in his ruling that abortion isn\u2019t explicitly included in the Constitution. As a result, Alito explains that if something isn\u2019t explicitly stated in the Constitution than it is left to the states to decide how to deal with the issue. In response, the students proposed the question, does this interpretation of the Constitution ignore amendment nine? After all, the citizens of the United States have \u201cenumerated rights\u201d that the government is equally responsible for protecting. Students proposed the idea that reproductive privacy could be an example of an \u201cenumerated right.\u201d Some of the students who agreed with this position began to directly communicate and lobby their legislators to propose and work to pass a law at the state and federal level that would protect the rights they felt were lost from the Dobbs ruling. Knowledge of the U.S. Constitution directly led to organized action by students.\nYou can\u2019t exercise your rights without knowing what they are. Often times, students feel disengaged and disenfranchised in politics because they can\u2019t vote and they feel like their voices aren\u2019t heard, but the example above empowered and prompted students to find a different avenue to express themselves. Studying the Constitution provides students with the information they need to participate in their political system even before they can vote. It describes what powers the different branches of the government hold and identifies who the students can lobby to see specific changes. It also provides them permission to be an advocate for issues they care about and to \u201cassemble\u201d in common interest to \u201cpetition\u201d the government. Through this engagement, students develop a sense of civic responsibility and become more interested in staying informed. As they pay more attention, they will become more vigilant to what the Supreme Court, Congress, and the President are doing. This will create a more accountable government through informed participation. If students continue to take this responsibility seriously, it will ensure that the needs of the people are met in an ever-changing world and their rights are protected.\nI have started to see this at my school. In this ever-changing world, students of this generation have identified mental health as a significant issue and they have started to demand that policy and lawmakers take this issue seriously. In the last few years, students at my school have lobbied school board members, state legislators, the Public Education Department, the Department of Health, and their House Representative for more resources to deal with the rising cases of depression, anxiety, and suicide. Through their advocacy, students have ensured funding for a wellness space on campus, a family therapist at school, and developed social emotional learning curriculum through an advisory period. As students become more aware of how to exercise their democratic liberties, they find they can accomplish amazing things.\nEric Chenoweth is director of the Institute for Democracy in Eastern Europe and principal author of Democracy Web, an online comparative study guide for teachers, students and civic activists.

(Photo Credit: Mo Peerbacus / Alamy Stock Photo)\nFreedom House has been a source of expertise on the state of global freedom and democratic trends since the Second World War. We have been tracking freedom around the world for more than 50 years, identifying emergent threats and, for the last 18 years, documenting the trend of ongoing decline in people\u2019s access to political rights and civil liberties. In 2024, we\u2019ve been paying close attention to this unusually active \u201cyear of global elections\u201d and how democracy is faring.\nBut amid all the talk about what is at stake for democracies across the globe, it struck us as worthwhile to step back and share a few words about what democracy is and why it\u2019s so important\u2014especially because authoritarian leaders so often seek to legitimize their regimes by falsely claiming that they are in fact democracies, or at least that they offer a variant form of democratic governance.\nOf course, scholars have written entire books about this topic, and there is hearty debate about what should and should not be included. For the purposes of this brief explainer, we\u2019ll try to stick to the basics, emphasizing the key benefits of democracy and why we think it must be defended.\nWhat is democracy?\nAt the most basic level, democracy means government by the people. Democracies have existed in every part of the world, with unique characteristics in every instance. Each democracy has its own rules and laws to guide it, and no two are the same. What democracies have in common are shared values and commitments to fundamental principles, as well as institutions that protect basic rights.\nThe core features that bind democratic societies together include:\nFree and fair elections, and a commitment to peaceful transfers of power: A hallmark of democracy is the idea that leaders are elected by the people in accordance with the law. Governments facilitate peaceful transfers of power, upholding the people\u2019s choice. Equal access to the vote, open competition among parties and candidates running for office, and adherence to the results of a free and fair election are all essential elements of democracy, because they demonstrate respect for the will of the people and reflect the ideal of a representative government.\nThe rule of law, an independent judiciary, and due process protections for all: The rule of law is the idea that people are governed primarily by a clear set of laws, enacted by duly elected representatives and applying equally to everyone. Respect for the rule of law and an independent judiciary to uphold it are core features of democracy. Democratic states strive to empower competent and independent judges who will interpret the law consistently. If individual judges or other officials err in their duties, there are appeals processes, civil society organizations, and other independent institutions to help address injustices. The rule of law and the protection of people\u2019s legal rights also require that those accused of crimes be afforded due process\u2014including the presumption of innocence, access to counsel, and the opportunity to present a defense. In an ideal democratic system, no one is above the law, and no one can be excluded from the protection of the law.\nThe separation of powers, with checks and balances: Democratic societies build the separation of powers into their systems so that one branch of government can check any overreach by another. Some democracies divide power among more governing institutions than others, but they all share an aversion to unfettered concentrations of power that may threaten people\u2019s liberties. Checks on power also come from outside the government, including from independent media and citizen groups that work for transparency and accountability. In authoritarian systems by contrast, power is deliberately centralized, civil society is restricted, and there are few if any safe ways to curb abuses by a repressive regime.\nA commitment to, and protections for, free and independent media: Although few government officials enjoy public criticism of their policies, democratic leaders recognize and protect the role that independent media play in a free society. Journalists hold powerful figures in government, business, academia, and elsewhere to account for their performance, and they provide information that people\u2014particularly voters\u2014need to make their own decisions. Leaders and governments that suppress free media often do so to prevent the exposure of their own failures and to engage in corruption, abuses, and power grabs without accountability.\nThe protection of fundamental human rights: Critically, democracies uphold the principle that all human beings are entitled to fundamental rights, including but not limited to the right to free expression, the right to associate and organize, the right to practice one\u2019s religious faith or nonbelief, and the right to privacy, to name just a few. Citizens in a democracy also have the right to participate in the election and administration of their own government. But no democratic government, however freely elected, has the authority to violate fundamental human rights, to which both citizens and noncitizens are entitled.\nWhy is defending democracy so important?\nDemocracy is the only system of government that holds leaders accountable to the people and protects their rights. While not perfect, it is the form of government that best enables people to live freely and with dignity, and that create\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The principles of democracy serve as the bedrock for ensuring that citizens' rights and freedoms are protected while promoting equality, justice, and fair governance. Here are 14 principles that serve as a foundation for a democratic society. Adapted from the Civil Liberties Union for Europe 1. Participation of Citizens Democracy empowers the people to have a voice in shaping the course of their government and future. In direct democracies, this means citizens vote directly on the laws they live under. In a representative democracy, it means they have the opportunity to choose their representatives and freely express their opinions and desires. In either case, citizen participation is the foundation that makes democracy strong. Participation isn't just about voting on election day, although that's its most notable form. Equally important are public debate, town meetings, and peaceful protests, among other activities. Each form of participation helps keep people informed and ready to vote. Citizens\u2019 groups and civil society organizations play a crucial role in ensuring people can participate in these activities and should be supported to maximize participation. 2. Equality All individuals must be treated equally in a democracy. This means they are not discriminated against based on their ethnicity, religion, gender, or sexual orientation. It also means that people have equal access to the free enjoyment of their rights, such as equal access to the voting booth. When it comes time to vote, it means that every vote counts the same \u2013 your vote is just as valuable and counts just as much as the wealthiest or most powerful person in your country. That is the most basic element of equality in a democracy. 3. Accountability People entrust powers to those they elect, and they expect them to use those powers to benefit their communities. Politicians are accountable to the people, must act in accordance with their will, and have a duty not to abuse their power for personal gain or to enrich friends. When authoritarian governments take control of newspapers and news channels, and when they hinder and intimidate civil society groups, it becomes all too easy to hide corruption and abuses of power out of the public eye. This makes it harder for people to hold the government accountable on election day. 4. Transparency To make informed choices at the ballot box, voters need to know the facts. They must understand whether their government is making good decisions, if its policies are effective, whether it is following the rules, or if it is stealing public money. Transparency means government actions are open to the public, including the results and outcomes. Government information should, with few exceptions, be accessible to everyone upon request. Journalists and the public should be able to ask their politicians questions, and groups that promote transparency should be free to operate. Transparency is for Government, Privacy is for People. 5. Political Tolerance Although majority rule is central to democracy, this does not mean that the minority is overlooked. In a true democracy, the rights of all citizens are equal and must be respected regardless of who is in power. Even if their views do not win on election day, they still have the right to continue sharing those views with other citizens and the government. This is healthy, if not essential. Democracy thrives on openness and richness of thought; by suppressing the rights and freedoms of the minority, the majority hinders itself. 6. Multi-Party System Citizens must have a choice on election day. This means that more than one political party can freely participate in an election campaign and be an option for voters. When opposition parties do win, power is transferred and public debate about how to lead the country continues. If there is only a single party, it is most likely a dictatorship, though some countries have managed to build democratic systems under a single party rule. 7. Control Over the Abuse of Power Democracy can only survive if everyone participates \u2014 citizens through their support on voting day and throughout the year, and politicians by following the rules and working to improve everyone's lives. Abuse of power occurs when a government acts as if it's above the law, when politicians believe different rules apply to them, when the government favors only certain parts of society at the expense of others, or when public funds are misused by corrupt leaders and their allies. We often see this in the world\u2019s \u201cdemocracies.\" There are ways to protect democracy from these abuses, but no method can guarantee complete security. For instance, spreading power across different branches of government helps keep them accountable. Protecting free and fair elections is also essential. This includes safeguarding independent media so citizens can access reliable information before voting and ensuring election laws are fair to maintain the integrity of the process. 8. Freedom of Economy In a democracy, individuals should be free to choose their own paths in life. As long as they follow the rules, it\u2019s not the government\u2019s place to dictate what they should study, what job they should take, or what they should produce. Economic freedom is essential for building strong communities and a thriving national economy. 9. Bill of Rights Another way to protect people from government abuse of power is through a bill of rights.

The UN supports democracy by promoting human rights, development, and peace and security.\n\nFull Page Content:\nDemocracy is a core value of the United Nations. The UN supports democracy by promoting human rights, development, and peace and security. In the 79 years since the UN Charter was signed, the UN has done more to support democracy around the world than any other global organization. The UN promotes good governance, monitors elections, supports civil society to strengthen democratic institutions and accountability, ensures self-determination in decolonized countries, and assists in the drafting of new constitutions in post-conflict nations.\nUnited Nations activities in support of democracy are carried out through the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Democracy Fund (UNDEF), the Department of Peace Operations (DPO), the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs (DPPA), the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR),and the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women), among others.\nWhen the founders of the United Nations drafted the United Nations Charter, they did not mention the word democracy. In 1945, many of the UN Member States did not endorse democracy as a system or didn\u2019t practice it. Yet, the opening words of the Charter, \u201cWe the Peoples\u201d, reflect the fundamental principle of democracy - that the will of the people is the source of legitimacy of sovereign states and, therefore, of the United Nations as a whole.\nThe UN does not advocate for a specific model of government but promotes democratic governance as a set of values and principles that should be followed for greater participation, equality, security and human development. Democracy provides an environment that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms, and in which the freely expressed will of people is exercised. People have a say in decisions and can hold decision-makers to account. Women and men have equal rights and all people are free from discrimination\nThese values are embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It projects the concept of democracy by stating \u201cthe will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government\u201d. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights develops them even further and lays down the legal basis for the principles of democracy in international law. It covers, for instance, freedom of expression, the right of peaceful assembly, and the right to freedom of association with others. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women stipulates that its 189 contracting parties shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that women can vote and stand for elections, and participate in public life and decision-making, including at the international level.\nSince 1988, the General Assembly has adopted at least one resolution annually dealing with some aspect of democracy. In 2015, world leaders committed in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to a world in which \u201cdemocracy, good governance and the rule of law as well as an enabling environment at national and international levels, are essential for sustainable development\u201d. The Agenda reaffirmed commitments that were made earlier at the World Summit in 2005 and in the Millennium Declaration.\nThe values of freedom, respect for human rights and the principle of holding periodic and genuine elections by universal suffrage are essential elements of democracy. In turn, democracy provides an environment for the protection and effective realization of human rights.\nFor several years, the UN General Assembly and the former Commission on Human Rights endeavoured to draw on international human rights instruments to promote a common understanding of the principles and values of democracy. As a result, in 2000, the Commission recommended a series of legislative, institutional and practical measures to consolidate democracy. Moreover, in 2002, the Commission declared the following as essential elements of democracy:\nSince its establishment in 2006, the Human Rights Council (successor to the Commission) has adopted several resolutions highlighting the interdependent and mutually reinforcing relationship between democracy and human rights. Recent examples include resolutions 19/36 and 28/14 on \u201cHuman rights, democracy and the rule of law\u201d.\nDemocracy deficits, weak institutions and poor governance impose persistent challenges. The UN Human Rights office (OHCHR) and UNDP address these challenges through their advisory services and programmes. In transitional democracies and countries emerging from conflict, OHCHR assists to build strong and independent judiciary systems, parliaments, human rights institutions, and vibrant civil societies. UNDP helps governments in strengthening their public institutions, to help countries fight corruption and support inclusive participation to ensure that no one is left behind. Every year, UNDP invests, on average, US$565 million to support inclusive governance and development at the local level.\nOHCHR collaborates with national governments and other actors to rebuild public confidence and restore peace and the rule of law in post-conflict nations and transitional democracies. UN Human Rights has actively supported transitional justice programmes in more than 20 countries around the world over the past 15 years. The office tries to ensure that human rights and transitional justice considerations are reflected in peace agreements and it supports the establishment of truth-seeking processes, judicial accountability mechanisms, and reparations programmes.\nOHCHR works to guide national and regional efforts and to facilitate the discussion on democracy and human rights. In 2012, the Human Rights Council adopted a resolution titled \u201cHuman rights, democracy and the rule of law,\u201d which reaffirmed that democracy, development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms were interdependent and mutually reinforcing. Further, OHCHR published a study on challenges, lessons \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Local officials have both a responsibility and a stake.\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of New York State.\nIf the American system of government is to function properly, citizens must actively participate in its operations at all levels, but especially at the local level. Local officials have both a responsibility and a stake in keeping citizens fully informed about local programs and activities and giving them clear opportunities to play meaningful roles in determining local public policy and in carrying it out.\nThe history, tradition, development and patterns of local government in New York State are based on a belief that a responsive and responsible citizenry will maintain a vigorous, informed and continuous participation in the processes of local government. A basic principle upon which New York local government, with its broad home rule authority, is constructed is that local community values can be fostered and served. Assuring meaningful participation by citizens in government at all levels in the face of the complexity of contemporary society is one of the great challenges of American democracy.\nThe individual citizen has numerous ways to influence government. Some of these, such as writing letters to public officials, joining interest groups and supporting lobbying efforts, are of a private nature. The structure of government itself, however, provides other avenues of a more formal character. These include applications of the electoral process through which citizens may express their interests and concerns, plus devices such as public hearings and open meetings of legislative bodies. All local officials have a basic duty to assure that citizens have ways to participate actively and meaningfully in local government affairs. Apart from making themselves accessible to their constituents, local officials can keep citizens informed about public affairs, and the citizens, in turn may express their will through the electoral process.\nAbroad base of participation in local government forms the foundation of our working democracy, and the electoral process is only one of many ways in which the individual citizen can make his or her views felt at the local level.\nAt the turn of the twentieth century, enlightened citizen groups recommended adoption of the short ballot along with several electoral reforms. They believed that a citizen could acquire more knowledge about candidates and issues and could therefore vote more intelligently if fewer offices appeared on the ballot. They argued further that the voter\u2019s basic concern lay with choosing officers who would make policy rather than filling jobs of an administrative or even clerical nature in which there was no decision-making authority. Despite some improvements during the past century, the length of a ballot still seems to depend on the proximity to the citizen of the governmental level \u2014 national, state and local. In the American three-branch system of government, the minimum ballot would include a chief executive (or two), one or more legislators, and perhaps judges. At the state level, the ballot may also include the offices of attorney general, state comptroller or auditor, and others. At the local level, the ballot grows to include such miscellaneous offices as town clerk, superintendent of highways and others.\nNew Yorkers, in their local elections, have to vote for officers to serve in two, three, or even more different local governments. A city resident will, for example, be voting for county and city and often school district officials. A village resident will be voting not only for village officials but also for county, town and school district officials. A resident of the town outside the area of the village may be voting in a fire district election as well as in county, town and school district elections. Although there are infinite variations, the most typical elected local officials appear in the following list.\nCounty\nexecutive (charter county only)\ncounty legislators(s) (except in counties retaining boards of supervisors)\ncounty clerk\ncounty treasurer\nCoroner[1]\ncomptroller\nsheriff\ndistrict attorney\ncounty judge\nfamily court judge\nsurrogate\nCity\nmayor\ncomptroller\ncouncil members\nmunicipal judges\nTown\nsupervisor\nboard members\njustices\ntown clerk\nsuperintendent of highways\nreceiver of taxes or tax collector\nassessors[2]\nVillage\nmayor\ntrustees\njustice(s)\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, many counties changed their governing body from a board of supervisors to a county legislature, with representation based on districts. In those counties, town residents have to vote for one or more county legislators in addition to the town supervisor, who formerly served ex officio as the town\u2019s representative on the county legislative body. Counties with county legislatures elect legislators from single or multi-member districts, or a combination of single and multi-member districts. Cities elect members of the city council at-large, or from wards or districts, or both at-large and from wards or districts. Towns elect members of the town board at-large, or from wards that have been established pursuant of Town Law section 81. A few villages operate on a ward system.\nElections in fire districts generally occur pursuant to the Town Law, and each fire district elects five commissioners and a treasurer at large. [special_purpose_units_of_government#special_purpose_units_of_government] discusses these officials in a greater detail.\nWith certain rare exceptions, all local school board members in New York are elected. The method of election varies from district to district. In all school districts that elect their board members, however, the citizens of the entire district elect all board members at large. The number of school board members prescribed by state law varies from one or three for common school districts to not more than nine for union free, central and city school districts (see [special_purpose_units_of_government#special_purpose_units_of_government] for a more complete discussion of school boards).

The principles of democracy serve as the bedrock for ensuring that citizens' rights and freedoms are protected while promoting equality, justice, and fair governance. Here are 14 principles that serve as a foundation for a democratic society. Adapted from the Civil Liberties Union for Europe 1. Participation of Citizens Democracy empowers the people to have a voice in shaping the course of their government and future. In direct democracies, this means citizens vote directly on the laws they live under. In a representative democracy, it means they have the opportunity to choose their representatives and freely express their opinions and desires. In either case, citizen participation is the foundation that makes democracy strong. Participation isn't just about voting on election day, although that's its most notable form. Equally important are public debate, town meetings, and peaceful protests, among other activities. Each form of participation helps keep people informed and ready to vote. Citizens\u2019 groups and civil society organizations play a crucial role in ensuring people can participate in these activities and should be supported to maximize participation. 2. Equality All individuals must be treated equally in a democracy. This means they are not discriminated against based on their ethnicity, religion, gender, or sexual orientation. It also means that people have equal access to the free enjoyment of their rights, such as equal access to the voting booth. When it comes time to vote, it means that every vote counts the same \u2013 your vote is just as valuable and counts just as much as the wealthiest or most powerful person in your country. That is the most basic element of equality in a democracy. 3. Accountability People entrust powers to those they elect, and they expect them to use those powers to benefit their communities. Politicians are accountable to the people, must act in accordance with their will, and have a duty not to abuse their power for personal gain or to enrich friends. When authoritarian governments take control of newspapers and news channels, and when they hinder and intimidate civil society groups, it becomes all too easy to hide corruption and abuses of power out of the public eye. This makes it harder for people to hold the government accountable on election day. 4. Transparency To make informed choices at the ballot box, voters need to know the facts. They must understand whether their government is making good decisions, if its policies are effective, whether it is following the rules, or if it is stealing public money. Transparency means government actions are open to the public, including the results and outcomes. Government information should, with few exceptions, be accessible to everyone upon request. Journalists and the public should be able to ask their politicians questions, and groups that promote transparency should be free to operate. Transparency is for Government, Privacy is for People. 5. Political Tolerance Although majority rule is central to democracy, this does not mean that the minority is overlooked. In a true democracy, the rights of all citizens are equal and must be respected regardless of who is in power. Even if their views do not win on election day, they still have the right to continue sharing those views with other citizens and the government. This is healthy, if not essential. Democracy thrives on openness and richness of thought; by suppressing the rights and freedoms of the minority, the majority hinders itself. 6. Multi-Party System Citizens must have a choice on election day. This means that more than one political party can freely participate in an election campaign and be an option for voters. When opposition parties do win, power is transferred and public debate about how to lead the country continues. If there is only a single party, it is most likely a dictatorship, though some countries have managed to build democratic systems under a single party rule. 7. Control Over the Abuse of Power Democracy can only survive if everyone participates \u2014 citizens through their support on voting day and throughout the year, and politicians by following the rules and working to improve everyone's lives. Abuse of power occurs when a government acts as if it's above the law, when politicians believe different rules apply to them, when the government favors only certain parts of society at the expense of others, or when public funds are misused by corrupt leaders and their allies. We often see this in the world\u2019s \u201cdemocracies.\" There are ways to protect democracy from these abuses, but no method can guarantee complete security. For instance, spreading power across different branches of government helps keep them accountable. Protecting free and fair elections is also essential. This includes safeguarding independent media so citizens can access reliable information before voting and ensuring election laws are fair to maintain the integrity of the process. 8. Freedom of Economy In a democracy, individuals should be free to choose their own paths in life. As long as they follow the rules, it\u2019s not the government\u2019s place to dictate what they should study, what job they should take, or what they should produce. Economic freedom is essential for building strong communities and a thriving national economy. 9. Bill of Rights Another way to protect people from government abuse of power is through a bill of rights. This is a list of the rights and freedoms people have, such as freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. As a bill, the document is part of the law, and many countries have enshrined it \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Accountability involves far more than the mere holding of regular national elections; it ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nIn this first Constitution Day 2022 Blog Series post, Guest author Sean Thomas, a Shanker Institute Civics Fellow and National Board Certified Teacher, encourages his students to develop a deep personal relationship with the U.S. Constitution because when students become aware of how to exercise their democratic liberties, they can accomplish amazing things.\nDemocracies work best when the citizens of a nation hold their government accountable. In democracies, the people must take responsibility for their government, its actions, and its laws, because we are the people who put our political leaders in power. The personal responsibility to hold the government accountable is a benefit to all of society. John Locke said, \u201c\u2026by consenting with others to make one body politic under one government, puts himself [people] under the obligation to everyone in that society.\u201d In order to do this, the people must be aware of the role of government and the job it\u2019s supposed to fulfill. The citizenry must also be aware of when the government is overstepping, so it can check the government\u2019s power. For the United States, the rule of law that establishes the role and limitations of government can be found in the seven articles and twenty-seven amendments contained in the U.S. Constitution.\nAs a teacher, I encourage my students to not only read the U.S. Constitution, but also to have a deep, personal relationship to it. If students develop this relationship, they have the ability to understand the debate around what the different clauses in the Constitution mean. They can develop an informed position on the rights that are ensured to the people and they can challenge and discuss the variety of interpretations presented to them by politicians, media pundits, and other parts of society. It also helps my students realize that interpretations change over time and allows them to advocate for issues and causes they are passionate about through constitutional arguments. Most importantly, it teaches my students not to be controlled or overly influenced by people who provide interpretations of the Constitution to support a specific political agenda.\nAs students develop their relationship to the Constitution, they learn how to critically think and it empowers them to engage politically. Students learn that they have a voice and that there are multiple ways to engage in creating positive change. For example, students in my class recently debated the Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization Supreme Court case. To prepare for the debate, students read excerpts from Justice Alito\u2019s opinion justifying the reversal of Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. During the debate, students addressed the argument that Alito proposed in his ruling that abortion isn\u2019t explicitly included in the Constitution. As a result, Alito explains that if something isn\u2019t explicitly stated in the Constitution than it is left to the states to decide how to deal with the issue. In response, the students proposed the question, does this interpretation of the Constitution ignore amendment nine? After all, the citizens of the United States have \u201cenumerated rights\u201d that the government is equally responsible for protecting. Students proposed the idea that reproductive privacy could be an example of an \u201cenumerated right.\u201d Some of the students who agreed with this position began to directly communicate and lobby their legislators to propose and work to pass a law at the state and federal level that would protect the rights they felt were lost from the Dobbs ruling. Knowledge of the U.S. Constitution directly led to organized action by students.\nYou can\u2019t exercise your rights without knowing what they are. Often times, students feel disengaged and disenfranchised in politics because they can\u2019t vote and they feel like their voices aren\u2019t heard, but the example above empowered and prompted students to find a different avenue to express themselves. Studying the Constitution provides students with the information they need to participate in their political system even before they can vote. It describes what powers the different branches of the government hold and identifies who the students can lobby to see specific changes. It also provides them permission to be an advocate for issues they care about and to \u201cassemble\u201d in common interest to \u201cpetition\u201d the government. Through this engagement, students develop a sense of civic responsibility and become more interested in staying informed. As they pay more attention, they will become more vigilant to what the Supreme Court, Congress, and the President are doing. This will create a more accountable government through informed participation. If students continue to take this responsibility seriously, it will ensure that the needs of the people are met in an ever-changing world and their rights are protected.\nI have started to see this at my school. In this ever-changing world, students of this generation have identified mental health as a significant issue and they have started to demand that policy and lawmakers take this issue seriously. In the last few years, students at my school have lobbied school board members, state legislators, the Public Education Department, the Department of Health, and their House Representative for more resources to deal with the rising cases of depression, anxiety, and suicide. Through their advocacy, students have ensured funding for a wellness space on campus, a family therapist at school, and developed social emotional learning curriculum through an advisory period.

In democracies, the people must take responsibility for their government, its actions, and its laws, because we are the people who put our political leaders in power. The personal responsibility to hold the government accountable is a benefit to all of society. John Locke said, \u201c\u2026by consenting with others to make one body politic under one government, puts himself [people] under the obligation to everyone in that society.\u201d In order to do this, the people must be aware of the role of government and the job it\u2019s supposed to fulfill. The citizenry must also be aware of when the government is overstepping, so it can check the government\u2019s power. For the United States, the rule of law that establishes the role and limitations of government can be found in the seven articles and twenty-seven amendments contained in the U.S. Constitution.\nAs a teacher, I encourage my students to not only read the U.S. Constitution, but also to have a deep, personal relationship to it. If students develop this relationship, they have the ability to understand the debate around what the different clauses in the Constitution mean. They can develop an informed position on the rights that are ensured to the people and they can challenge and discuss the variety of interpretations presented to them by politicians, media pundits, and other parts of society. It also helps my students realize that interpretations change over time and allows them to advocate for issues and causes they are passionate about through constitutional arguments. Most importantly, it teaches my students not to be controlled or overly influenced by people who provide interpretations of the Constitution to support a specific political agenda.\nAs students develop their relationship to the Constitution, they learn how to critically think and it empowers them to engage politically. Students learn that they have a voice and that there are multiple ways to engage in creating positive change. For example, students in my class recently debated the Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization Supreme Court case. To prepare for the debate, students read excerpts from Justice Alito\u2019s opinion justifying the reversal of Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. During the debate, students addressed the argument that Alito proposed in his ruling that abortion isn\u2019t explicitly included in the Constitution. As a result, Alito explains that if something isn\u2019t explicitly stated in the Constitution than it is left to the states to decide how to deal with the issue. In response, the students proposed the question, does this interpretation of the Constitution ignore amendment nine? After all, the citizens of the United States have \u201cenumerated rights\u201d that the government is equally responsible for protecting. Students proposed the idea that reproductive privacy could be an example of an \u201cenumerated right.\u201d Some of the students who agreed with this position began to directly communicate and lobby their legislators to propose and work to pass a law at the state and federal level that would protect the rights they felt were lost from the Dobbs ruling. Knowledge of the U.S. Constitution directly led to organized action by students.\nYou can\u2019t exercise your rights without knowing what they are. Often times, students feel disengaged and disenfranchised in politics because they can\u2019t vote and they feel like their voices aren\u2019t heard, but the example above empowered and prompted students to find a different avenue to express themselves. Studying the Constitution provides students with the information they need to participate in their political system even before they can vote. It describes what powers the different branches of the government hold and identifies who the students can lobby to see specific changes. It also provides them permission to be an advocate for issues they care about and to \u201cassemble\u201d in common interest to \u201cpetition\u201d the government. Through this engagement, students develop a sense of civic responsibility and become more interested in staying informed. As they pay more attention, they will become more vigilant to what the Supreme Court, Congress, and the President are doing. This will create a more accountable government through informed participation.

Many of the revolution's ideas are considered fundamental principles of liberal democracy,[1] and its values remain central to modern French political discourse.[2] It was caused by a combination of social, political, and economic factors which the existing regime proved unable to manage.\nFinancial crisis and widespread social distress led to the convocation of the Estates General in May 1789, its first meeting since 1614. The representatives of the Third Estate broke away and re-constituted themselves as a National Assembly in June. The Storming of the Bastille in Paris on 14 July led to a series of radical measures by the Assembly, including the abolition of feudalism, state control over the Catholic Church in France, and issuing the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.\nThe next three years were dominated by a struggle for political control. King Louis XVI's attempted flight to Varennes in June 1791 further discredited the monarchy, and military defeats after the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in April 1792 led to the insurrection of 10 August 1792. As a result, the monarchy was replaced by the French First Republic in September, followed by the execution of Louis XVI himself in January 1793.\nAfter another revolt in June 1793, the constitution was suspended, and political power passed from the National Convention to the Committee of Public Safety, dominated by radical Jacobins led by Maximilien Robespierre. About 16,000 people were sentenced by the Revolutionary Tribunal and executed in the Reign of Terror, which ended in July 1794 with the Thermidorian Reaction. Weakened by external threats and internal opposition, the Committee of Public Safety was replaced in November 1795 by the Directory. Its instability ended in 1799 with the coup of 18 Brumaire and the establishment of the Consulate, with Napoleon Bonaparte as First Consul.\nThe Revolution resulted from multiple long-term and short-term factors, culminating in a social, economic, financial and political crisis in the late 1780s.[3][4][5] Combined with resistance to reform by the ruling elite and indecisive policy by Louis XVI and his ministers, the result was a crisis the state was unable to manage.[6][7]\nBetween 1715 and 1789, the French population grew from 21 to 28 million, 20% of whom lived in towns or cities, Paris alone having over 600,000 inhabitants.[8] This was accompanied by a tripling in the size of the middle class, which comprised almost 10% of the population by 1789.[9] Despite increases in overall prosperity, its benefits were largely restricted to the rentier and mercantile classes, while the living standards fell for wage labourers and peasant farmers who rented their land.[10][11] Economic recession from 1785, combined with bad harvests in 1787 and 1788, led to high unemployment and food prices, causing a financial and political crisis.[3][12][13][14]\nWhile the state also experienced a debt crisis, the level of debt itself was not high compared with Britain's.[15] A significant problem was that tax rates varied widely from one region to another, were often different from the official amounts, and were collected inconsistently. The complexity and lack of accountability caused resentment among all taxpayers.[16][b] Attempts to simplify the system were blocked by the regional Parlements which approved financial policy. The resulting impasse led to the calling of the Estates General of 1789, which became radicalised by the struggle for control of public finances.[18]\nLouis XVI was willing to consider reforms, but he often backed down when faced with opposition from conservative elements within the nobility. Enlightenment critiques of social institutions were widely discussed among the educated French elite. At the same time, the American Revolution and the European revolts of the 1780s inspired public debate on issues such as patriotism, liberty, equality, and democracy. These shaped the response of the educated public to the crisis,[19] while scandals such as the Affair of the Diamond Necklace fuelled widespread anger at the court, nobility, and church officials.[20]\nFrance faced a series of budgetary crises during the 18th century as revenues failed to keep pace with expenditure.[21][22] Despite solid economic growth, the use of tax farmers meant this was not reflected in a proportional growth in state tax income.[21] As the nobility and Church benefited from a variety of exemptions, the tax burden fell mainly on the lower classes.[23] Reform was difficult because new tax laws had to be registered with regional judicial bodies or parlements that were able to block them. The king could impose laws by decree, but this risked open conflict with the parlements, the nobility, and those subject to new taxes.[24]\nFrance primarily used loans to fund the 1778 to 1783 Anglo-French War. Even after it ended, the monarchy continued to borrow heavily, and by 1788, half of state revenue went on servicing its debt.[25] In 1786, the French finance minister, Calonne, proposed reforms including a universal land tax, the abolition of grain controls and internal tariffs, and new provincial assemblies appointed by the king. The new taxes were rejected, first by a hand-picked Assembly of Notables dominated by the nobility, then by the parlements when submitted by Calonne's successor Brienne. The notables and parlements argued that the proposed taxes could only be approved by an Estates-General, a representative body that last met in 1614.[26]\nThe conflict between the Crown and the parlements became a national political crisis. Both sides issued a series of public statements, the government arguing that it was combating privilege, and the parlement defending the ancient rights of the nation. Public opinion was firmly on the side o\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The principles of democracy serve as the bedrock for ensuring that citizens' rights and freedoms are protected while promoting equality, justice, and fair governance. Here are 14 principles that serve as a foundation for a democratic society. Adapted from the Civil Liberties Union for Europe 1. Participation of Citizens Democracy empowers the people to have a voice in shaping the course of their government and future. In direct democracies, this means citizens vote directly on the laws they live under. In a representative democracy, it means they have the opportunity to choose their representatives and freely express their opinions and desires. In either case, citizen participation is the foundation that makes democracy strong. Participation isn't just about voting on election day, although that's its most notable form. Equally important are public debate, town meetings, and peaceful protests, among other activities. Each form of participation helps keep people informed and ready to vote. Citizens\u2019 groups and civil society organizations play a crucial role in ensuring people can participate in these activities and should be supported to maximize participation. 2. Equality All individuals must be treated equally in a democracy. This means they are not discriminated against based on their ethnicity, religion, gender, or sexual orientation. It also means that people have equal access to the free enjoyment of their rights, such as equal access to the voting booth. When it comes time to vote, it means that every vote counts the same \u2013 your vote is just as valuable and counts just as much as the wealthiest or most powerful person in your country. That is the most basic element of equality in a democracy. 3. Accountability People entrust powers to those they elect, and they expect them to use those powers to benefit their communities. Politicians are accountable to the people, must act in accordance with their will, and have a duty not to abuse their power for personal gain or to enrich friends. When authoritarian governments take control of newspapers and news channels, and when they hinder and intimidate civil society groups, it becomes all too easy to hide corruption and abuses of power out of the public eye. This makes it harder for people to hold the government accountable on election day. 4. Transparency To make informed choices at the ballot box, voters need to know the facts. They must understand whether their government is making good decisions, if its policies are effective, whether it is following the rules, or if it is stealing public money. Transparency means government actions are open to the public, including the results and outcomes. Government information should, with few exceptions, be accessible to everyone upon request. Journalists and the public should be able to ask their politicians questions, and groups that promote transparency should be free to operate. Transparency is for Government, Privacy is for People. 5. Political Tolerance Although majority rule is central to democracy, this does not mean that the minority is overlooked. In a true democracy, the rights of all citizens are equal and must be respected regardless of who is in power. Even if their views do not win on election day, they still have the right to continue sharing those views with other citizens and the government. This is healthy, if not essential. Democracy thrives on openness and richness of thought; by suppressing the rights and freedoms of the minority, the majority hinders itself. 6. Multi-Party System Citizens must have a choice on election day. This means that more than one political party can freely participate in an election campaign and be an option for voters. When opposition parties do win, power is transferred and public debate about how to lead the country continues. If there is only a single party, it is most likely a dictatorship, though some countries have managed to build democratic systems under a single party rule. 7. Control Over the Abuse of Power Democracy can only survive if everyone participates \u2014 citizens through their support on voting day and throughout the year, and politicians by following the rules and working to improve everyone's lives. Abuse of power occurs when a government acts as if it's above the law, when politicians believe different rules apply to them, when the government favors only certain parts of society at the expense of others, or when public funds are misused by corrupt leaders and their allies. We often see this in the world\u2019s \u201cdemocracies.\" There are ways to protect democracy from these abuses, but no method can guarantee complete security. For instance, spreading power across different branches of government helps keep them accountable. Protecting free and fair elections is also essential. This includes safeguarding independent media so citizens can access reliable information before voting and ensuring election laws are fair to maintain the integrity of the process. 8. Freedom of Economy In a democracy, individuals should be free to choose their own paths in life. As long as they follow the rules, it\u2019s not the government\u2019s place to dictate what they should study, what job they should take, or what they should produce. Economic freedom is essential for building strong communities and a thriving national economy. 9. Bill of Rights Another way to protect people from government abuse of power is through a bill of rights. This is a list of the rights and freedoms people have, such as freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. As a bill, the document is part of the law, and many countries have enshrined it \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

According to the OECD Trust ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of New York State.\nIf the American system of government is to function properly, citizens must actively participate in its operations at all levels, but especially at the local level. Local officials have both a responsibility and a stake in keeping citizens fully informed about local programs and activities and giving them clear opportunities to play meaningful roles in determining local public policy and in carrying it out.\nThe history, tradition, development and patterns of local government in New York State are based on a belief that a responsive and responsible citizenry will maintain a vigorous, informed and continuous participation in the processes of local government. A basic principle upon which New York local government, with its broad home rule authority, is constructed is that local community values can be fostered and served. Assuring meaningful participation by citizens in government at all levels in the face of the complexity of contemporary society is one of the great challenges of American democracy.\nThe individual citizen has numerous ways to influence government. Some of these, such as writing letters to public officials, joining interest groups and supporting lobbying efforts, are of a private nature. The structure of government itself, however, provides other avenues of a more formal character. These include applications of the electoral process through which citizens may express their interests and concerns, plus devices such as public hearings and open meetings of legislative bodies. All local officials have a basic duty to assure that citizens have ways to participate actively and meaningfully in local government affairs. Apart from making themselves accessible to their constituents, local officials can keep citizens informed about public affairs, and the citizens, in turn may express their will through the electoral process.\nAbroad base of participation in local government forms the foundation of our working democracy, and the electoral process is only one of many ways in which the individual citizen can make his or her views felt at the local level.\nAt the turn of the twentieth century, enlightened citizen groups recommended adoption of the short ballot along with several electoral reforms. They believed that a citizen could acquire more knowledge about candidates and issues and could therefore vote more intelligently if fewer offices appeared on the ballot. They argued further that the voter\u2019s basic concern lay with choosing officers who would make policy rather than filling jobs of an administrative or even clerical nature in which there was no decision-making authority. Despite some improvements during the past century, the length of a ballot still seems to depend on the proximity to the citizen of the governmental level \u2014 national, state and local. In the American three-branch system of government, the minimum ballot would include a chief executive (or two), one or more legislators, and perhaps judges. At the state level, the ballot may also include the offices of attorney general, state comptroller or auditor, and others. At the local level, the ballot grows to include such miscellaneous offices as town clerk, superintendent of highways and others.\nNew Yorkers, in their local elections, have to vote for officers to serve in two, three, or even more different local governments. A city resident will, for example, be voting for county and city and often school district officials. A village resident will be voting not only for village officials but also for county, town and school district officials. A resident of the town outside the area of the village may be voting in a fire district election as well as in county, town and school district elections. Although there are infinite variations, the most typical elected local officials appear in the following list.\nCounty\nexecutive (charter county only)\ncounty legislators(s) (except in counties retaining boards of supervisors)\ncounty clerk\ncounty treasurer\nCoroner[1]\ncomptroller\nsheriff\ndistrict attorney\ncounty judge\nfamily court judge\nsurrogate\nCity\nmayor\ncomptroller\ncouncil members\nmunicipal judges\nTown\nsupervisor\nboard members\njustices\ntown clerk\nsuperintendent of highways\nreceiver of taxes or tax collector\nassessors[2]\nVillage\nmayor\ntrustees\njustice(s)\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, many counties changed their governing body from a board of supervisors to a county legislature, with representation based on districts. In those counties, town residents have to vote for one or more county legislators in addition to the town supervisor, who formerly served ex officio as the town\u2019s representative on the county legislative body. Counties with county legislatures elect legislators from single or multi-member districts, or a combination of single and multi-member districts. Cities elect members of the city council at-large, or from wards or districts, or both at-large and from wards or districts. Towns elect members of the town board at-large, or from wards that have been established pursuant of Town Law section 81. A few villages operate on a ward system.\nElections in fire districts generally occur pursuant to the Town Law, and each fire district elects five commissioners and a treasurer at large. [special_purpose_units_of_government#special_purpose_units_of_government] discusses these officials in a greater detail.\nWith certain rare exceptions, all local school board members in New York are elected. The method of election varies from district to district. In all school districts that elect their board members, however, the citizens of the entire district elect all board members at large. The number of school board members prescribed by state law varies from one or three for common school districts to not more than nine for union free, central and city school districts (see [special_purpose_units_of_government#special_purpose_units_of_government] for a more complete discussion of school boards).

Without it, we can't ensure the government is serving the public interest or representing the will of ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nIn this first Constitution Day 2022 Blog Series post, Guest author Sean Thomas, a Shanker Institute Civics Fellow and National Board Certified Teacher, encourages his students to develop a deep personal relationship with the U.S. Constitution because when students become aware of how to exercise their democratic liberties, they can accomplish amazing things.\nDemocracies work best when the citizens of a nation hold their government accountable. In democracies, the people must take responsibility for their government, its actions, and its laws, because we are the people who put our political leaders in power. The personal responsibility to hold the government accountable is a benefit to all of society. John Locke said, \u201c\u2026by consenting with others to make one body politic under one government, puts himself [people] under the obligation to everyone in that society.\u201d In order to do this, the people must be aware of the role of government and the job it\u2019s supposed to fulfill. The citizenry must also be aware of when the government is overstepping, so it can check the government\u2019s power. For the United States, the rule of law that establishes the role and limitations of government can be found in the seven articles and twenty-seven amendments contained in the U.S. Constitution.\nAs a teacher, I encourage my students to not only read the U.S. Constitution, but also to have a deep, personal relationship to it. If students develop this relationship, they have the ability to understand the debate around what the different clauses in the Constitution mean. They can develop an informed position on the rights that are ensured to the people and they can challenge and discuss the variety of interpretations presented to them by politicians, media pundits, and other parts of society. It also helps my students realize that interpretations change over time and allows them to advocate for issues and causes they are passionate about through constitutional arguments. Most importantly, it teaches my students not to be controlled or overly influenced by people who provide interpretations of the Constitution to support a specific political agenda.\nAs students develop their relationship to the Constitution, they learn how to critically think and it empowers them to engage politically. Students learn that they have a voice and that there are multiple ways to engage in creating positive change. For example, students in my class recently debated the Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization Supreme Court case. To prepare for the debate, students read excerpts from Justice Alito\u2019s opinion justifying the reversal of Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. During the debate, students addressed the argument that Alito proposed in his ruling that abortion isn\u2019t explicitly included in the Constitution. As a result, Alito explains that if something isn\u2019t explicitly stated in the Constitution than it is left to the states to decide how to deal with the issue. In response, the students proposed the question, does this interpretation of the Constitution ignore amendment nine? After all, the citizens of the United States have \u201cenumerated rights\u201d that the government is equally responsible for protecting. Students proposed the idea that reproductive privacy could be an example of an \u201cenumerated right.\u201d Some of the students who agreed with this position began to directly communicate and lobby their legislators to propose and work to pass a law at the state and federal level that would protect the rights they felt were lost from the Dobbs ruling. Knowledge of the U.S. Constitution directly led to organized action by students.\nYou can\u2019t exercise your rights without knowing what they are. Often times, students feel disengaged and disenfranchised in politics because they can\u2019t vote and they feel like their voices aren\u2019t heard, but the example above empowered and prompted students to find a different avenue to express themselves. Studying the Constitution provides students with the information they need to participate in their political system even before they can vote. It describes what powers the different branches of the government hold and identifies who the students can lobby to see specific changes. It also provides them permission to be an advocate for issues they care about and to \u201cassemble\u201d in common interest to \u201cpetition\u201d the government. Through this engagement, students develop a sense of civic responsibility and become more interested in staying informed. As they pay more attention, they will become more vigilant to what the Supreme Court, Congress, and the President are doing. This will create a more accountable government through informed participation. If students continue to take this responsibility seriously, it will ensure that the needs of the people are met in an ever-changing world and their rights are protected.\nI have started to see this at my school. In this ever-changing world, students of this generation have identified mental health as a significant issue and they have started to demand that policy and lawmakers take this issue seriously. In the last few years, students at my school have lobbied school board members, state legislators, the Public Education Department, the Department of Health, and their House Representative for more resources to deal with the rising cases of depression, anxiety, and suicide. Through their advocacy, students have ensured funding for a wellness space on campus, a family therapist at school, and developed social emotional learning curriculum through an advisory period. As students become more aware of how to exercise their democratic liberties, they find they can accomplish amazing things.\nEric Chenoweth is director of the Institute for Democracy in Eastern Europe and principal author of Democracy Web, an online comparative study guide for teachers, students and civic activists.

The UN supports democracy by promoting human rights, development, and peace and security. In the 79 years since the UN Charter was signed, the UN has done more to support democracy around the world than any other global organization. The UN promotes good governance, monitors elections, supports civil society to strengthen democratic institutions and accountability, ensures self-determination in decolonized countries, and assists in the drafting of new constitutions in post-conflict nations.\nUnited Nations activities in support of democracy are carried out through the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Democracy Fund (UNDEF), the Department of Peace Operations (DPO), the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs (DPPA), the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR),and the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women), among others.\nWhen the founders of the United Nations drafted the United Nations Charter, they did not mention the word democracy. In 1945, many of the UN Member States did not endorse democracy as a system or didn\u2019t practice it. Yet, the opening words of the Charter, \u201cWe the Peoples\u201d, reflect the fundamental principle of democracy - that the will of the people is the source of legitimacy of sovereign states and, therefore, of the United Nations as a whole.\nThe UN does not advocate for a specific model of government but promotes democratic governance as a set of values and principles that should be followed for greater participation, equality, security and human development. Democracy provides an environment that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms, and in which the freely expressed will of people is exercised. People have a say in decisions and can hold decision-makers to account. Women and men have equal rights and all people are free from discrimination\nThese values are embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It projects the concept of democracy by stating \u201cthe will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government\u201d. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights develops them even further and lays down the legal basis for the principles of democracy in international law. It covers, for instance, freedom of expression, the right of peaceful assembly, and the right to freedom of association with others. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women stipulates that its 189 contracting parties shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that women can vote and stand for elections, and participate in public life and decision-making, including at the international level.\nSince 1988, the General Assembly has adopted at least one resolution annually dealing with some aspect of democracy. In 2015, world leaders committed in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to a world in which \u201cdemocracy, good governance and the rule of law as well as an enabling environment at national and international levels, are essential for sustainable development\u201d. The Agenda reaffirmed commitments that were made earlier at the World Summit in 2005 and in the Millennium Declaration.\nThe values of freedom, respect for human rights and the principle of holding periodic and genuine elections by universal suffrage are essential elements of democracy. In turn, democracy provides an environment for the protection and effective realization of human rights.\nFor several years, the UN General Assembly and the former Commission on Human Rights endeavoured to draw on international human rights instruments to promote a common understanding of the principles and values of democracy. As a result, in 2000, the Commission recommended a series of legislative, institutional and practical measures to consolidate democracy. Moreover, in 2002, the Commission declared the following as essential elements of democracy:\nSince its establishment in 2006, the Human Rights Council (successor to the Commission) has adopted several resolutions highlighting the interdependent and mutually reinforcing relationship between democracy and human rights. Recent examples include resolutions 19/36 and 28/14 on \u201cHuman rights, democracy and the rule of law\u201d.\nDemocracy deficits, weak institutions and poor governance impose persistent challenges. The UN Human Rights office (OHCHR) and UNDP address these challenges through their advisory services and programmes. In transitional democracies and countries emerging from conflict, OHCHR assists to build strong and independent judiciary systems, parliaments, human rights institutions, and vibrant civil societies. UNDP helps governments in strengthening their public institutions, to help countries fight corruption and support inclusive participation to ensure that no one is left behind. Every year, UNDP invests, on average, US$565 million to support inclusive governance and development at the local level.\nOHCHR collaborates with national governments and other actors to rebuild public confidence and restore peace and the rule of law in post-conflict nations and transitional democracies.

Strengthening the rule of law has to be approached not only by focusing on the application of norms and procedures. One must also emphasize its fundamental role in protecting rights and advancing inclusiveness, in this way framing the protection of rights within the broader discourse on human development.\nA common feature of both democracy and the rule of law is that a purely institutional approach does not say anything about actual outcomes of processes and procedures, even if the latter are formally correct. When addressing the rule of law and democracy nexus, a fundamental distinction has to be drawn between \"rule by law\", whereby law is an instrument of government and government is considered above the law, and \"rule of law\", which implies that everyone in society is bound by the law, including the government. Essentially, constitutional limits on power, a key feature of democracy, require adherence to the rule of law.\nAnother key dimension of the rule of law-democracy nexus is the recognition that building democracy and the rule of law may be convergent and mutually reinforcing processes whenever the rule of law is defined in broad, ends-based terms rather than in narrow, formal and exclusively procedural terms. The nexus is strong whenever the rule of law is conceived in its relationship with substantive outcomes, like justice and democratic governance. This distinction is often characterized by resorting to the opposition between \"thin\" and \"thick\" conceptions of the rule of law.\nFormal and substantive notions are certainly related and some scholars argue against a thin/thick dichotomy, suggesting that, in situations of social and political change, both formal and substantive features of the rule of law may be \"thinner\" or \"thicker\". However, in general terms, a focus on \"thin\" definitions places emphasis on the procedures through which rules are formulated and applied, whereas \"thick\" definitions aim to protect rights and frame it within broader human development discourse.\nA \"thick\" definition delineates positively the rule of law as incorporating such elements as a strong constitution, an effective electoral system, a commitment to gender equality, laws for the protection of minorities and other vulnerable groups and a strong civil society. The rule of law, defended by an independent judiciary, plays a crucial function by ensuring that civil and political rights and civil liberties are safe and that the equality and dignity of all citizens are not at risk. It also helps protect the effective performance of the various agencies of electoral, societal and horizontal accountability from potential obstructions and intimidation by powerful State actors.\nThis \"thick\" definition of the rule of law differs from \"thinner\" definitions that place emphasis on the procedures through which rules are formulated and applied. Examples of the tenets within a \"thick\" definition were provided by the then United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, in his 2004 reports on the rule of law. Mr. Annan stressed that, for the United Nations, the rule of law is:\n(...) a principle of governance in which all persons, institutions and entities, public and private, including the State itself, are accountable to laws that are publicly promulgated, equally enforced and independently adjudicated, and which are consistent with international human rights norms and standards. It requires as well measures to ensure adherence to the principles of supremacy of the law, equality before the law, accountability to the law, fairness in the application of the law, separation of powers, participation in decision-making, legal certainty, avoidance of arbitrariness, and procedural and legal transparency.2\nReferring to this definition in his 2009 Guidance Note on Democracy, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon added that the United Nations provides expertise and support to \"the development of legislation and the strengthening of, in particular, legislative, executive and judicial institutions under such principles to ensure that they have the capacity, resources and necessary independence to play their respective roles\".3\nOver the years, the United Nations has fostered the rule of law at the international level through the consolidation and development of an international framework of norms and standards, the establishment of international and hybrid courts and tribunals and non-judicial mechanisms. It has refined its framework for engagement in the rule of law sector at the national level through the provision of assistance in constitution making; the national legal framework; institutions of justice, governance, security and human rights; transitional justice; and the strengthening of civil society.4 The 2008 Guidance Note of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Approach to Rule of Law Assistance provided overarching principles and a framework for guiding United Nations rule of law activities at the national level. Furthermore, his 2009 Guidance Note on United Nations Assistance to Constitution-making Processes outlined the components of constitution-making processes and reco\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Essentially, constitutional limits on power, a key feature of democracy, require adherence to the rule of law.\nAnother key dimension of the rule of law-democracy nexus is the recognition that building democracy and the rule of law may be convergent and mutually reinforcing processes whenever the rule of law is defined in broad, ends-based terms rather than in narrow, formal and exclusively procedural terms. The nexus is strong whenever the rule of law is conceived in its relationship with substantive outcomes, like justice and democratic governance. This distinction is often characterized by resorting to the opposition between \"thin\" and \"thick\" conceptions of the rule of law.\nFormal and substantive notions are certainly related and some scholars argue against a thin/thick dichotomy, suggesting that, in situations of social and political change, both formal and substantive features of the rule of law may be \"thinner\" or \"thicker\". However, in general terms, a focus on \"thin\" definitions places emphasis on the procedures through which rules are formulated and applied, whereas \"thick\" definitions aim to protect rights and frame it within broader human development discourse.\nA \"thick\" definition delineates positively the rule of law as incorporating such elements as a strong constitution, an effective electoral system, a commitment to gender equality, laws for the protection of minorities and other vulnerable groups and a strong civil society. The rule of law, defended by an independent judiciary, plays a crucial function by ensuring that civil and political rights and civil liberties are safe and that the equality and dignity of all citizens are not at risk. It also helps protect the effective performance of the various agencies of electoral, societal and horizontal accountability from potential obstructions and intimidation by powerful State actors.\nThis \"thick\" definition of the rule of law differs from \"thinner\" definitions that place emphasis on the procedures through which rules are formulated and applied. Examples of the tenets within a \"thick\" definition were provided by the then United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, in his 2004 reports on the rule of law. Mr. Annan stressed that, for the United Nations, the rule of law is:\n(...) a principle of governance in which all persons, institutions and entities, public and private, including the State itself, are accountable to laws that are publicly promulgated, equally enforced and independently adjudicated, and which are consistent with international human rights norms and standards. It requires as well measures to ensure adherence to the principles of supremacy of the law, equality before the law, accountability to the law, fairness in the application of the law, separation of powers, participation in decision-making, legal certainty, avoidance of arbitrariness, and procedural and legal transparency.2\nReferring to this definition in his 2009 Guidance Note on Democracy, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon added that the United Nations provides expertise and support to \"the development of legislation and the strengthening of, in particular, legislative, executive and judicial institutions under such principles to ensure that they have the capacity, resources and necessary independence to play their respective roles\".3\nOver the years, the United Nations has fostered the rule of law at the international level through the consolidation and development of an international framework of norms and standards, the establishment of international and hybrid courts and tribunals and non-judicial mechanisms. It has refined its framework for engagement in the rule of law sector at the national level through the provision of assistance in constitution making; the national legal framework; institutions of justice, governance, security and human rights; transitional justice; and the strengthening of civil society.4 The 2008 Guidance Note of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Approach to Rule of Law Assistance provided overarching principles and a framework for guiding United Nations rule of law activities at the national level. Furthermore, his 2009 Guidance Note on United Nations Assistance to Constitution-making Processes outlined the components of constitution-making processes and reco\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Many of the revolution's ideas are considered fundamental principles of liberal democracy,[1] and its values remain central to modern French political discourse.[2] It was caused by a combination of social, political, and economic factors which the existing regime proved unable to manage.\nFinancial crisis and widespread social distress led to the convocation of the Estates General in May 1789, its first meeting since 1614. The representatives of the Third Estate broke away and re-constituted themselves as a National Assembly in June. The Storming of the Bastille in Paris on 14 July led to a series of radical measures by the Assembly, including the abolition of feudalism, state control over the Catholic Church in France, and issuing the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.\nThe next three years were dominated by a struggle for political control. King Louis XVI's attempted flight to Varennes in June 1791 further discredited the monarchy, and military defeats after the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in April 1792 led to the insurrection of 10 August 1792. As a result, the monarchy was replaced by the French First Republic in September, followed by the execution of Louis XVI himself in January 1793.\nAfter another revolt in June 1793, the constitution was suspended, and political power passed from the National Convention to the Committee of Public Safety, dominated by radical Jacobins led by Maximilien Robespierre. About 16,000 people were sentenced by the Revolutionary Tribunal and executed in the Reign of Terror, which ended in July 1794 with the Thermidorian Reaction. Weakened by external threats and internal opposition, the Committee of Public Safety was replaced in November 1795 by the Directory. Its instability ended in 1799 with the coup of 18 Brumaire and the establishment of the Consulate, with Napoleon Bonaparte as First Consul.\nThe Revolution resulted from multiple long-term and short-term factors, culminating in a social, economic, financial and political crisis in the late 1780s.[3][4][5] Combined with resistance to reform by the ruling elite and indecisive policy by Louis XVI and his ministers, the result was a crisis the state was unable to manage.[6][7]\nBetween 1715 and 1789, the French population grew from 21 to 28 million, 20% of whom lived in towns or cities, Paris alone having over 600,000 inhabitants.[8] This was accompanied by a tripling in the size of the middle class, which comprised almost 10% of the population by 1789.[9] Despite increases in overall prosperity, its benefits were largely restricted to the rentier and mercantile classes, while the living standards fell for wage labourers and peasant farmers who rented their land.[10][11] Economic recession from 1785, combined with bad harvests in 1787 and 1788, led to high unemployment and food prices, causing a financial and political crisis.[3][12][13][14]\nWhile the state also experienced a debt crisis, the level of debt itself was not high compared with Britain's.[15] A significant problem was that tax rates varied widely from one region to another, were often different from the official amounts, and were collected inconsistently. The complexity and lack of accountability caused resentment among all taxpayers.[16][b] Attempts to simplify the system were blocked by the regional Parlements which approved financial policy. The resulting impasse led to the calling of the Estates General of 1789, which became radicalised by the struggle for control of public finances.[18]\nLouis XVI was willing to consider reforms, but he often backed down when faced with opposition from conservative elements within the nobility. Enlightenment critiques of social institutions were widely discussed among the educated French elite. At the same time, the American Revolution and the European revolts of the 1780s inspired public debate on issues such as patriotism, liberty, equality, and democracy. These shaped the response of the educated public to the crisis,[19] while scandals such as the Affair of the Diamond Necklace fuelled widespread anger at the court, nobility, and church officials.[20]\nFrance faced a series of budgetary crises during the 18th century as revenues failed to keep pace with expenditure.[21][22] Despite solid economic growth, the use of tax farmers meant this was not reflected in a proportional growth in state tax income.[21] As the nobility and Church benefited from a variety of exemptions, the tax burden fell mainly on the lower classes.[23] Reform was difficult because new tax laws had to be registered with regional judicial bodies or parlements that were able to block them. The king could impose laws by decree, but this risked open conflict with the parlements, the nobility, and those subject to new taxes.[24]\nFrance primarily used loans to fund the 1778 to 1783 Anglo-French War. Even after it ended, the monarchy continued to borrow heavily, and by 1788, half of state revenue went on servicing its debt.[25] In 1786, the French finance minister, Calonne, proposed reforms including a universal land tax, the abolition of grain controls and internal tariffs, and new provincial assemblies appointed by the king. The new taxes were rejected, first by a hand-picked Assembly of Notables dominated by the nobility, then by the parlements when submitted by Calonne's successor Brienne. The notables and parlements argued that the proposed taxes could only be approved by an Estates-General, a representative body that last met in 1614.[26]\nThe conflict between the Crown and the parlements became a national political crisis. Both sides issued a series of public statements, the government arguing that it was combating privilege, and the parlement defending the ancient rights of the nation. Public opinion was firmly on the side o\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

They punctuated their actions with a now-world-famous chant, \u201cThis is what democracy looks like!\u201d\nSince then, other activists have taken up the phrase as a rallying cry for everything from protesting police brutality, most recently during demonstrations in response to the killing of George Floyd, to advocating for women\u2019s rights and blasting corporations. The line even found its way into a modernized production of Shakespeare\u2019s Julius Caesar in Central Park in 2017.\nBut what does democracy actually look like?\nYou won\u2019t find the answer just by looking to a familiar origin story about ancient Greece, notes David Stasavage, a professor in the Department of Politics, dean for the social sciences at NYU, and author of the newly released The Decline and Rise of Democracy: A Global History from Antiquity to Today.\nWhile this form of government dates back thousands of years and covers multiple continents, Stasavage\u2019s research shows that its contours are varied, with no two democracies looking exactly alike. Some lacked constitutions and even elections, Stasavage says, but nonetheless \u201cstill adhered to the principle that the people ought to hold some sort of power.\u201d\nQuestions about what a democracy can or should be are very much alive in the US today, amidst a pandemic that has tested faith in local, state, and federal government responses in what already would have been a contentious presidential election year. While many saw the suffering caused by COVID-19 as the result of a failure of an elected government to protect and serve its citizens, demonstrators this spring compared restrictions designed to halt the virus\u2019s spread to \u201ctyranny\u201d\u2014implying they were democracy\u2019s true defenders.\nMore globally, some historians, such as Michael Lind, have expressed concerns about democracy\u2019s viability, sounding alarm bells over its \u201cdecay\u201d in Western Europe and North America. But others, including Jill Lepore, have acknowledged that while the 21st century has seen a decline in the number of democracies, the concept has previously survived dire threats\u2014such as in the 1930s, when industrialized nations turned to fascism.\nHeading into the 2020 general election period, NYU News talked with Stasavage about where democracy has been, where it\u2019s headed, and why he remains cautiously optimistic about its survival\u2014provided we heed history\u2019s lessons.\nDid the Greeks actually \u201cinvent\u201d democracy?\nThe Greeks gave us the word demokratia, which in its literal sense means that the people have power. But they were not the only ones to come up with the idea. A great many human societies over time have ruled themselves with this basic notion in mind. From the woodlands of Northeastern America prior to European conquest to Ancient Mesopotamia to Precolonial Africa, many societies operated under the basic principle that those who ruled should seek consent from their people before making decisions. Even if these societies did not have elections or written constitutions, they still adhered to the principle that the people ought to hold some sort of power.\nI call this pattern early democracy, and it involved a very deep form of political participation for those who had the right to it.\nHow does the form of government we have in the United States compare to those earlier versions of democracy?\nThe United States was the first modern democracy. Modern democracy differs from early democracy in two important ways. The first involves the emphasis on election of leaders. Rather than oblige leaders to continually seek popular input, as was the case in early democracy, we elect them for a period of several years, then allow them to go about the business of governing, and finally decide whether to reelect them. The second difference is that with a broad suffrage, modern democracy extends the right of political participation to more people than was the case in most early democracies. Over time, as previously marginalized groups\u2014including African Americans, women, and those without property\u2014asserted their rights, modern democracy has come to mean the possibility of political participation for all adults. The potential downside of modern democracy, in the US and elsewhere, is that it offers a form of political participation that is broad but which risks not being very deep. Simply having the right to vote every few years may not be sufficient to satisfy people\u2019s need for participation.\nYou write that the nation\u2019s founders, despite their foresight in many areas, \u201cdid not solve the problem of distrust\u201d of government. What would they make of the current moment, when we find trust in government at a near-historic low?\nOne common fear expressed by the Antifederalists, who opposed ratifying the Constitution, was that in a republic covering such a vast territory, the great mass of the population would be too distant from the seat of power. They might be able to participate in elections every few years, but between those moments, they would lack any connection with government. The feared consequence of this problem of scale was that the people would begin to distrust government, while also being susceptible to 18th-century versions of fake news.\nIn Federalist 10, James Madison tried to downplay such fears, but a few short years after the ratification of the Constitution he would change his tune. He didn\u2019t shift to saying that small republics were actually better, but he did say that in a republic on the scale of the United States, constant investments needed to be made to keep the people informed of and connected with government. To achieve this Madison argued that there should be subsidies for newspaper delivery, and this was something that happened with the P\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Strengthening the rule of law has to be approached not only by focusing on the application of norms and procedures. One must also emphasize its fundamental role in protecting rights and advancing inclusiveness, in this way framing the protection of rights within the broader discourse on human development.\nA common feature of both democracy and the rule of law is that a purely institutional approach does not say anything about actual outcomes of processes and procedures, even if the latter are formally correct. When addressing the rule of law and democracy nexus, a fundamental distinction has to be drawn between \"rule by law\", whereby law is an instrument of government and government is considered above the law, and \"rule of law\", which implies that everyone in society is bound by the law, including the government. Essentially, constitutional limits on power, a key feature of democracy, require adherence to the rule of law.\nAnother key dimension of the rule of law-democracy nexus is the recognition that building democracy and the rule of law may be convergent and mutually reinforcing processes whenever the rule of law is defined in broad, ends-based terms rather than in narrow, formal and exclusively procedural terms. The nexus is strong whenever the rule of law is conceived in its relationship with substantive outcomes, like justice and democratic governance. This distinction is often characterized by resorting to the opposition between \"thin\" and \"thick\" conceptions of the rule of law.\nFormal and substantive notions are certainly related and some scholars argue against a thin/thick dichotomy, suggesting that, in situations of social and political change, both formal and substantive features of the rule of law may be \"thinner\" or \"thicker\". However, in general terms, a focus on \"thin\" definitions places emphasis on the procedures through which rules are formulated and applied, whereas \"thick\" definitions aim to protect rights and frame it within broader human development discourse.\nA \"thick\" definition delineates positively the rule of law as incorporating such elements as a strong constitution, an effective electoral system, a commitment to gender equality, laws for the protection of minorities and other vulnerable groups and a strong civil society. The rule of law, defended by an independent judiciary, plays a crucial function by ensuring that civil and political rights and civil liberties are safe and that the equality and dignity of all citizens are not at risk. It also helps protect the effective performance of the various agencies of electoral, societal and horizontal accountability from potential obstructions and intimidation by powerful State actors.\nThis \"thick\" definition of the rule of law differs from \"thinner\" definitions that place emphasis on the procedures through which rules are formulated and applied. Examples of the tenets within a \"thick\" definition were provided by the then United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, in his 2004 reports on the rule of law. Mr. Annan stressed that, for the United Nations, the rule of law is:\n(...) a principle of governance in which all persons, institutions and entities, public and private, including the State itself, are accountable to laws that are publicly promulgated, equally enforced and independently adjudicated, and which are consistent with international human rights norms and standards. It requires as well measures to ensure adherence to the principles of supremacy of the law, equality before the law, accountability to the law, fairness in the application of the law, separation of powers, participation in decision-making, legal certainty, avoidance of arbitrariness, and procedural and legal transparency.2\nReferring to this definition in his 2009 Guidance Note on Democracy, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon added that the United Nations provides expertise and support to \"the development of legislation and the strengthening of, in particular, legislative, executive and judicial institutions under such principles to ensure that they have the capacity, resources and necessary independence to play their respective roles\".3\nOver the years, the United Nations has fostered the rule of law at the international level through the consolidation and development of an international framework of norms and standards, the establishment of international and hybrid courts and tribunals and non-judicial mechanisms.

Now, after a period of bipartisan efforts to expand enfranchisement, Americans once again face new obstacles to voting\nChallenges to voting rights in this country are hardly a 21st-century invention. Entrenched groups have long tried to keep the vote out of the hands of the less powerful. Indeed, the United States began its great democratic experiment in the late 1700s by granting the right to vote to a narrow subset of society \u2014 white male landowners. Even as barriers to voting began receding in the ensuing decades, many Southern states erected new ones, such as poll taxes and literacy tests, aimed at keeping the vote out of the hands of African American men and other targeted groups. Over time, voting rights became a bipartisan priority as people worked at all levels to enact constitutional amendments and laws expanding access to the vote based on race and ethnicity, gender, disability, age, and other factors. The landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965 took major steps to curtail voter suppression. Thus began a new era of push-and-pull on voting rights, with the voting age reduced to 18 from 21 and the enshrinement of voting protections for language minorities and people with disabilities. Greater voter enfranchisement was met with fresh resistance in 2013, when the U.S. Supreme Court undermined the Voting Rights Act in its ruling on Shelby County v. Holder, paving the way for states and jurisdictions with a history of voter suppression to enact restrictive voter identification laws. In the years after the ruling, states passed a slew of new restrictions on voting, including new voter ID laws, limits on early voting, and the closure of thousands of polling places nationwide. These activities have a demonstrable and disproportionate effect on populations that are already underrepresented at the polls. Adding to the problems, government at all levels has largely failed to make the necessary investments in elections (from technology to poll-worker training) to ensure the integrity and efficiency of the system.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Women's status in the family, society, and politics had long been a subject of polemics. In the eighteenth century, those who favored improving the status of women insisted primarily on women's right to an education (rather than on the right to vote, for instance, which few men enjoyed). The writers of the Enlightenment most often took a traditional stance on \"the women question\"; they viewed women as biologically and therefore socially different from men, destined to play domestic roles inside the family rather than public, political ones. Among the many writers of the Enlightenment, Jean-Jacques Rousseau published the most influential works on the subject of women's role in society. In his book Emile, he described his vision of an ideal education for women. Women should take an active role in the family, Rousseau insisted, by breast-feeding and educating their children, but they should not venture to take active positions outside the home. Rousseau's writings on education electrified his audience, both male and female.

Women's status in the family, society, and politics had long been a subject of polemics. In the eighteenth century, those who favored improving the status of women insisted primarily on women's right to an education (rather than on the right to vote, for instance, which few men enjoyed). The writers of the Enlightenment most often took a traditional stance on \"the women question\"; they viewed women as biologically and therefore socially different from men, destined to play domestic roles inside the family rather than public, political ones. Among the many writers of the Enlightenment, Jean-Jacques Rousseau published the most influential works on the subject of women's role in society. In his book Emile, he described his vision of an ideal education for women. Women should take an active role in the family, Rousseau insisted, by breast-feeding and educating their children, but they should not venture to take active positions outside the home. Rousseau's writings on education electrified his audience, both male and female. He advocated greater independence and autonomy for male children and emphasized the importance of mothers in bringing up children. But many women objected to his insistence that women did not need serious intellectual preparation for life. Some women took their pleas for education into the press.\nBefore 1789 such ideas fell on deaf ears; the issue of women's rights, unlike the rights of Protestants, Jews, and blacks, did not lead to essay contests, official commissions, or Enlightenment-inspired clubs under the monarchy. In part, this lack of interest followed from the fact that women were not considered a persecuted group like Calvinists, Jews, or slaves.\nAlthough women's property rights and financial independence met with many restrictions under French law and custom, most men and women agreed with Rousseau and other Enlightenment thinkers that women belonged in the private sphere of the home and therefore had no role to play in public affairs. Most of France's female population worked as peasants, shopkeepers, laundresses, and the like, yet women were defined primarily by their sex (and relationship in marriage) and not by their own occupations.\nVanguard of Women Going to Versailles\nTo Versailles, To Versailles!\nThe question of women's rights thus trailed behind in the agitation for human rights in the eighteenth century. But like all the other questions of rights, it would get an enormous boost during the Revolution. When Louis XVI agreed to convoke a meeting of the Estates-General for May 1789 to discuss the financial problems of the country, he unleashed a torrent of public discussion. The Estates-General had not met since 1614, and its convocation heightened everyone's expectations for reform. The King invited the three estates\u2014the clergy, the nobility, and the Third Estate (made up of everyone who was not a noble or a cleric)\u2014to elect deputies through an elaborate, multilayered electoral process and to draw up lists of their grievances. At every stage of the electoral process, participants (mainly men but with a few females here and there at the parish level meetings) devoted considerable time and political negotiation to the composition of these lists of grievances. Since the King had not invited women to meet as women to draft their grievances or name delegates, a few took matters into their own hands and sent him petitions outlining their concerns. The modesty of most of these complaints and demands demonstrates the depth of the prejudice against women's separate political activity. Women could ask for better education and protection of their property rights, but even the most politically vociferous among them did not yet demand full civil and political rights.\nAfter the fall of the Bastille on 14 July 1789, politics became the order of the day. The attack on the Bastille showed how popular political intervention could change the course of events. When the people of Paris rose up, armed themselves, and assaulted the royal fortress-prison in the center of Paris, they scuttled any royal or aristocratic plans to stop the Revolution in its tracks by arresting the deputies or closing the new National Assembly. In October 1789 the Revolution seemed to hang in the balance once again. In the midst of a continuing shortage of bread, rumors circulated that the royal guards at Versailles, the palace where the King and his family resided, had trampled on the revolutionary colors (red, white, and blue) and plotted counterrevolution. In response, a crowd of women in Paris gathered to march to Versailles to demand an accounting from the King. They trudged the twelve miles from Paris in the rain, arriving soaked and tired. At the end of the day and during the night, the women were joined by thousands of men who had marched from Paris to join them. The next day the crowd grew more turbulent and eventually broke into the royal apartments, killing two of the King's bodyguards. To prevent further bloodshed, the King agreed to move his family back to Paris.\nMemorable Day at Versailles, 5 October 1789\nWomen's participation was not confined to rioting and demonstrating. Women began to attend meetings of political clubs, and both men and women soon agitated for the guarantee of women's rights. In July 1790 a leading intellectual and aristocrat, Marie-Jean Caritat, Marquis de Condorcet, published a newspaper article in support of full political rights for women. It caused a sensation. In it he argued that France's millions of women should enjoy equal political rights with men. A small band of proponents of women's rights soon took shape in the circles around Condorcet. They met in a group called the Cercle Social (social circle), which launched a campaign for women's rights in 1790\u201391. One of their most\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Next was the abolition of slavery and the death penalty for political crimes, the repeal of the censorship act of 1835, the creation of new social measures for workers, and the establishment of male universal suffrage by decree on 5 March 1848.\nAll French men aged 21 or over could take part in the elections of the 900 deputies responsible for drawing up the constitution. On 23 and 24 April 1848, 84% of registered voters went to the polling places.\nAround 500 liberal republicans close to the provisional government were elected, including Lamartine; there were 150 radical and socialist republicans, including Victor Hugo, and 250 monarchists.\nThe resulting constitution was a mix of different constitutional traditions, which combined the ideas of 1789 with a more conservative spirit: the republican principles of \u201cLiberty, Equality and Fraternity\u201d were then based on \u201cFamily, Work, Ownership and Order\u201d. The text ensured the social gains of the provisional government would be lasting, affirmed the right to education, ownership, and freedom of expression and of association.

Even in the case of men, who were invariably enfranchised before women, the recognition of universal male suffrage was far more problematic than is often realized, though much has been written about it. In fact, the belief that the franchise should be awarded on the basis of certain criteria, such as property ownership or tax payment, as opposed to constituting a right of citizenship, was widely accepted during the nineteenth century, in France as elsewhere. Universal manhood suffrage was proclaimed in the French Constitution of 1793, but not implemented, and its later foundation in 1848 was unanticipated. There were also periods of reversal as well as progress, with moments of disenfranchisement, notably under the restored monarchy after 1814, but also during the First and Second Republics. Even in the early 1870s, the principle of one man, one vote was still being challenged by conservatives and its consolidation under the Third Republic was by no means preordained; it had taken nearly a century to achieve.\nFlexible purchasing options\nOxford University Press is a department of the University of Oxford.
