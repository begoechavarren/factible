    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nIf, for the same work, women make only 77 cents for every dollar a man makes, why don\u2019t businesses hire only women? Wages are the biggest expense for most businesses. So, hiring only women would reduce costs by nearly a quarter \u2013 and that would go right to the bottom line. Don\u2019t businesses want to be profitable? Or, are they just really bad at math? Well, actually, it\u2019s the feminists, celebrities and politicians spreading this wage gap myth who have the math problem. Here\u2019s why: The 77-cents-on-the-dollar statistic is calculated by dividing the median earnings of all women working full-time by the median earnings of all men working full-time. In other words, if the average income of all men is, say, 40,000 dollars a year, and the average annual income of all women is, say, 30,800 dollars, that would mean that women earn 77 cents for every dollar a man earns. 30,800 divided by 40,000 equals .77. But these calculations don\u2019t reveal a gender wage injustice because it doesn\u2019t take into account occupation, position, education or hours worked per week. Even a study by the American Association of University Women, a feminist organization, shows that the actual wage gap shrinks to only 6.6 cents when you factor in different choices men and women make. And the key word here is \u201cchoice.\u201d The small wage gap that does exist has nothing to do with paying women less, let alone with sexism; it has to do with differences in individual career choices that men and women make. In 2009, the U.S. Department of Labor released a paper that examined more than 50 peer-reviewed studies and concluded that the oft-cited 23 percent wage gap \u201cmay be almost entirely the result of individual choices being made by both male and female workers.\u201d Well, let\u2019s look at some of those choices. Georgetown University compiled a list of the five best-paying college majors, and the percentage of men or women majoring in those fields: Number 1 best-paying major: Petroleum Engineering: 87% male Number 2: Pharmaceutical Sciences: 48% male 3: Mathematics and Computer Science: 67% male 4: Aerospace Engineering: 88% male 5: Chemical Engineering: 72% male Notice that women out-represent men in only one of the five top-paying majors \u2013 by only a few percentage points. Now consider the same study\u2019s list of the five worst paying college majors: Number 1: Counseling and Psychology: 74% female Number 2: Early Childhood Education: 97% female 3: Theology and Religious Vocations: 66% male 4: Human Services and Community Organization: 81% female 5: Social Work: 88% female Here, it\u2019s the women who lead in all but one category. Even within the same profession, men and women make different career choices that impact how much money they make. Take nursing, where male nurses on the whole earn 18% more than female nurses. The reason? Male nurses gravitate to the best-paying nursing specialties, they work longer hours, and disproportionately find jobs in cities with the highest compensation. Now, here\u2019s how one expert on nursing compensation, Professor Linda Aiken of the University of Pennsylvania, sums up the data: \u201cCareer choices and educational differences explain most, if not all, the gender gap in nursing.\u201d The Department of Labor paper concluded that once these differences are accounted for across all professions, the unexplained wage gap is somewhere between 4.8 and 7 percent \u2013 almost identical to the 6.6 percentage gap found by the AAUW. But why is there any gap at all? No one knows for sure, as both the AAUW and the Labor Department concede. There are so many variables that drive wages that no single study can cover them all. Few wage gap studies control for variables such as dangerous work environment; men are vastly overrepresented, for example, on oil rigs. And here\u2019s another variable: men are more willing and able to work long hours without advance notice. According to Harvard economist Claudia Goldin, even if two lawyers have the same education, same specialty, and work the same number of hours \u2014 firms pay more to someone who is willing to always be \u201con call\u201d and ready to be in the office when the firm needs them, as opposed to wanting a more regular schedule. This isn\u2019t sexism, it\u2019s just common sense. With more realistic categories and definitions, whatever wage gap remains would certainly narrow to point of vanishing. So it seems that business leaders aren\u2019t bad at math simply because they don\u2019t only hire women. Those who claim that for the same work women earn 77 cents on the dollar compared to men, on the other hand, are not merely bad at math --but at telling the truth.

What can we do to reverse this trend? How can we work together to improve the health and well-being of women and their children, entire communities and the overall economy? When women have opportunities, such as a fair chance for education, employment, and earnings, they are more likely to live longer and healthier lives. Their children are also more likely to fare better.\nFor the nation\u2019s women who work outside the home, decades of economic insecurity and pay inequity were made worse by the pandemic. On average, women in the U.S. earn little more than 80 cents for every dollar white men make. The gap exists in nearly every county across the country but is at its widest in rural areas where women earn 77 cents, on average, for every dollar men make. Women also earn less than men for similar work in Southern and Western Plains states.\nIf trends of the last 35 years continue, it would take decades longer for women living in rural areas to receive equal pay for comparable work. For all regions of the country, by the earliest estimates, it would take white women until 2069 to earn what white men make, Black and Indigenous women until 2369 and Hispanic women until 2451, according to the American Association of University Women.\n\u201cThe biggest myth that the general population has about the gender wage gap is that it\u2019s getting a lot better,\u201d said Dr. Jessamyn Schaller, an economics professor at Claremont McKenna College. \u201cThere is definitely still a substantial gender wage gap.\u201d\nThe earnings lost as a result of the pay gap have meant women have had fewer opportunities to make ends meet, let alone save for emergencies or retirement.\nRacial and gender discrimination have contributed to a system that has long undervalued and underpaid women. Biases exist at all stages of employment \u2014 from hiring and performance reviews to layoffs. The pandemic exposed the barriers that have prevented women and caregivers from participating in the workforce. A lack of supports \u2014 such as paid sick leave and family leave \u2014 and high child care costs placed additional burdens on women. This was especially true for those with low incomes and women of color \u2013 the two groups least likely to receive employer-provided benefits.\nThe gaps remain despite women\u2019s educational gains; women have made up the majority of the college-educated population for more than 40 years. In addition, women have been segregated into lower-paying sectors such as service, education and health care. Yet even in these industries, men earn more than women for equal work. The wage gap widens as women attain higher levels of education and advance to more senior positions.\nSeveral factors influence the differences seen in wages across the country. The types of jobs available are often limited in rural areas. Cultural norms in some areas also dictate the fields women enter and the prevalence of gender discrimination.\nMost women face some barriers based on their gender regardless of their location. Yet women of\ncolor experience wage gaps wider than their gender or race would explain individually.\n\u201cBeing a woman of color is worse than a double whammy when it comes to pay inequality,\u201d said Dr. Jessica Milli, an economist who studies the gender pay gap. \u201cThis means that the labor market might be discriminating against women of color in very specific ways. That there are systemic barriers that they face in advancing in the workplace that are unique to their identities as women of color.\u201d\nPeople experience bias and discrimination differently based on the combination of characteristics they embody, such race, ethnicity, gender, disability and sexual orientation, Milli said. For wage gap strategies to succeed, individuals, businesses and governments will have to employ a multi-faceted approach.\n\u201cEveryone benefits from advancing social justice and reducing economic inequality,\u201d Milli said.\nWomen\u2019s participation in the labor force dropped to a 30-year low during the pandemic, the result of layoffs and added caregiver responsibilities. Those who remained, particularly those with lower incomes, were more likely to hold jobs that defined them as \u201cessential workers\u201d in health care, social work, government, and community-based services. Still, those women earned much less than their male counterparts.\nSexism, exploitation and bias have contributed to the gender pay gap. At the same time, efforts to bring fairness and opportunity to all have been a part of our nation\u2019s history. The 1963 Equal Pay Act made it illegal to pay men and women different salaries for similar work. At the time, women made 59 cents for every dollar men made. Nearly 60 years later, the gap has closed by 21 cents.\nIn 1972, the Equal Rights Amendment passed \u2014 making it illegal to deny women any rights on the basis of sex. But opposition groups prevented its ratification. Today, community leaders are working together to erase the wage gap, including in Kansas City, Missouri.\nGovernments, employers and communities can ensure women receive equal wages for equal work. An economy that works for everyone includes equal pay in living wage jobs and work-family supports. Promising policy solutions include:\nTransparency laws. Some states and cities have passed laws that require employers to report gender wage gap data, prohibit employers from asking about salary history, post jobs with pay ranges based on skills and qualifications, and ban employers from preventing employees discussing their pay.\nHigher wages. Advocates for equal pay recommend raising the minimum wage and ensuring that employees are paid a living wage, or the amount required to pay for basic needs. Raising the minimum wage has the potential to decrease disparities by gender and race/ethnicity. Women stand to benefit most, as women account for just over half of workers who would benefit from a minimum\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

In reality, the statistic that women earn 77 cents to the male dollar reflects real structural barriers to equality deserving of attention.\nBuilding an Economy for All, Economy, Women\u2019s Issues, +2 More\nDirector, Media Relations\ncunkenholz@americanprogress.org\nInterim Executive Vice President, Communications\njcusick@americanprogress.org\nSenior Director, Government Affairs\nmshepherd@americanprogress.org\nThe most commonly cited statistic for the gender wage gap asserts that women earn only 77 cents for every dollar earned by men. However, a great deal of contention surrounds statistics measuring and quantifying the gender wage gap, and this confusion is not entirely without merit. Some of the controversy around wage-gap estimates and figures is at least partly due to the fact that, like many statistics, the exact figure changes slightly depending on the data source used. With competing statistics and a highly politicized issue, the very existence of the wage gap is often called into question\u2014along with its significance and driving causes.\nThe \u201c77 cents\u201d formulation is a colloquialism\u2014shorthand for expressing a complex economic truth. Simply put, what it conveys is the fact that, if you average out what all women, working full time, year round, earn and compare that number to what all men working full time, year round, earn, you find that women take home 77 percent of what men do.\nThe confusion around wage-gap calculations is further fueled when people misspeak about the nature of the number, what it reflects, and to which groups of workers it refers. To be very clear, the 77-cents-on-the-dollar statistic does not compare men and women doing identical work. This has led to critics charging that the 77-cent figure is a willful manipulation of truth that does not accurately reflect gender discrimination in the workplace. In reality, the 77-cent figure does capture some discrimination, but it also reflects gender differences in jobs, hours worked, years of experience, educational attainment, or personal choices that people make about their careers. Incorporating these significant factors is precisely what makes the number valuable.\nThis issue brief explains how the wage gap is calculated, why the numbers are not all the same, and what causes are driving the most commonly cited 77-cent figure.\nLike all statistics, the 77-cent statistic tells a particular story. It\u2019s calculated by dividing the median earnings of full-time, year-round, working women by the median earnings of full-time, year-round, working men, all rounded to the nearest $100.\nThe wage gap looks slightly different depending on which data source is used in the calculation. Outcomes look marginally different, for example, depending on whether weekly or annual earnings are compared. Annual data for 2012, the latest year for which data are available, estimate that women earn 77 percent of what men do for working full time, year round, while weekly data put the estimate at 82.1 percent. But this is not an issue unique to calculating the gender wage gap, since most statistics vary slightly when pulling data from different sources using different measures of analysis. Similarly, the estimate of the median annual wage for all full-time workers regardless of gender\u2014$45,535 in 2012\u2014is not the same as the median weekly wage for all full-time workers\u2014$765 to $772 depending on the quarter\u2014multiplied by 52.\nThe annual wage-gap statistic average is compiled by grouping together many people\u2014and, as such, it has its caveats. In real life, men and women often do not hold the same jobs. Neither do they, on average, have the same years of experience, work the same hours, or equally share the responsibility of childbirth and child care. All of these factors translate, to different degrees, into lower pay.\nAnd it\u2019s all of these factors coming together\u2014in the same way that they do in real life\u2014that gives the 77-cent comparison meaning. The varied factors that influence the wage gap\u2014different jobs, different hours, and different work histories\u2014are not purely the result of women\u2019s choices. There are significant structural factors that influence the decisions working women make that result in lower pay, and these deserve as much attention as overt discrimination.\nOne of the largest driving factors of the gender wage gap is the fact that men and women, on average, work in different industries and occupations; this accounts for up to 49.3 percent of the wage gap, according to some estimates. Women are much more likely than men to be clustered in just a few occupations, with nearly half of all working women\u201444.4 percent\u2014employed in just 20 occupations, including secretaries and administrative assistants, registered nurses, and school teachers. Meanwhile, only about one-third\u201434.8 percent\u2014of men are employed in the top 20 occupations for male workers, including truck drivers, managers, and supervisors.\nInterestingly, only four occupations\u2014retail salespersons, first-line supervisors and managers of retail stores, cooks, and all other managers\u2014appear in both genders\u2019 top 20 most common occupations. Not only are women more likely to be concentrated in fewer types of jobs, those jobs are more likely to be female dominated\u2014a fact that often leads to lower wages. Female-dominated industries pay lower wages than male-dominated industries requiring similar skill levels, and the effect is stronger in jobs that require higher levels of education.Women are more likely to be concentrated in low-wage work,and they make up the majority of minimum-wage workers in the United States. The top 10 occupations for women all pay men more on average, including secretaries and administrative a\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

I've heard that it is true and I've heard it's misleading.\n\nFull Page Content:\nConnecting the gender pay gap to health\nThe gender pay gap is expected to persist for decades, particularly for women of color and in rural areas. What can we do to reverse this trend? How can we work together to improve the health and well-being of women and their children, entire communities and the overall economy? When women have opportunities, such as a fair chance for education, employment, and earnings, they are more likely to live longer and healthier lives. Their children are also more likely to fare better.\nFor the nation\u2019s women who work outside the home, decades of economic insecurity and pay inequity were made worse by the pandemic. On average, women in the U.S. earn little more than 80 cents for every dollar white men make. The gap exists in nearly every county across the country but is at its widest in rural areas where women earn 77 cents, on average, for every dollar men make. Women also earn less than men for similar work in Southern and Western Plains states.\nIf trends of the last 35 years continue, it would take decades longer for women living in rural areas to receive equal pay for comparable work. For all regions of the country, by the earliest estimates, it would take white women until 2069 to earn what white men make, Black and Indigenous women until 2369 and Hispanic women until 2451, according to the American Association of University Women.\n\u201cThe biggest myth that the general population has about the gender wage gap is that it\u2019s getting a lot better,\u201d said Dr. Jessamyn Schaller, an economics professor at Claremont McKenna College. \u201cThere is definitely still a substantial gender wage gap.\u201d\nThe earnings lost as a result of the pay gap have meant women have had fewer opportunities to make ends meet, let alone save for emergencies or retirement.\nRacial and gender discrimination have contributed to a system that has long undervalued and underpaid women. Biases exist at all stages of employment \u2014 from hiring and performance reviews to layoffs. The pandemic exposed the barriers that have prevented women and caregivers from participating in the workforce. A lack of supports \u2014 such as paid sick leave and family leave \u2014 and high child care costs placed additional burdens on women. This was especially true for those with low incomes and women of color \u2013 the two groups least likely to receive employer-provided benefits.\nThe gaps remain despite women\u2019s educational gains; women have made up the majority of the college-educated population for more than 40 years. In addition, women have been segregated into lower-paying sectors such as service, education and health care. Yet even in these industries, men earn more than women for equal work. The wage gap widens as women attain higher levels of education and advance to more senior positions.\nSeveral factors influence the differences seen in wages across the country. The types of jobs available are often limited in rural areas. Cultural norms in some areas also dictate the fields women enter and the prevalence of gender discrimination.\nMost women face some barriers based on their gender regardless of their location. Yet women of\ncolor experience wage gaps wider than their gender or race would explain individually.\n\u201cBeing a woman of color is worse than a double whammy when it comes to pay inequality,\u201d said Dr. Jessica Milli, an economist who studies the gender pay gap. \u201cThis means that the labor market might be discriminating against women of color in very specific ways. That there are systemic barriers that they face in advancing in the workplace that are unique to their identities as women of color.\u201d\nPeople experience bias and discrimination differently based on the combination of characteristics they embody, such race, ethnicity, gender, disability and sexual orientation, Milli said. For wage gap strategies to succeed, individuals, businesses and governments will have to employ a multi-faceted approach.\n\u201cEveryone benefits from advancing social justice and reducing economic inequality,\u201d Milli said.\nWomen\u2019s participation in the labor force dropped to a 30-year low during the pandemic, the result of layoffs and added caregiver responsibilities. Those who remained, particularly those with lower incomes, were more likely to hold jobs that defined them as \u201cessential workers\u201d in health care, social work, government, and community-based services. Still, those women earned much less than their male counterparts.\nSexism, exploitation and bias have contributed to the gender pay gap. At the same time, efforts to bring fairness and opportunity to all have been a part of our nation\u2019s history. The 1963 Equal Pay Act made it illegal to pay men and women different salaries for similar work. At the time, women made 59 cents for every dollar men made. Nearly 60 years later, the gap has closed by 21 cents.\nIn 1972, the Equal Rights Amendment passed \u2014 making it illegal to deny women any rights on the basis of sex. But opposition groups prevented its ratification. Today, community leaders are working together to erase the wage gap, including in Kansas City, Missouri.\nGovernments, employers and communities can ensure women receive equal wages for equal work. An economy that works for everyone includes equal pay in living wage jobs and work-family supports. Promising policy solutions include:\nTransparency laws. Some states and cities have passed laws that require employers to report gender wage gap data, prohibit employers from asking about salary history, post jobs with pay ranges based on skills and qualifications, and ban employers from preventing employees discussing their pay.\nHigher wages. Advocates for equal pay recommend raising the minimum wage and ensuring that employees are paid a living wage, or the amount required to pay for basic needs. Raising the minimum wage has the potential to decrease disparities by gender and race/ethnicity. Women stand to benefit most, as women account for just over half of workers who would benefit from a minimum\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

What can we do to reverse this trend? How can we work together to improve the health and well-being of women and their children, entire communities and the overall economy? When women have opportunities, such as a fair chance for education, employment, and earnings, they are more likely to live longer and healthier lives. Their children are also more likely to fare better.\nFor the nation\u2019s women who work outside the home, decades of economic insecurity and pay inequity were made worse by the pandemic. On average, women in the U.S. earn little more than 80 cents for every dollar white men make. The gap exists in nearly every county across the country but is at its widest in rural areas where women earn 77 cents, on average, for every dollar men make. Women also earn less than men for similar work in Southern and Western Plains states.\nIf trends of the last 35 years continue, it would take decades longer for women living in rural areas to receive equal pay for comparable work. For all regions of the country, by the earliest estimates, it would take white women until 2069 to earn what white men make, Black and Indigenous women until 2369 and Hispanic women until 2451, according to the American Association of University Women.\n\u201cThe biggest myth that the general population has about the gender wage gap is that it\u2019s getting a lot better,\u201d said Dr. Jessamyn Schaller, an economics professor at Claremont McKenna College. \u201cThere is definitely still a substantial gender wage gap.\u201d\nThe earnings lost as a result of the pay gap have meant women have had fewer opportunities to make ends meet, let alone save for emergencies or retirement.\nRacial and gender discrimination have contributed to a system that has long undervalued and underpaid women. Biases exist at all stages of employment \u2014 from hiring and performance reviews to layoffs. The pandemic exposed the barriers that have prevented women and caregivers from participating in the workforce. A lack of supports \u2014 such as paid sick leave and family leave \u2014 and high child care costs placed additional burdens on women. This was especially true for those with low incomes and women of color \u2013 the two groups least likely to receive employer-provided benefits.\nThe gaps remain despite women\u2019s educational gains; women have made up the majority of the college-educated population for more than 40 years. In addition, women have been segregated into lower-paying sectors such as service, education and health care. Yet even in these industries, men earn more than women for equal work. The wage gap widens as women attain higher levels of education and advance to more senior positions.\nSeveral factors influence the differences seen in wages across the country. The types of jobs available are often limited in rural areas. Cultural norms in some areas also dictate the fields women enter and the prevalence of gender discrimination.\nMost women face some barriers based on their gender regardless of their location. Yet women of\ncolor experience wage gaps wider than their gender or race would explain individually.\n\u201cBeing a woman of color is worse than a double whammy when it comes to pay inequality,\u201d said Dr. Jessica Milli, an economist who studies the gender pay gap. \u201cThis means that the labor market might be discriminating against women of color in very specific ways. That there are systemic barriers that they face in advancing in the workplace that are unique to their identities as women of color.\u201d\nPeople experience bias and discrimination differently based on the combination of characteristics they embody, such race, ethnicity, gender, disability and sexual orientation, Milli said. For wage gap strategies to succeed, individuals, businesses and governments will have to employ a multi-faceted approach.\n\u201cEveryone benefits from advancing social justice and reducing economic inequality,\u201d Milli said.\nWomen\u2019s participation in the labor force dropped to a 30-year low during the pandemic, the result of layoffs and added caregiver responsibilities. Those who remained, particularly those with lower incomes, were more likely to hold jobs that defined them as \u201cessential workers\u201d in health care, social work, government, and community-based services. Still, those women earned much less than their male counterparts.\nSexism, exploitation and bias have contributed to the gender pay gap. At the same time, efforts to bring fairness and opportunity to all have been a part of our nation\u2019s history. The 1963 Equal Pay Act made it illegal to pay men and women different salaries for similar work. At the time, women made 59 cents for every dollar men made. Nearly 60 years later, the gap has closed by 21 cents.\nIn 1972, the Equal Rights Amendment passed \u2014 making it illegal to deny women any rights on the basis of sex. But opposition groups prevented its ratification. Today, community leaders are working together to erase the wage gap, including in Kansas City, Missouri.\nGovernments, employers and communities can ensure women receive equal wages for equal work. An economy that works for everyone includes equal pay in living wage jobs and work-family supports. Promising policy solutions include:\nTransparency laws. Some states and cities have passed laws that require employers to report gender wage gap data, prohibit employers from asking about salary history, post jobs with pay ranges based on skills and qualifications, and ban employers from preventing employees discussing their pay.\nHigher wages. Advocates for equal pay recommend raising the minimum wage and ensuring that employees are paid a living wage, or the amount required to pay for basic needs.

What can we do to reverse this trend? How can we work together to improve the health and well-being of women and their children, entire communities and the overall economy? When women have opportunities, such as a fair chance for education, employment, and earnings, they are more likely to live longer and healthier lives. Their children are also more likely to fare better.\nFor the nation\u2019s women who work outside the home, decades of economic insecurity and pay inequity were made worse by the pandemic. On average, women in the U.S. earn little more than 80 cents for every dollar white men make. The gap exists in nearly every county across the country but is at its widest in rural areas where women earn 77 cents, on average, for every dollar men make. Women also earn less than men for similar work in Southern and Western Plains states.\nIf trends of the last 35 years continue, it would take decades longer for women living in rural areas to receive equal pay for comparable work. For all regions of the country, by the earliest estimates, it would take white women until 2069 to earn what white men make, Black and Indigenous women until 2369 and Hispanic women until 2451, according to the American Association of University Women.\n\u201cThe biggest myth that the general population has about the gender wage gap is that it\u2019s getting a lot better,\u201d said Dr. Jessamyn Schaller, an economics professor at Claremont McKenna College. \u201cThere is definitely still a substantial gender wage gap.\u201d\nThe earnings lost as a result of the pay gap have meant women have had fewer opportunities to make ends meet, let alone save for emergencies or retirement.\nRacial and gender discrimination have contributed to a system that has long undervalued and underpaid women. Biases exist at all stages of employment \u2014 from hiring and performance reviews to layoffs. The pandemic exposed the barriers that have prevented women and caregivers from participating in the workforce. A lack of supports \u2014 such as paid sick leave and family leave \u2014 and high child care costs placed additional burdens on women. This was especially true for those with low incomes and women of color \u2013 the two groups least likely to receive employer-provided benefits.\nThe gaps remain despite women\u2019s educational gains; women have made up the majority of the college-educated population for more than 40 years. In addition, women have been segregated into lower-paying sectors such as service, education and health care. Yet even in these industries, men earn more than women for equal work. The wage gap widens as women attain higher levels of education and advance to more senior positions.\nSeveral factors influence the differences seen in wages across the country. The types of jobs available are often limited in rural areas. Cultural norms in some areas also dictate the fields women enter and the prevalence of gender discrimination.\nMost women face some barriers based on their gender regardless of their location. Yet women of\ncolor experience wage gaps wider than their gender or race would explain individually.\n\u201cBeing a woman of color is worse than a double whammy when it comes to pay inequality,\u201d said Dr. Jessica Milli, an economist who studies the gender pay gap. \u201cThis means that the labor market might be discriminating against women of color in very specific ways. That there are systemic barriers that they face in advancing in the workplace that are unique to their identities as women of color.\u201d\nPeople experience bias and discrimination differently based on the combination of characteristics they embody, such race, ethnicity, gender, disability and sexual orientation, Milli said. For wage gap strategies to succeed, individuals, businesses and governments will have to employ a multi-faceted approach.\n\u201cEveryone benefits from advancing social justice and reducing economic inequality,\u201d Milli said.\nWomen\u2019s participation in the labor force dropped to a 30-year low during the pandemic, the result of layoffs and added caregiver responsibilities. Those who remained, particularly those with lower incomes, were more likely to hold jobs that defined them as \u201cessential workers\u201d in health care, social work, government, and community-based services. Still, those women earned much less than their male counterparts.\nSexism, exploitation and bias have contributed to the gender pay gap. At the same time, efforts to bring fairness and opportunity to all have been a part of our nation\u2019s history. The 1963 Equal Pay Act made it illegal to pay men and women different salaries for similar work. At the time, women made 59 cents for every dollar men made. Nearly 60 years later, the gap has closed by 21 cents.\nIn 1972, the Equal Rights Amendment passed \u2014 making it illegal to deny women any rights on the basis of sex. But opposition groups prevented its ratification. Today, community leaders are working together to erase the wage gap, including in Kansas City, Missouri.\nGovernments, employers and communities can ensure women receive equal wages for equal work. An economy that works for everyone includes equal pay in living wage jobs and work-family supports. Promising policy solutions include:\nTransparency laws. Some states and cities have passed laws that require employers to report gender wage gap data, prohibit employers from asking about salary history, post jobs with pay ranges based on skills and qualifications, and ban employers from preventing employees discussing their pay.\nHigher wages. Advocates for equal pay recommend raising the minimum wage and ensuring that employees are paid a living wage, or the amount required to pay for basic needs. Raising the minimum wage has the potential to decrease disparities by gender and race/ethnicity. Women stand to benefit most, as women account for just over half of workers who would benefit from a minimum\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The gap exists in nearly every county across the country but is at its widest in rural areas where women earn 77 cents, on average, for every dollar men make. Women also earn less than men for similar work in Southern and Western Plains states.\nIf trends of the last 35 years continue, it would take decades longer for women living in rural areas to receive equal pay for comparable work. For all regions of the country, by the earliest estimates, it would take white women until 2069 to earn what white men make, Black and Indigenous women until 2369 and Hispanic women until 2451, according to the American Association of University Women.\n\u201cThe biggest myth that the general population has about the gender wage gap is that it\u2019s getting a lot better,\u201d said Dr. Jessamyn Schaller, an economics professor at Claremont McKenna College. \u201cThere is definitely still a substantial gender wage gap.\u201d\nThe earnings lost as a result of the pay gap have meant women have had fewer opportunities to make ends meet, let alone save for emergencies or retirement.\nRacial and gender discrimination have contributed to a system that has long undervalued and underpaid women. Biases exist at all stages of employment \u2014 from hiring and performance reviews to layoffs. The pandemic exposed the barriers that have prevented women and caregivers from participating in the workforce. A lack of supports \u2014 such as paid sick leave and family leave \u2014 and high child care costs placed additional burdens on women. This was especially true for those with low incomes and women of color \u2013 the two groups least likely to receive employer-provided benefits.\nThe gaps remain despite women\u2019s educational gains; women have made up the majority of the college-educated population for more than 40 years. In addition, women have been segregated into lower-paying sectors such as service, education and health care. Yet even in these industries, men earn more than women for equal work. The wage gap widens as women attain higher levels of education and advance to more senior positions.\nSeveral factors influence the differences seen in wages across the country. The types of jobs available are often limited in rural areas. Cultural norms in some areas also dictate the fields women enter and the prevalence of gender discrimination.\nMost women face some barriers based on their gender regardless of their location. Yet women of\ncolor experience wage gaps wider than their gender or race would explain individually.\n\u201cBeing a woman of color is worse than a double whammy when it comes to pay inequality,\u201d said Dr. Jessica Milli, an economist who studies the gender pay gap. \u201cThis means that the labor market might be discriminating against women of color in very specific ways. That there are systemic barriers that they face in advancing in the workplace that are unique to their identities as women of color.\u201d\nPeople experience bias and discrimination differently based on the combination of characteristics they embody, such race, ethnicity, gender, disability and sexual orientation, Milli said. For wage gap strategies to succeed, individuals, businesses and governments will have to employ a multi-faceted approach.\n\u201cEveryone benefits from advancing social justice and reducing economic inequality,\u201d Milli said.\nWomen\u2019s participation in the labor force dropped to a 30-year low during the pandemic, the result of layoffs and added caregiver responsibilities. Those who remained, particularly those with lower incomes, were more likely to hold jobs that defined them as \u201cessential workers\u201d in health care, social work, government, and community-based services. Still, those women earned much less than their male counterparts.\nSexism, exploitation and bias have contributed to the gender pay gap. At the same time, efforts to bring fairness and opportunity to all have been a part of our nation\u2019s history. The 1963 Equal Pay Act made it illegal to pay men and women different salaries for similar work. At the time, women made 59 cents for every dollar men made. Nearly 60 years later, the gap has closed by 21 cents.\nIn 1972, the Equal Rights Amendment passed \u2014 making it illegal to deny women any rights on the basis of sex. But opposition groups prevented its ratification. Today, community leaders are working together to erase the wage gap, including in Kansas City, Missouri.\nGovernments, employers and communities can ensure women receive equal wages for equal work. An economy that works for everyone includes equal pay in living wage jobs and work-family supports. Promising policy solutions include:\nTransparency laws. Some states and cities have passed laws that require employers to report gender wage gap data, prohibit employers from asking about salary history, post jobs with pay ranges based on skills and qualifications, and ban employers from preventing employees discussing their pay.\nHigher wages. Advocates for equal pay recommend raising the minimum wage and ensuring that employees are paid a living wage, or the amount required to pay for basic needs. Raising the minimum wage has the potential to decrease disparities by gender and race/ethnicity. Women stand to benefit most, as women account for just over half of workers who would benefit from a minimum\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

According to the report, the gaps varied by role and level of education.\nAccording to Healthcare Finance News, the findings are largely in line with research released by Medscape and HIMSS that show male primary care physicians earned an average of 18% more than their female counterparts, with men averaging $239,000 and women averaging $203,000. Similarly, men in specialties earn an average of $358,000, while women earn an average of $263,000.\nOne factor driving the gender pay gap may be that men more frequently negotiate their salaries, Healthcare Finance News reports. The Nursing Salary Research Report found that 43% of men said they negotiated their salaries \"most of the time or always,\" while just 34% of women said the same.\nRobert Hess Jr., the EVP and chief clinical executive of health care for OnCourse Learning, said, \"Even taking into account total hours worked, years of nursing experience, age, education level, and certification status, men still are making more money than women.\"\nBrent MacWilliams, president of the American Association for Men in Nursing, said that men have traditionally \"gravitated toward acute care, high-paid specialties and to management/administration, which are all higher paying.\" However, the Nursing Salary Research Report shows that \"men are being paid significantly more than women in the profession doing comparable work.\" MacWilliams added that he would \"call on employers to assess their current workforce for gender gaps and raise salaries to create parity\" (Nursing Salary Research Report, accessed 6/20; Lagasse, Healthcare Finance News, 6/18).\nIn 2016, millennials surpassed Baby Boomers as the largest living generation in the United States.

From the pioneering work of Friedrich Froebel\u2019s \u201ckindergarten\u201d concept, which was largely implemented and popularized by women, to Maria Montessori\u2019s revolutionary educational philosophy, women have consistently championed child-centered learning. Figures like Susan Blow, who established the first public kindergarten in the United States, and Patty Smith Hill, who advocated for play-based learning, shaped the landscape of early education. These women not only established educational practices but also fought for the professionalization of early childhood teaching, laying the groundwork for the field\u2019s ongoing evolution and recognition.\nLike my grandmother, most early childhood educators are women. In the United States, about 97% of early childhood educators are women. Early childhood educators are also largely underpaid. Research for Action\u2019s (RFA) work on teacher retention in early childhood (here and here) consistently demonstrates that compensation is the number one reason that early childhood educators leave the field.\nThe impact of low wages isn\u2019t just a personal issue for educators\u2014it\u2019s a crisis for the entire early education system. Many teachers leave because they simply can\u2019t afford to stay. In a recent study, RFA found that nearly 30% of Head Start teachers left their jobs in the 2021-22 program year. That\u2019s nearly one-third of the workforce turning over in a single year.\nSuch high rates of turnover mean that kids lose out on consistent relationships with teachers they trust. It also means that there is more strain on the educators who persist in the field. High turnover rates can lead to classrooms that are short-staffed and already-burdened administrators who struggle to hire replacements and train new staff.\nMy grandmother understood, and our research here at RFA bears out, that high-quality early education benefits us all. When kids get a strong start, we all have a more educated workforce and stronger communities. We need educator compensation that reflects that reality.\nDr. Kendall LaParo (she/her) leads mixed-methods and quasi-experimental evaluations of several education programs, including out-of-school-time programs and teacher professional development initiatives.

To fill this talent gap, many countries in the region have provided more opportunities in recent years for its female workforce, allowing women to take advantage of higher education and industry-specific training.\nStill, a gender imbalance in the workforce remains. Texas A&M University at Qatar (TAMUQ) and Northwestern University in Qatar cited that as the key motivation behind a recent study exploring the obstacles that female petroleum engineers face.\nTo gauge the oil and industry\u2019s progress on gender equality in the workforce \u2013 both in Qatar and in the wider Persian Gulf region \u2013 the two schools conducted interviews in 2020-2021 with nine women and three men working in the industry. Based on the personal experiences shared by those interviewees, the schools analyzed the findings and then provided recommendations for organizations to help support women across all career levels. In particular, the study called for more opportunities and encouragement for women to pursue upper management positions.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to see what the challenges are,\u201d Albertus Retnanto, Professor of Petroleum Engineering at TAMUQ, said of the project\u2019s goals. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening to women when they\u2019re looking to get in the industry, and what happens to them once they get here?

Although not every participant was working in Qatar at the time of the study, they each had ties to the country, either through education or former employment. Companies with employees represented in the study include BP, ConocoPhillips, Halliburton, QatarEnergy, Shell and SLB.\nAmong the top challenges the participants cited when talking to the researchers were a lack of policies or initiatives to promote women into executive positions, as well as explicit discouragement or even discrimination by coworkers and managers during the recruiting and hiring process. For instance, female participants said they had to deal with biased assumptions and overly personal interview questions that were irrelevant to their professional capabilities and experiences.\nSeveral participants in the study also said they saw a stigma placed on women who wanted to take on technical field-based jobs. One woman noted that she was frequently questioned on why she would want to study petroleum engineering and work in the oilfield, and was even told that women were better suited for office-based positions. Another woman noted that a recruiter suggested she not apply for a specific position because it was a \u201cvery male job.\u201d\nBoth men and women interviewed in the study pointed out that female new-hires were often sidelined into non-technical positions with limited opportunities to advance or have influence. This created a negative environment where other women would then seek office-based jobs instead of field jobs in order to avoid being scrutinized by male coworkers.\nParticipants also discussed the cultural and social barriers that women had to confront. This included a lack of proper accommodations for women working on offshore rigs \u2013 several female interviewees mentioned, for example, a lack of women-only restrooms. There is often also a lack of PPE fitted for women, including coveralls and headgear for women who wear a hijab.\nThe study also noted that company restrictions on women traveling alone was still common; one participant said her employer does not allow its female employees to travel without a mahram, or a male blood relative. Policies like this can restrict women from pursuing and exploring the various opportunities that their employer offers, like traveling to industry conferences or business meetings, or transfers to foreign countries.\nOne male participant who was interviewed suggested that appointing more women to managerial positions can help to address some of these issues. The study noted his comment around how cultivating \u201ca diversity of gender allows us to be a lot more effective and solve problems in a smart way versus having only one way of thinking.\u201d\nOne female participant said she has seen, in many instances, that men are willing to help women when they face a lack of accommodations \u2013 for instance, not objecting when women have to use men\u2019s restrooms on a rig. At the same time, she expressed skepticism that the industry will see significant change \u2013 especially in terms of providing women-specific accommodations \u2013 until there are more female managers setting policy and more women working at wellsites.\nSuccesses and suggestions\nWhile the experiences shared by the participants clearly show there is a need for improvement, the study also pointed to signs of progress. BP\u2019s Young Adventurers camp in the United Arab Emirates is a good example. While it\u2019s not meant only for women, it is inclusive of women and encourages them to consider engineering careers.

The campers are divided by gender, and the women\u2019s camp features an all-female staff.\nOne woman in the study said she participated in the camp when she was younger, and even cited the experience as a key factor in her decision to study engineering in school and, ultimately, begin an oilfield career.

In addition to the severe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the global energy transition and the continued growth of digitization have accelerated both the need for and the pace of change.\nThe percentage of women working in the oil and gas industry remains unchanged at 22%, the same level reported in 2017. The pandemic and associated oil price shock likely impacted progress, which underscored the need for continued focus, commitment, and action to improve diversity and inclusion (D&I). There are glimmers of hope: the number of D&I policies and programs introduced by companies is up by about 50% since 2017, indicating that even though outcomes stalled, the commitment to act and lay foundations for future progress strengthened throughout the period.\nMore must be done to achieve gender parity and improve diversity. Significant gaps in policies and programs remain. Less than half of companies link leadership compensation to D&I goals. And only one-third have procedures to ensure \u201cblind\u201d screening of candidates to remove unconscious recruiter biases.\nCompanies must take urgent action to boost diversity among their employees and make diversity a strategic priority if they are to thrive in a data-driven, low-carbon world. This new world will require innovation, and innovation requires diversity; BCG has found that companies with greater diversity outperform others on both innovation and EBIT.1 To attract and retain a more diverse talent pool, companies need to adopt practical measures such as flexible working and must accelerate efforts to create an inclusive environment. In addition, industry values and priorities must align more closely with those of potential new hires\u2014on climate issues, but also on social equity issues and on the definition of diversity itself.\nWhile other sectors have realized the importance of purpose-led work, better work-life balance, and equity, many oil and gas companies have only recently begun to commit to this journey in earnest. Our research shows that although the importance of race is increasing in the oil and gas sector\u2019s D&I conversation (based on industry press coverage), gender remains the primary topic.\nSo far, oil and gas companies have undertaken fairly simple and straightforward D&I initiatives and have met local regulatory and legal requirements. Further progress will require business leaders and managers to take harder steps\u2014questioning unconscious bias far more and making deliberate decisions to boost diversity and inclusion in their hiring choices, policies, and support throughout employees\u2019 career life cycle. Such an effort calls for a more intentional and proactive approach, led from the top, that embeds D&I values in all key business processes, especially HR-related ones. According to our findings, five challenges require especially urgent attention:\nThere are some positive signs that companies have taken action since 2017 to support diversity:\nThe industry\u2019s more active approach has yielded positive results in important areas. While women\u2019s overall representation in the industry has remained flat, the share of women in global companies (those with operations in multiple countries) has risen slightly from 24% to 25%, and the proportion of women at global companies entering the industry as university graduates has also increased slightly, from 26% to 28%. In addition, the number of D&I policies and programs implemented by companies (across all types of interventions) has increased, on average, by about 50%\u2014a significant and very positive shift since 2017.\nNotably, all of the companies that we surveyed in 2020 offer maternity leave, and more than 95% of them support equal pay, offer paternity leave, and have sexual harassment policies in place (versus 90% of companies offering maternity leave, 67% of companies supporting equal pay, and 56% of companies providing paternity leave in 2017). Now that these critical table stakes (which are often mandated by governments) are widely in place, companies are starting to explore more advanced policies and programs, including childcare support and making diversity a key component of leadership remuneration.\nThe business case is clear. By creating a more diverse and inclusive culture, oil and gas companies can benefit from greater depth and breadth of perspective and can boost business performance. According to Catalyst, a nonprofit organization, companies with more women on their board of directors outperformed those with the least on three financial measures: return on equity (53% higher), return on sales (42% higher), and return on invested capital (66% higher). Another study shows that companies with top-quartile performance on ethnic and racial diversity enjoyed 35% higher financial returns, and those with top-quartile gender diversity were 15% more likely to have returns above industry mean.3 But how can senior leaders create an environment that attracts, retains, and advances diverse individuals whose profiles differ from the dominant ones?\nIn the course of our research, we\u2019ve identified three essential elements that together form a framework for a successful D&I strategy. (See Exhibit 1.)\nThey are as follows:\nOur research and industry engagement indicate that the following six ways of addressing these ongoing challenges are likely to have the most impact across all career levels:\nThe first two approaches are especially relevant for the \u201cleadership\u201d level in our framework, while the final four relate to the \u201coperating model\u201d level of the framework.\nTo support companies in identifying the actions they need to take to drive an increase in diversity outcomes, BCG and the WPC have developed the Diversity and Inclusion Maturity Assessment tool, which rates com\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",
