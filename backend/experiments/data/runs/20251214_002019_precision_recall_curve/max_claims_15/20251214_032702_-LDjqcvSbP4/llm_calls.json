Posted on 2/20/2023 by Team at Frank Dunlap It has been estimated that more than 60% of adults in the United States drink with a straw. That's right, two-thirds of us sip iced tea, iced coffee, and even water through one long tube! The reason for this is simple: it helps to prevent tooth decay. But does it work? Well, read on to find out! Why Drinking With A Straw Does Not Protect Your Teeth Drinking through a straw is not the magical solution that many people think it is. Even though using a straw can help protect your teeth from stains, it doesn't keep them free of cavities or other dental problems. Most drinks we use straws with are not healthy for us anyway. Many people drink sodas, fruit juices, and sports drinks with straws because they think it will save their teeth from getting stained or damaged. This is just an illusion of safety that could be harmful to your health in the long run. Sugar Is More Harmful To Your Teeth Than The Acid In Soda And Fruit Juice Although most people are fearful of the acidity in soda and fruit juice, sugar is more harmful to your teeth. According to the National Institute of Dental & Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), sugars break down into acids that attack tooth enamel when exposed to heat or moisture for a long time. How To Protect Your Teeth From Harmful Drinks To protect your teeth from harmful drinks, you should decrease or limit the number of acidic beverages in your diet. Acidic beverages include soda, fruit juice, sports drinks, among many others. Be sure to drink plenty of water throughout the day instead of sugary sodas or sports drinks. Water keeps saliva flowing, which helps neutralize acidity levels in the mouth while washing away food particles before they have a chance to stick onto tooth enamel. Drinking water with meals can also help reduce plaque buildup on dental surfaces due to certain types of starchy foods like bread and cereals that are found at many dinners. There are a lot of misconceptions about what is good for your teeth.

However, there are also studies that fail to support this relationship, especially when intakes are at levels that mirror typical consumption( 3 ). The research on fructose also has implicated this sugar as having possible health risks, although the interpretation of this hypothesis has noteworthy limitations. The results of animal studies are frequently extrapolated to man even though there are metabolic differences related to fructose metabolism, while human clinical studies often suffer from methodological issues that can affect their interpretation and application to the general human population( 4 , 5 ). For example, in most clinical studies fructose levels far exceed those consumed by the general population. Nevertheless, the potential health effects related to the consumption or overconsumption of sugars and fructose have captured the spotlight in scientific journal editorials and commentary( 6 , 7 ) and the lay press( 8 \u2013 10 ), as well as in business/finance institution reports related to global sugar consumption and health impacts( 11 ). While most of the attention has focused on beverages containing added sugars, particularly high-fructose corn syrup, 100 % fruit juices (FJ) have been swept into the discourse because of their sugar and fructose contents( 12 , 13 ), which come not from added sugars but as naturally occurring sugars in the whole fruit. As a result, 100 % FJ is often discussed in a context that focuses solely on its sugar content and neglects the nutritional value and potential health benefits associated with including 100 % FJ in the diet. Moreover, the evidence to date suggests that the adverse effects associated with excess added sugar or fructose intake are not observed with respect to the consumption of 100 % FJ at typical amounts.\nA number of observational studies have investigated the relationship between 100 % FJ intake and anthropometric measures in children and/or adolescents. A comprehensive review article published in 2008 evaluated the results of twenty-one studies (nine cross-sectional and twelve longitudinal)( 14 ). Only three out of nine cross-sectional studies and three out of twelve longitudinal studies reported a positive association between 100 % FJ intake and weight status. After critically reviewing the quality of the studies, the authors concluded that there was no systematic association between 100 % FJ intake and body weight in children or adolescents. As analysed in the review, three longitudinal studies reported significant associations between 100 % FJ intake and weight or BMI in adolescent girls in Germany( 15 ) or low-income children who were overweight or at risk for overweight at baseline in the USA( 16 , 17 ). The two latter studies included relatively large sample sizes, yet none of the three studies used a nationally representative sample. Observational studies concerning FJ intake and anthropometric measures in children and adolescents published since the 2008 review are summarized in Table 1. Several cross-sectional and longitudinal studies published since the 2008 review report no association between 100 % FJ consumption and obesity or BMI in children and adolescents, including Mexican-American children in California( 18 ), Swedish adolescents( 19 ), Greek schoolchildren( 20 ), Canadian children( 21 ), children in a California WIC (Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children)( 22 ), and adolescents in Project EAT (Eating Among Teens)( 23 ) and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)( 24 ). A multi-year and multi-state analysis of over 272 000 adolescents from the Youth Risk Behavior Survey reported an inverse association between 100 % FJ intake and BMI in girls and a null association in boys( 25 ). These results should be interpreted with caution since height and weight were self-reported and adolescent females tend to under-report their weight( 26 , 27 ). One longitudinal study reported a significant association between the amount of FJ consumed by children at age 1 year and BMI Z-score during early and mid-childhood( 28 ), while an inverse association was reported between fruit and vegetable juice intake during childhood and waist circumference and skinfold measurements in adolescence( 29 ). Two recent reviews of the literature, including an analysis by a workgroup on behalf of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics\u2019 Evidence Analysis Library, concluded that the majority of evidence does not support an association between 100 % FJ consumption and weight status or adiposity in children 2\u201318 years of age( 30 , 31 ).
