    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\n[Music] [Music] we can think of the atmosphere as a mix of all sorts of gases that surrounds our planet some gases that humans produce can have bad effects on the planet including changing the climate and weather many of the human produced gases are called greenhouse gases these are gases that trap heat and energy from the Sun hi my name is Eric I'm an atmospheric scientist I study climate and greenhouse gases my group's research we really try to understand what's impact in the atmosphere and how that impacts climate Eric and his team study the atmosphere and measure the levels of gases that make it up including greenhouse gases the goals are to better understand where harmful gases are coming from but first they have to collect gases in the atmosphere and to do this they collect samples of air using special tools our instruments are designed to measure the contents of the atmosphere much like weather station would measure wind or rainfall or snowfall our instruments are designed to measure the molecules the components of the air that were actually in these instruments are able to take snapshots of the amount of different gases in the atmosphere at a given time which helps scientists investigate sources of greenhouse gases but since Eric and his team are thinking about the atmosphere they have an interesting approach to collecting their samples we have instrumentation that will put in different places sometimes we'll put it on an airplane and we'll actually fly the airplane around to different regions that were interested in studying the sources will collect air into inlets on the side of the airplane and actually measure it on instruments in the airplane by collecting samples in flight they are able to identify different emission sources that may not be measurable on the ground pretty cool but how does collecting air above the ground tell us about what is happening on the ground we can think about it this bees fly around from flower to flower as they fly pollen gets attached to them if we looked at a bee after a day of flying around we would be able to tell where it had been by looking at the types of pollen it collected Eric and his team are kind of like bees they fly around collecting samples of air and the samples are able to tell us about what is in the air they spend a lot of time flying and collecting samples over farms for this project we very much want to understand the impacts of how we grow our crops on the atmosphere so in order to grow crops you need to plant seeds you might put quite a lot of fertilizer down a lot of the nutrients from fertilizer going to the growing of the crops but not all of the nutrients make their way into the crops and the number of them are lost to the atmosphere by focusing on flying over farms they are able to tell if the fertilizers that farmers are using are good or bad for the atmosphere as we get towards answers we can help inform farmers on what our optimal practices to have them both get their best crop yields but minimize the losses to the atmosphere but their research doesn't just stop at farms they also fly over cities and other areas or fly downwind of cities to try to understand how much is being emitted from all the cars and vehicles in the city how much is coming out of landfills and power plants this research is important because in order to understand how the atmosphere is changing we have to understand what is making it change this research helps us determine where the problem is so we can fix it but don't let just the scientist do it all themselves you can help reduce your impact on the earth too so if one is concerned about what impacts you have on the atmosphere there are different actions that can be taken the most important thing is to simply be cognizant and aware of what you're doing being aware of subtle things even light bulbs on leaving the TV on when you're not watching it all of those small things do add up but there's also simply power being aware of the problem and then collective action that can come out of that do you want to be a scientist like Eric and his team try making your own sampling device [Music]",

Human activity is the principal cause.\nEarth's climate has changed throughout history. Just in the last 800,000 years, there have been eight cycles of ice ages and warmer periods, with the end of the last ice age about 11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era \u2014 and of human civilization. Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth\u2019s orbit that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives.\nThe current warming trend is different because it is clearly the result of human activities since the mid-1800s, and is proceeding at a rate not seen over many recent millennia.1 It is undeniable that human activities have produced the atmospheric gases that have trapped more of the Sun\u2019s energy in the Earth system. This extra energy has warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land, and widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred.\nEarth-orbiting satellites and new technologies have helped scientists see the big picture, collecting many different types of information about our planet and its climate all over the world. These data, collected over many years, reveal the signs and patterns of a changing climate.\nScientists demonstrated the heat-trapping nature of carbon dioxide and other gases in the mid-19th century.2 Many of the science instruments NASA uses to study our climate focus on how these gases affect the movement of infrared radiation through the atmosphere. From the measured impacts of increases in these gases, there is no question that increased greenhouse gas levels warm Earth in response.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nIce cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that Earth\u2019s climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly 10 times faster than the average rate of warming after an ice age. Carbon dioxide from human activities is increasing about 250 times faster than it did from natural sources after the last Ice Age.3\nThe planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and other human activities.4 Most of the warming occurred in the past 40 years, with the seven most recent years being the warmest. The years 2016 and 2020 are tied for the warmest year on record.5 Image credit: Ashwin Kumar, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic.\nThe ocean has absorbed much of this increased heat, with the top 100 meters (about 328 feet) of ocean showing warming of 0.67 degrees Fahrenheit (0.33 degrees Celsius) since 1969.6 Earth stores 90% of the extra energy in the ocean. Image credit: Kelsey Roberts/USGS\nThe Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass. Data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment show Greenland lost an average of 279 billion tons of ice per year between 1993 and 2019, while Antarctica lost about 148 billion tons of ice per year.7 Image: The Antarctic Peninsula, Credit: NASA\nGlaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world \u2014 including in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska, and Africa.8 Image: Miles Glacier, Alaska Image credit: NASA\nSatellite observations reveal that the amount of spring snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere has decreased over the past five decades and the snow is melting earlier.9 Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\nGlobal sea level rose about 8 inches (20 centimeters) in the last century.

The sampler is designed to remove excess water vapor from the sampled air and compress it without contamination into ~1-liter volumes. These flasks are analyzed at the NOAA\u2019s Global Monitoring Division laboratory for trace gasses and at the INSTAR\u2019s Staple Isotope Lab laboratory for isotopes of methane. More than 60 trace gases found in the global atmosphere can be measured at mole fractions that range from parts-per-million (10-6), e.g., carbon dioxide, down to parts-per-quadrillion (10-15), e.g., HFC-365mfc. The chemical species monitored include N2O, SF6, H2, CS2, OCS, CO2, CH4, CO, CFCs, HCFCs, HFCs, Solvents, Methyl Halides, Hydrocarbons and Perfluorocarbons.\nMedusa collects 32 cryogenically dried, flow and pressure controlled samples per flight. The samples are collected by an automated sampler into 1.5 L glass flasks that integrate over 25-s (1 e-fold) periods. Medusa provides discretely-sampled comparisons for onboard in situ O2/N2 ratio and CO2 measurements and unique measurements of Ar/N2 and 13C, 14C, and 18O isotopologues of CO2. The complementary measurements allow ground-truthing of onboard instrument measurements in a laboratory setting, where analysis conditions can often be more stringently controlled and carefully monitored. Isotope and argon measurements can provide additional information about land and ocean controls over the carbon cycle, and about the age and source of the air sampled.\nMedusa consists of an onboard computer, two pressure controllers, two pumps, three multi-position selector valves, and a host of other hardware that control and direct the air samples. All air is dried by passing it through traps immersed in a -78 C dry ice bath, adjusted to match atmospheric pressure at sea level, and then automatically isolated in a flask. Medusa flasks are analyzed on a sector-magnet mass spectrometer and a LiCor non-dispersive infrared CO2 analyzer by the Scripps O2 Program at Scripps Institution of Oceanography.\n32 samples/flight (ER-2); 50 samples/flight (WB57); 90 samples/flight (Global Hawk)\nUpdated control system with remote control capability\nFill times \u201314 km 30 \u2013 40 sec \u201316 km 40 \u2013 50 sec \u201318 km 50 \u2013 60 sec \u201320 km 100 \u2013 120 sec (estimated)\nAnalysis in UM lab: GC/MS; GC/FID; GC/ECD\nThe Whole Air Sampler (WAS) collects samples from airborne platforms for detailed analysis of a wide range of trace gases. The compounds that are typically measured from the WAS includes trace gases with sources from industrial midlatitude emissions, from biomass burning, and from the marine boundary layer, with certain compounds (e.g. organic nitrates) that have a unique source in the equatorial surface ocean. The use of a broad suite of tracers with different sources and lifetimes provides powerful diagnostic information on air mass history and chemical processing that currently is only available from measurements from whole air samples. Previous deployments of the whole air sampler have shown that the sampling and analytical procedures employed by our group are capable of accessing the wide range of mixing ratios at sufficient precision to be used for tracer studies. Thus, routine measurement of species, such as methyl iodide, at <= 0.1 x 10-12 mole fraction, or NMHC at levels of a few x 10-12 mole fraction are possible. In addition to the tracer aspects of the whole air sampler measurements, we measure a full suite of halocarbon species that provide information on the role of short-lived halocarbons in the tropical UT/LS region, on halogen budgets in the UT/LS region, and on continuing increasing temporal trends of HFCs (such as 134a), HCFCs (such as HCFC 141b), PFCs (such as C2F6), as well as declining levels of some of the major CFCs and halogenated solvents. The measurements of those species that are changing rapidly in the troposphere also give direct indications of the age and origin of air entering the stratosphere.\nThe UC-Irvine research group collected whole air samples aboard the NASA DC-8 aircraft during the summer 2019 NASA Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments Experiment - Air Quality (FIREX-AQ) field mission. More than 70 trace gases were identified and quantified at our Irvine laboratory, including C2-C10 NMHCs, C1-C2 halocarbons, C1-C5 alkyl nitrates, and selected sulfur compounds using our established technique of airborne whole air sampling followed by laboratory analysis using gas chromatography (GC) with flame ionization detection (FID), electron capture detection (ECD), and mass spectrometric detection (MSD). Our experimental procedures build on those that have been successfully employed for numerous prior NASA field missions, for example PEM Tropics A and B, TRACE-P, INTEX-A and B, ARCTAS, DC-3, SEAC4RS, ATom, KORUS-AQ, FIREX-AQ, and SARP.\nPage Last Updated: April 22, 2017\nPage Editor: Brad Bulger\nNASA Official: Mihailo Derek Rutovic\nWebsite Issues: Contact Us\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Human activity is the principal cause.\n\nFull Page Content:\nThere is unequivocal evidence that Earth is warming at an unprecedented rate. Human activity is the principal cause.\nEarth's climate has changed throughout history. Just in the last 800,000 years, there have been eight cycles of ice ages and warmer periods, with the end of the last ice age about 11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era \u2014 and of human civilization. Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth\u2019s orbit that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives.\nThe current warming trend is different because it is clearly the result of human activities since the mid-1800s, and is proceeding at a rate not seen over many recent millennia.1 It is undeniable that human activities have produced the atmospheric gases that have trapped more of the Sun\u2019s energy in the Earth system. This extra energy has warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land, and widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred.\nEarth-orbiting satellites and new technologies have helped scientists see the big picture, collecting many different types of information about our planet and its climate all over the world. These data, collected over many years, reveal the signs and patterns of a changing climate.\nScientists demonstrated the heat-trapping nature of carbon dioxide and other gases in the mid-19th century.2 Many of the science instruments NASA uses to study our climate focus on how these gases affect the movement of infrared radiation through the atmosphere. From the measured impacts of increases in these gases, there is no question that increased greenhouse gas levels warm Earth in response.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nIce cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that Earth\u2019s climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly 10 times faster than the average rate of warming after an ice age. Carbon dioxide from human activities is increasing about 250 times faster than it did from natural sources after the last Ice Age.3\nThe planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and other human activities.4 Most of the warming occurred in the past 40 years, with the seven most recent years being the warmest. The years 2016 and 2020 are tied for the warmest year on record.5 Image credit: Ashwin Kumar, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic.\nThe ocean has absorbed much of this increased heat, with the top 100 meters (about 328 feet) of ocean showing warming of 0.67 degrees Fahrenheit (0.33 degrees Celsius) since 1969.6 Earth stores 90% of the extra energy in the ocean. Image credit: Kelsey Roberts/USGS\nThe Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass. Data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment show Greenland lost an average of 279 billion tons of ice per year between 1993 and 2019, while Antarctica lost about 148 billion tons of ice per year.7 Image: The Antarctic Peninsula, Credit: NASA\nGlaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world \u2014 including in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska, and Africa.8 Image: Miles Glacier, Alaska Image credit: NASA\nSatellite observations reveal that the amount of spring snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere has decreased over the past five decades and the snow is melting earlier.9 Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\nGlobal sea level rose about 8 inches (20 centimeters) in the last century.

Collectively ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nEmissions of several important greenhouse gases that result from human activity have increased substantially since large-scale industrialization began in the mid-1800s. Most of these human-caused (anthropogenic) greenhouse gas emissions were carbon dioxide (CO2) from burning fossil fuels.\nConcentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere are naturally regulated by many processes that are part of the global carbon cycle. The flux, or movement, of carbon between the atmosphere and the earth's land and oceans is dominated by natural processes such as plant photosynthesis. Although these natural processes can absorb some of the anthropogenic CO2 emissions produced each year, starting in about 1950, CO2 emissions began exceeding the capacity of these processes to absorb carbon.\nThis imbalance between greenhouse gas emissions and the ability for natural processes to absorb those emissions has resulted in a continued increase in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. Concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere in 2022 were about 1.5 times greater than the concentrations in 1850.\nClick to enlarge\nScientists know with virtual certainty that high levels of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere tend to warm the planet. In computer-based models, rising concentrations of greenhouse gases result in a rising average surface temperature of the earth over time. Rising temperatures may produce changes in precipitation patterns, storm severity, and sea level. Collectively, this phenomena is commonly referred to as climate change.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggests that the earth's climate warmed by an estimated 0.92 degrees Centigrade (1.66 degrees Fahrenheit) between 1880 and 2012 1 and that human activity is likely an important driving factor. The IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report (Chapter 3: Human Influence on the Climate System) states, \"It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land since pre-industrial times.\"\ndid you know\nIn 2022, fossil fuels were the source of about 83% of U.S. primary energy consumption, 93% of total U.S. CO2, and 74% of total gross U.S. greenhouse gas emissions resulting from human activity.2\nThe report further states, \"The likely range of human-induced warming in global-mean surface air temperature in 2010\u20132019 relative to 1850\u20131900 is 0.8\u00b0C\u20131.3\u00b0C.\" The IPCC concluded that the increasing concentration of the major greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide) \u201care unprecedented over at least the last 800,000 years.\u201d The IPCC ties this rise directly to human activity.\nLast updated: June 18, 2024.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The air we want to measure is sent into a small chamber, and an infrared light at a ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nTo accurately measure greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the field, scientists primarily rely on four categories of tools: nondispersive infrared (NDIR) spectroscopy, cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS), flux-based instruments like eddy covariance towers and flux chambers, and remote sensing platforms including satellites and drones.\nEach method leverages the unique way GHG molecules absorb specific wavelengths of infrared light\u2014creating identifiable \u201cspectral fingerprints\u201d\u2014to detect and quantify these gases in the atmosphere, often in parts per million or billion. This is how we know that CO\u2082 concentrations reached 426.89 ppm in May 2024, and methane levels hover around 1.92 ppm, according to NOAA and Scripps.\nTable of Contents\nGreenhouse gases are invisible, odorless, and present in minute concentrations\u2014but their impacts on the climate are immense. Since the 1994 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the global goal has been to stabilize GHG concentrations and avoid dangerous climate disruption.\nDespite international agreements like the Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement, concentrations of CO\u2082, CH\u2084, and N\u2082O continue to rise, except for chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which are declining due to the 1987 Montreal Protocol.\nHere are 2023 global averages:\nTo track progress, identify sources, and enforce policies, scientists need accurate, real-time, and large-scale GHG measurement tools.\nNDIR spectroscopy is one of the oldest and most widely used techniques for measuring GHGs, particularly CO\u2082. It works by passing infrared light through an air sample and measuring how much of the light is absorbed at specific wavelengths. A filter ensures that only wavelengths absorbed by the target gas\u2014such as 4.26 microns for CO\u2082\u2014reach the detector. The more gas present, the more light is absorbed, which allows the instrument to quantify the concentration.\nNDIR was the method used by Charles David Keeling in 1958 to begin monitoring atmospheric CO\u2082 levels at Mauna Loa Observatory. His data series, known as the Keeling Curve, showed for the first time that CO\u2082 levels were steadily rising, as noted by ACS.\nIn 1958, CO\u2082 concentration was 313 parts per million (ppm). As of May 2024, the concentration had increased to 426.89 ppm\u2014a 36% rise. NDIR remains a standard tool in many monitoring stations around the world due to its robustness and reliability, although newer methods offer higher sensitivity.\nCRDS is a more modern technique that allows for extremely sensitive detection of GHGs, even at very low concentrations. It involves a laser tuned to a gas-specific wavelength and a highly reflective chamber.\nWhen the laser is turned off, the light continues to bounce between the mirrors thousands of times, gradually diminishing in intensity. The rate of this \u201cring-down\u201d is affected by the presence of GHGs in the chamber, which absorb some of the light. Faster decay means higher concentrations.\nCRDS instruments require only small amounts of calibration gas, making them ideal for long-term field use. They are now widely deployed by organizations like NOAA and Scripps Institution of Oceanography.\nAccording to Science Daily, CRDS sensors have been used to monitor urban emissions in Los Angeles and Washington D.C., where they detected measurable reductions in CO\u2082 during the COVID-19 pandemic. CRDS can also distinguish between carbon isotopes, helping identify how much CO\u2082 in the air comes from fossil fuels versus natural sources.\nEddy covariance is a micrometeorological method used to measure the exchange of gases between the land surface and the atmosphere. Towers equipped with 3D sonic anemometers and fast-response gas analyzers measure vertical wind speed and GHG concentrations at high frequencies (e.g., 10\u201320 times per second) as noted by Copernicus.\nThis allows scientists to calculate the net flux of gases like CO\u2082 and CH\u2084 over time.\nThese towers are widely deployed in ecosystems such as forests, wetlands, and grasslands to understand how these environments act as carbon sources or sinks. Data from eddy covariance networks are crucial for validating climate models and informing land-use policy.\nUnlike point measurements, this method provides continuous, real-time data over large areas, though it requires significant infrastructure and data processing.\nFlux chambers are portable devices placed over soil, vegetation, or water surfaces to measure GHG emissions from specific sources. They enclose a known volume of air and track how gas concentrations change over time.\nBy measuring the rate at which gases like CH\u2084 and N\u2082O accumulate inside the chamber, researchers can estimate the emission rate from the underlying surface.\nFlux chambers are commonly used in agriculture to study emissions from fertilized fields, manure storage, and rice paddies.\nThey are also used in wetlands, landfills, and other environments where emissions are localized. While easy to deploy and relatively inexpensive, they measure only small areas and can disrupt natural conditions if not used carefully.\nSatellites provide global coverage of GHG concentrations by measuring sunlight that has been reflected off Earth\u2019s surface and passed through the atmosphere.\nInstruments aboard satellites like NASA\u2019s Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) and ESA\u2019s Sentinel-5P (with TROPOMI) use spectroscopy to analyze which wavelengths are absorbed by gases in the atmospheric column, according to eoportal. This allows for the detection of CO\u2082, CH\u2084, and other gases over broad areas.\nSatellites are especially useful for identifying large emission sources, known as \u201csuper-emitters,\u201d such as oil and gas fields or large landfills. They also provide long-term trend data that helps verify national emissions inventories.\nHowever, they cannot directly measure emissions at the ground level and rely on complex models and reference data for calibration. Despite these limitations, satellite data have shown that landfills and fossil fuel infrastructure in the U.S. may be emitting sign\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

It prevents the heat from escaping back into space at night. This ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nEmissions of several important greenhouse gases that result from human activity have increased substantially since large-scale industrialization began in the mid-1800s. Most of these human-caused (anthropogenic) greenhouse gas emissions were carbon dioxide (CO2) from burning fossil fuels.\nConcentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere are naturally regulated by many processes that are part of the global carbon cycle. The flux, or movement, of carbon between the atmosphere and the earth's land and oceans is dominated by natural processes such as plant photosynthesis. Although these natural processes can absorb some of the anthropogenic CO2 emissions produced each year, starting in about 1950, CO2 emissions began exceeding the capacity of these processes to absorb carbon.\nThis imbalance between greenhouse gas emissions and the ability for natural processes to absorb those emissions has resulted in a continued increase in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. Concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere in 2022 were about 1.5 times greater than the concentrations in 1850.\nClick to enlarge\nScientists know with virtual certainty that high levels of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere tend to warm the planet. In computer-based models, rising concentrations of greenhouse gases result in a rising average surface temperature of the earth over time. Rising temperatures may produce changes in precipitation patterns, storm severity, and sea level. Collectively, this phenomena is commonly referred to as climate change.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggests that the earth's climate warmed by an estimated 0.92 degrees Centigrade (1.66 degrees Fahrenheit) between 1880 and 2012 1 and that human activity is likely an important driving factor. The IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report (Chapter 3: Human Influence on the Climate System) states, \"It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land since pre-industrial times.\"\ndid you know\nIn 2022, fossil fuels were the source of about 83% of U.S. primary energy consumption, 93% of total U.S. CO2, and 74% of total gross U.S. greenhouse gas emissions resulting from human activity.2\nThe report further states, \"The likely range of human-induced warming in global-mean surface air temperature in 2010\u20132019 relative to 1850\u20131900 is 0.8\u00b0C\u20131.3\u00b0C.\" The IPCC concluded that the increasing concentration of the major greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide) \u201care unprecedented over at least the last 800,000 years.\u201d The IPCC ties this rise directly to human activity.\nLast updated: June 18, 2024.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The sensing mechanism of the instrument can be hair (hair hygrometer), a plate coated with carbon (electrical hygrometer), or an infrared sensor (infrared hygrometer).\nElement: Humidity\nInstrument: Psychrometer\nA hygrometer composed of two similar thermometers. The bulb of one thermometer is kept wet (by means of a thin, wet cloth wick) so that the cooling that results from evaporation makes it register a lower temperature than the dry-bulb thermometer. When readings are taken simultaneously, it is possible (with the use of psychrometric tables) to determine the relative humidity and dew-point temperature of the air.\nElement: Temperature and Humidity\nInstrument: Thermo-hygrograph\nAn instrument which records the environmental temperature and humidity at the same time, usually both continually.\nElement: Temperature and Humidity\nInstrument: Stevenson Screen\nA standard shelter for housing four types of thermometers: dry, wet, maximum and minimum. The screen shields the instruments from direct sunlight.\nElement: Temperature\nInstrument: Thermometer\nMeasures how hot or cold the atmosphere is in (Celsius (C) or Fahrenheit (F), or Kelvin (K)). A traditional thermometer consists of mercury, red spirit or green spirit in a glass tube and operates on the principle that the liquid expands more than the glass does when heated.\nElement: Temperature\nInstrument: Maximum Temperature\nMaximum temperature has historically been measured with a mercury-in-glass thermometer which has a constriction in the neck of the thermometer tube. As the air temperature rises mercury is forced past the constriction. However, as the temperature falls the constriction prevents the mercury from returning to the bulb of the thermometer. The height of mercury in the tube remains at that reached at the hottest time of day. The thermometer is reset by gentle shaking.\nElement: Temperature\nInstrument: Minimum Temperature\nAlcohol-in-glass thermometers containing a moveable index are used to manually record minimum temperatures. When the temperature falls, the liquid and index move down the column, but when the temperature rises the index remains in the lowest position while the liquid expands up the tube. The position of the index indicates the lowest temperature reached since the last reset - which is achieved by tilting the thermometer, bulb end upwards.\nElement: Temperature\nInstrument: Dry Bulb Temperature\nusually referred to as \u2018air temperature\u2019.

Remote ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nTo accurately measure greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the field, scientists primarily rely on four categories of tools: nondispersive infrared (NDIR) spectroscopy, cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS), flux-based instruments like eddy covariance towers and flux chambers, and remote sensing platforms including satellites and drones.\nEach method leverages the unique way GHG molecules absorb specific wavelengths of infrared light\u2014creating identifiable \u201cspectral fingerprints\u201d\u2014to detect and quantify these gases in the atmosphere, often in parts per million or billion. This is how we know that CO\u2082 concentrations reached 426.89 ppm in May 2024, and methane levels hover around 1.92 ppm, according to NOAA and Scripps.\nTable of Contents\nGreenhouse gases are invisible, odorless, and present in minute concentrations\u2014but their impacts on the climate are immense. Since the 1994 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the global goal has been to stabilize GHG concentrations and avoid dangerous climate disruption.\nDespite international agreements like the Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement, concentrations of CO\u2082, CH\u2084, and N\u2082O continue to rise, except for chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which are declining due to the 1987 Montreal Protocol.\nHere are 2023 global averages:\nTo track progress, identify sources, and enforce policies, scientists need accurate, real-time, and large-scale GHG measurement tools.\nNDIR spectroscopy is one of the oldest and most widely used techniques for measuring GHGs, particularly CO\u2082. It works by passing infrared light through an air sample and measuring how much of the light is absorbed at specific wavelengths. A filter ensures that only wavelengths absorbed by the target gas\u2014such as 4.26 microns for CO\u2082\u2014reach the detector. The more gas present, the more light is absorbed, which allows the instrument to quantify the concentration.\nNDIR was the method used by Charles David Keeling in 1958 to begin monitoring atmospheric CO\u2082 levels at Mauna Loa Observatory. His data series, known as the Keeling Curve, showed for the first time that CO\u2082 levels were steadily rising, as noted by ACS.\nIn 1958, CO\u2082 concentration was 313 parts per million (ppm). As of May 2024, the concentration had increased to 426.89 ppm\u2014a 36% rise. NDIR remains a standard tool in many monitoring stations around the world due to its robustness and reliability, although newer methods offer higher sensitivity.\nCRDS is a more modern technique that allows for extremely sensitive detection of GHGs, even at very low concentrations. It involves a laser tuned to a gas-specific wavelength and a highly reflective chamber.\nWhen the laser is turned off, the light continues to bounce between the mirrors thousands of times, gradually diminishing in intensity. The rate of this \u201cring-down\u201d is affected by the presence of GHGs in the chamber, which absorb some of the light. Faster decay means higher concentrations.\nCRDS instruments require only small amounts of calibration gas, making them ideal for long-term field use. They are now widely deployed by organizations like NOAA and Scripps Institution of Oceanography.\nAccording to Science Daily, CRDS sensors have been used to monitor urban emissions in Los Angeles and Washington D.C., where they detected measurable reductions in CO\u2082 during the COVID-19 pandemic. CRDS can also distinguish between carbon isotopes, helping identify how much CO\u2082 in the air comes from fossil fuels versus natural sources.\nEddy covariance is a micrometeorological method used to measure the exchange of gases between the land surface and the atmosphere. Towers equipped with 3D sonic anemometers and fast-response gas analyzers measure vertical wind speed and GHG concentrations at high frequencies (e.g., 10\u201320 times per second) as noted by Copernicus.\nThis allows scientists to calculate the net flux of gases like CO\u2082 and CH\u2084 over time.\nThese towers are widely deployed in ecosystems such as forests, wetlands, and grasslands to understand how these environments act as carbon sources or sinks. Data from eddy covariance networks are crucial for validating climate models and informing land-use policy.\nUnlike point measurements, this method provides continuous, real-time data over large areas, though it requires significant infrastructure and data processing.\nFlux chambers are portable devices placed over soil, vegetation, or water surfaces to measure GHG emissions from specific sources. They enclose a known volume of air and track how gas concentrations change over time.\nBy measuring the rate at which gases like CH\u2084 and N\u2082O accumulate inside the chamber, researchers can estimate the emission rate from the underlying surface.\nFlux chambers are commonly used in agriculture to study emissions from fertilized fields, manure storage, and rice paddies.\nThey are also used in wetlands, landfills, and other environments where emissions are localized. While easy to deploy and relatively inexpensive, they measure only small areas and can disrupt natural conditions if not used carefully.\nSatellites provide global coverage of GHG concentrations by measuring sunlight that has been reflected off Earth\u2019s surface and passed through the atmosphere.\nInstruments aboard satellites like NASA\u2019s Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) and ESA\u2019s Sentinel-5P (with TROPOMI) use spectroscopy to analyze which wavelengths are absorbed by gases in the atmospheric column, according to eoportal. This allows for the detection of CO\u2082, CH\u2084, and other gases over broad areas.\nSatellites are especially useful for identifying large emission sources, known as \u201csuper-emitters,\u201d such as oil and gas fields or large landfills. They also provide long-term trend data that helps verify national emissions inventories.\nHowever, they cannot directly measure emissions at the ground level and rely on complex models and reference data for calibration. Despite these limitations, satellite data have shown that landfills and fossil fuel infrastructure in the U.S. may be emitting sign\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The extent of the loss depends on weather conditions, the type of ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nFor centuries, keeping farmland in production has been critical to the economy and our nation\u2019s food security system. But increasingly, the State of California is recognizing the importance of preserving this land to help fight climate change, as noted in the 2030 Natural and Working Lands Climate Change Implementation Plan. Farmland offers open spaces and habitat for wildlife. It provides a buffer against development, which would mean more streets, traffic and greenhouse gas emissions.\nA big key to farm efficiency and a healthy environment isthe increasingly sophisticated use of fertilizers. Plants, like people, require nutrients to be healthy. By keeping plants healthy, fertilizers are responsible for strong roots, which prevents soil erosion and in turn protects green spaces and promotes biodiverse habitats.\nHealthy plants not only produce oxygen essential for all living things, but they contribute to the fight against climate change by absorbing massive amounts of carbon (CO2) from the atmosphere. A just released report by the California Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office estimates that modern fertilizers only contribute about one percent of the total greenhouse gases being emitted from all contributing urban and rural sources. However, a recent study by Stanford University estimates that healthy plants and soils absorb about 30 percent of total CO2 emitted. It is hard to imagine a more environmentally beneficial tradeoff for Californians than using fertilizers to promote healthy plants, who can then through photosynthesis convert massive amounts of CO2 into oxygen.\nWhile fertilizers are vital, there has been concerns raised about the potential contributions of nitrates leaching into groundwater aquifers. In response, California\u2019s fertilizer industry has been funding the Fertilizer Research & Education Program (FREP). Overseen by the California Department of Agriculture, for over 30 years FREP has led the country in fertilizer research and grower education to promote the agronomically sound and environmentally safe use of nitrogen products.\nIn keeping with their desire to be better environmental stewards of their land, thousands of farmers are utilizing this fertilizer industry funded program to learn how to improve the way they use water and fertilizers. The fertilizer industry is currently funding over $2,000,000 a year in grower education programs to help farmers maximize advanced management practices which will minimize potential nutrient impacts to water quality. FREP is a terrific example of a public-private partnership that is promoting best practices that allow farmers to keep their land in production while protecting the environment. Whether we are looking at water or air quality, the use of advanced fertilizers are helping to assure that agricultural contributions that impact our environment are minimized, while still maximizing the removal of greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. If California wants to continue to lead on pumping up the green in our state, fertilizers will need to play a role.\nBy Renee Pinel\nShare\nFollow Us\n\u00a9 2020 Western Plant Health.

The use of a broad suite of tracers with different sources and lifetimes provides powerful diagnostic information on air mass history and chemical processing that currently is only available from measurements from whole air samples. Previous deployments of the whole air sampler have shown that the sampling and analytical procedures employed by our group are capable of accessing the wide range of mixing ratios at sufficient precision to be used for tracer studies. Thus, routine measurement of species, such as methyl iodide, at <= 0.1 x 10-12 mole fraction, or NMHC at levels of a few x 10-12 mole fraction are possible. In addition to the tracer aspects of the whole air sampler measurements, we measure a full suite of halocarbon species that provide information on the role of short-lived halocarbons in the tropical UT/LS region, on halogen budgets in the UT/LS region, and on continuing increasing temporal trends of HFCs (such as 134a), HCFCs (such as HCFC 141b), PFCs (such as C2F6), as well as declining levels of some of the major CFCs and halogenated solvents. The measurements of those species that are changing rapidly in the troposphere also give direct indications of the age and origin of air entering the stratosphere.\nThe UC-Irvine research group collected whole air samples aboard the NASA DC-8 aircraft during the summer 2019 NASA Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments Experiment - Air Quality (FIREX-AQ) field mission.

If less energy is collected, the climate will become cooler. Understanding this ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nClimate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. Such shifts can be natural, due to changes in the sun\u2019s activity or large volcanic eruptions. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.\nBurning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun\u2019s heat and raising temperatures.\nThe main greenhouse gases that are causing climate change include carbon dioxide and methane. These come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example. Clearing land and cutting down forests can also release carbon dioxide. Agriculture, oil and gas operations are major sources of methane emissions. Energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main sectors causing greenhouse gases.\nClimate scientists have showed that humans are responsible for virtually all global heating over the last 200 years. Human activities like the ones mentioned above are causing greenhouse gases that are warming the world faster than at any time in at least the last two thousand years.\nThe average temperature of the Earth\u2019s surface is now about 1.42\u00b0C warmer than it was in the late 1800s-prior to the industrial revolution-and warmer than at any time in the last 100,000 years. The last decade (2015-2024) was the warmest on record, and each of the last four decades has been warmer than any previous decade since 1850.\nMany people think that climate change mainly means warmer temperatures. But temperature rise is only the beginning of the story. Because the Earth is a system where everything is connected, changes in one area can influence changes in all others.\nThe consequences of climate change include, among others, intense droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice, catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.\nClimate change can affect our health, ability to grow food, housing, safety and work. Some of us are already more vulnerable to climate impacts, such as people living in small island nations and other developing countries. Conditions like sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion have advanced to the point where entire communities have had to relocate, while protracted droughts are putting people at risk of famine. In the future, the number of people displaced by weather-related events is expected to rise.\nIn a series of UN reports, thousands of scientists and government reviewers agreed that limiting global temperature rise to no more than 1.5\u00b0C would help us avoid the worst climate impacts and maintain a liveable climate. Yet policies currently in place point to up to 2.8\u00b0C of warming by the end of the century.\nThe emissions that cause climate change come from every part of the world and affect everyone, but some countries produce much more than others. The six biggest emitters (China, the United States of America, India, the European Union, the Russian Federation, and Indonesia) together account for more than half of all global greenhouse gas emissions. By contrast, the 45 least developed countries contribute only 3 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.\nEveryone must take climate action, but people and countries creating more of the problem have a greater responsibility to act first.\nMany climate change solutions can deliver economic benefits while improving our lives and protecting the environment. We also have global frameworks and agreements to guide progress, such as the Sustainable Development Goals, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. Three broad categories of action are: cutting emissions, adapting to climate impacts and financing required adjustments.\nSwitching energy systems from fossil fuels to renewables like solar or wind will reduce the emissions driving climate change. But we have to act now. While a growing number of countries is committing to net zero emissions by 2050, emissions must be cut in half by 2030 to keep warming below 1.5\u00b0C. Achieving this means huge declines in the use of coal, oil and gas: production and consumption of all fossil fuels need to be cut by at least 30 per cent by 2030 in order to prevent catastrophic levels of climate change.\nAdapting to climate consequences protects people, homes, businesses, livelihoods, infrastructure and natural ecosystems. It covers current impacts and those likely in the future. Adaptation will be required everywhere but must be prioritized now for the most vulnerable people with the fewest resources to cope with climate hazards. The rate of return can be high. Early warning systems for disasters, for instance, save lives and property, and can deliver benefits up to 10 times the initial cost.\nClimate action requires significant financial investments by governments and businesses. But climate inaction is vastly more expensive. One critical step is for developed countries to support developing countries so they can adapt and move towards greener economies.\nTo get familiar with some of the more technical terms used in connection with climate change, consult the Climate Dictionary.\nClimate change is a hot topic \u2013 with myths and falsehoods circulating widely.

But increasingly, the State of California is recognizing the importance of preserving this land to help fight climate change, as noted in the 2030 Natural and Working Lands Climate Change Implementation Plan. Farmland offers open spaces and habitat for wildlife. It provides a buffer against development, which would mean more streets, traffic and greenhouse gas emissions.\nA big key to farm efficiency and a healthy environment isthe increasingly sophisticated use of fertilizers. Plants, like people, require nutrients to be healthy. By keeping plants healthy, fertilizers are responsible for strong roots, which prevents soil erosion and in turn protects green spaces and promotes biodiverse habitats.\nHealthy plants not only produce oxygen essential for all living things, but they contribute to the fight against climate change by absorbing massive amounts of carbon (CO2) from the atmosphere. A just released report by the California Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office estimates that modern fertilizers only contribute about one percent of the total greenhouse gases being emitted from all contributing urban and rural sources. However, a recent study by Stanford University estimates that healthy plants and soils absorb about 30 percent of total CO2 emitted. It is hard to imagine a more environmentally beneficial tradeoff for Californians than using fertilizers to promote healthy plants, who can then through photosynthesis convert massive amounts of CO2 into oxygen.\nWhile fertilizers are vital, there has been concerns raised about the potential contributions of nitrates leaching into groundwater aquifers. In response, California\u2019s fertilizer industry has been funding the Fertilizer Research & Education Program (FREP). Overseen by the California Department of Agriculture, for over 30 years FREP has led the country in fertilizer research and grower education to promote the agronomically sound and environmentally safe use of nitrogen products.\nIn keeping with their desire to be better environmental stewards of their land, thousands of farmers are utilizing this fertilizer industry funded program to learn how to improve the way they use water and fertilizers. The fertilizer industry is currently funding over $2,000,000 a year in grower education programs to help farmers maximize advanced management practices which will minimize potential nutrient impacts to water quality. FREP is a terrific example of a public-private partnership that is promoting best practices that allow farmers to keep their land in production while protecting the environment. Whether we are looking at water or air quality, the use of advanced fertilizers are helping to assure that agricultural contributions that impact our environment are minimized, while still maximizing the removal of greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. If California wants to continue to lead on pumping up the green in our state, fertilizers will need to play a role.\nBy Renee Pinel\nShare\nFollow Us\n\u00a9 2020 Western Plant Health.

    "input_prompt": "Claim:\nUnderstanding what is making the atmosphere change is crucial for addressing climate issues.\n\nArticle Title:\nEvidence - NASA Science\n\nGoogle Search Snippet:\nThere is unequivocal evidence that Earth is warming at an unprecedented rate. Human activity is the principal cause.\n\nFull Page Content:\nClimate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. Such shifts can be natural, due to changes in the sun\u2019s activity or large volcanic eruptions. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.\nBurning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun\u2019s heat and raising temperatures.\nThe main greenhouse gases that are causing climate change include carbon dioxide and methane. These come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example. Clearing land and cutting down forests can also release carbon dioxide. Agriculture, oil and gas operations are major sources of methane emissions. Energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main sectors causing greenhouse gases.\nClimate scientists have showed that humans are responsible for virtually all global heating over the last 200 years. Human activities like the ones mentioned above are causing greenhouse gases that are warming the world faster than at any time in at least the last two thousand years.\nThe average temperature of the Earth\u2019s surface is now about 1.42\u00b0C warmer than it was in the late 1800s-prior to the industrial revolution-and warmer than at any time in the last 100,000 years. The last decade (2015-2024) was the warmest on record, and each of the last four decades has been warmer than any previous decade since 1850.\nMany people think that climate change mainly means warmer temperatures. But temperature rise is only the beginning of the story. Because the Earth is a system where everything is connected, changes in one area can influence changes in all others.\nThe consequences of climate change include, among others, intense droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice, catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.\nClimate change can affect our health, ability to grow food, housing, safety and work. Some of us are already more vulnerable to climate impacts, such as people living in small island nations and other developing countries. Conditions like sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion have advanced to the point where entire communities have had to relocate, while protracted droughts are putting people at risk of famine. In the future, the number of people displaced by weather-related events is expected to rise.\nIn a series of UN reports, thousands of scientists and government reviewers agreed that limiting global temperature rise to no more than 1.5\u00b0C would help us avoid the worst climate impacts and maintain a liveable climate. Yet policies currently in place point to up to 2.8\u00b0C of warming by the end of the century.\nThe emissions that cause climate change come from every part of the world and affect everyone, but some countries produce much more than others. The six biggest emitters (China, the United States of America, India, the European Union, the Russian Federation, and Indonesia) together account for more than half of all global greenhouse gas emissions. By contrast, the 45 least developed countries contribute only 3 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.\nEveryone must take climate action, but people and countries creating more of the problem have a greater responsibility to act first.\nMany climate change solutions can deliver economic benefits while improving our lives and protecting the environment. We also have global frameworks and agreements to guide progress, such as the Sustainable Development Goals, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. Three broad categories of action are: cutting emissions, adapting to climate impacts and financing required adjustments.\nSwitching energy systems from fossil fuels to renewables like solar or wind will reduce the emissions driving climate change. But we have to act now. While a growing number of countries is committing to net zero emissions by 2050, emissions must be cut in half by 2030 to keep warming below 1.5\u00b0C. Achieving this means huge declines in the use of coal, oil and gas: production and consumption of all fossil fuels need to be cut by at least 30 per cent by 2030 in order to prevent catastrophic levels of climate change.\nAdapting to climate consequences protects people, homes, businesses, livelihoods, infrastructure and natural ecosystems. It covers current impacts and those likely in the future. Adaptation will be required everywhere but must be prioritized now for the most vulnerable people with the fewest resources to cope with climate hazards. The rate of return can be high. Early warning systems for disasters, for instance, save lives and property, and can deliver benefits up to 10 times the initial cost.\nClimate action requires significant financial investments by governments and businesses. But climate inaction is vastly more expensive. One critical step is for developed countries to support developing countries so they can adapt and move towards greener economies.\nTo get familiar with some of the more technical terms used in connection with climate change, consult the Climate Dictionary.\nClimate change is a hot topic \u2013 with myths and falsehoods circulating widely.

This instrument was designed for operation on uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) but has also flown on other platforms, such as the NSF/NCAR GV, the NASA DC-8, and the NASA ER-2 aircraft. I work on airborne field projects to study atmospheric composition, dynamics (transport), and climate processes. Besides field work, I am involved with instrument design, building, and maintenance; data analysis, archiving data, and publication of results; and coordination and collaboration with the Water Vapor and Ozone Division within the NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory (GML) as well as other colleagues in GML and the NOAA Chemical Sciences Laboratory.\nMy academic training was in the field of chemistry, and I received my Ph.D. in physical chemistry in 1989. I began work in atmospheric science as a postdoctoral researcher and scientist with Dr. James Anderson, working on water vapor, ozone, and stratospheric transport, primarily on a series of missions on the NASA ER-2 aircraft in the 1990\u2019s. After working as a research scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and as a Program Director for Atmospheric Chemistry at the National Science Foundation, I came to NOAA in 2009.\nSince then, I have participated in the HIPPO and ATom projects to study the distribution, chemistry, and transport of atmospheric trace gases over the Pacific ocean from the NSF GV aircraft and the Pacific and Atlantic with the NASA DC-8, respectively. From 2010-2014, I operated the UCATS instrument on the NASA/NOAA Global Hawk UAS from California and Guam during GloPac and the Airborne Tropical TRopopause EXperiment (ATTREX). Highlights of ATTREX include the use of trace gases to determine the origin and transport of air in the Tropical Tropopause Layer (TTL), and observations of ozone over the tropical Pacific. In 2019-2022, we rebuilt the UCATS instrument to measure a larger suite of gases, including chlorine- and bromine-containing compounds such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halon-1211, and flew it on the ER-2 aircraft over North America as part of the Dynamics and Chemistry of the Summer Stratosphere (DCOTSS) Mission. I am currently analyzing data from the mission to determine the chlorine and bromine budgets of the midlatitude lower stratosphere. In 2023, we participated in the NOAA Stratospheric Aerosol processes, Budget and Radiative Effects (SABRE) project in the Arctic winter, in order to better understand stratospheric aerosols and possible effects from natural and anthropogenic perturbations to aerosol distributions. Long-lived trace gases such as nitrous oxide (N2O) can help show whether air has been influenced by the Polar Vortex, and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is used to determine age of air; these are among the gases measured by UCATS. Analysis of SABRE data and preparation for future SABRE activities is ongoing, with plans for a deployment to the tropics in 2025.\nGlobal Monitoring Laboratory \u00bb U.S. Department of Commerce \u00bb National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration \u00bb NOAA Research\nPrivacy Policy | Accessibility | Disclaimer | Disclaimer for External Links | FOIA | Usa.gov\nSite Contents Contact Us | Webmaster Take Our Survey\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Content is not being updated or maintained, and some links may no longer work.\nThe modern record of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels began with observations recorded at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. This graph shows the station's monthly average carbon dioxide measurements since 1958 in parts per million (ppm). The seasonal cycle of highs and lows (small peaks and valleys) is driven by Northern Hemisphere summer vegetation growth, which reduces atmospheric carbon dioxide, and winter decay, which increases it. The long-term trend of rising carbon dioxide levels is driven by human activities. At Mauna Loa, the highest monthly value each year occurs in May. In May 2024, carbon dioxide hit just under 427 ppm\u2014a new record. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on Mauna Loa monthly mean data from NOAA Global Monitoring Lab.\nBased on the annual analysis from NOAA\u2019s Global Monitoring Lab, global average atmospheric carbon dioxide was 422.8 parts per million (\u201cppm,\u201d for short) in 2024, a new record high. The increase during 2024 was 3.75 ppm\u2014the largest one-year increase on record. At Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii (graph above), where the modern carbon dioxide record began in 1958, the annual average carbon dioxide in 2024 was 424.61 ppm, also a new record.\nThe years with the largest annual carbon dioxide growth tend to be associated with the strongest El Ni\u00f1os\u2014the warm phase of a natural climate pattern in the tropical Pacific\u2014which lead to high temperatures over land and sea and an expansion of global drought area. In turn, these weather conditions typically lead to less plant growth, which reduces carbon dioxide uptake, as well as increased decomposition of carbon in soil and increased carbon dioxide emissions from forest fires. Together, these impacts cause atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to rise faster than normal.\nEven though the 2023-24 El Ni\u00f1o had waned by April, record high air temperatures and drought in all of 2024, similar to those during an El Nino, were likely drivers of the large increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide in 2024. In addition to other factors, large forest fires in both the Amazon and Canada contributed to the 2024 global increase.\nCarbon dioxide concentrations are rising mostly because of the fossil fuels that people have been burning for energy since the start of the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuels like coal and oil contain the carbon from millions of years of photosynthesis\u2014the process by which plants remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. We are returning that carbon to the atmosphere in just a few hundred years. Since the middle of the 20th century, annual emissions of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels have increased every decade, from close to 11 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year in the 1960s to an estimated 37.4 billion tons in 2024 according to the Global Carbon Budget 2024.\nThe amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (blue line) has increased along with human emissions (gray line) since the start of the Industrial Revolution in 1750. Emissions rose slowly to about 5 gigatons (1 gigaton is 1 billion metric tons per year) in the mid-20th century before rapidly increasing to more than 35 billion tons per year by the end of the century. NOAA Climate.gov graph, adapted from original by Dr. Howard Diamond (NOAA ARL). Atmospheric carbon dioxide data from NOAA and ETHZ. Carbon dioxide emissions data from Our World in Data and the Global Carbon Project.\nCarbon cycle experts estimate that natural \u201csinks,\u201d including plant growth and ocean absorption, remove about half of carbon dioxide humans emit into the atmosphere from fossil fuel burning. The rest stays in the atmosphere. Every year, we are adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than natural sinks can remove, and so the total amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere goes up. The bigger the overshoot, the faster atmospheric carbon dioxide increases.\nIn the 1960s, atmospheric carbon dioxide increased by about 0.8 ppm per year on average. That growth rate doubled to an average of 1.6 ppm per year in the 1980s and 1.5 ppm per year in the 1990s. In the last decade (2015-2024), the annual increase has accelerated to 2.6 ppm per year. As a result, the annual rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide over the past 60 years is 100-200 times faster than the increase that occurred at the end of the last ice age 11,000-17,000 years ago.\nCarbon dioxide is Earth\u2019s most important long-lived greenhouse gas: a gas that absorbs and radiates heat. Unlike oxygen or nitrogen (which make up most of Earth's atmosphere), greenhouse gases absorb heat radiating from the Earth\u2019s surface and re-release it in all directions\u2014including back toward Earth\u2019s surface. Without any carbon dioxide, Earth\u2019s natural greenhouse effect would be too weak to keep the average global surface temperature above freezing.\nBy adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, people are amplifying the natural greenhouse effect, causing global temperature to rise. According to observations and analysis by the NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory, carbon dioxide alone is responsible for about 80 percent of the total heating influence of all human-produced greenhouse gases since 1990.\nAnother reason carbon dioxide is important in the Earth system is that it dissolves into the ocean like the fizz in a can of soda. It reacts with water molecules, producing carbonic acid and lowering the ocean's pH (raising its acidity). Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, the pH of the ocean's surface waters has dropped from 8.21 to 8.10. This drop in pH is called ocean acidification, and it interferes with the ability of marine life to extract calcium from sea water to build skeletons and shells.\n(left) A healthy ocean snail has a transparent shell with smoothly contoured ridges.

But increasingly, the State of California is recognizing the importance of preserving this land to help fight climate change, as noted in the 2030 Natural and Working Lands Climate Change Implementation Plan. Farmland offers open spaces and habitat for wildlife. It provides a buffer against development, which would mean more streets, traffic and greenhouse gas emissions.\nA big key to farm efficiency and a healthy environment isthe increasingly sophisticated use of fertilizers. Plants, like people, require nutrients to be healthy. By keeping plants healthy, fertilizers are responsible for strong roots, which prevents soil erosion and in turn protects green spaces and promotes biodiverse habitats.\nHealthy plants not only produce oxygen essential for all living things, but they contribute to the fight against climate change by absorbing massive amounts of carbon (CO2) from the atmosphere. A just released report by the California Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office estimates that modern fertilizers only contribute about one percent of the total greenhouse gases being emitted from all contributing urban and rural sources. However, a recent study by Stanford University estimates that healthy plants and soils absorb about 30 percent of total CO2 emitted. It is hard to imagine a more environmentally beneficial tradeoff for Californians than using fertilizers to promote healthy plants, who can then through photosynthesis convert massive amounts of CO2 into oxygen.\nWhile fertilizers are vital, there has been concerns raised about the potential contributions of nitrates leaching into groundwater aquifers. In response, California\u2019s fertilizer industry has been funding the Fertilizer Research & Education Program (FREP). Overseen by the California Department of Agriculture, for over 30 years FREP has led the country in fertilizer research and grower education to promote the agronomically sound and environmentally safe use of nitrogen products.\nIn keeping with their desire to be better environmental stewards of their land, thousands of farmers are utilizing this fertilizer industry funded program to learn how to improve the way they use water and fertilizers. The fertilizer industry is currently funding over $2,000,000 a year in grower education programs to help farmers maximize advanced management practices which will minimize potential nutrient impacts to water quality. FREP is a terrific example of a public-private partnership that is promoting best practices that allow farmers to keep their land in production while protecting the environment. Whether we are looking at water or air quality, the use of advanced fertilizers are helping to assure that agricultural contributions that impact our environment are minimized, while still maximizing the removal of greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. If California wants to continue to lead on pumping up the green in our state, fertilizers will need to play a role.\nBy Renee Pinel\nShare\nFollow Us\n\u00a9 2020 Western Plant Health.

Such shifts can be natural, due to changes in the sun\u2019s activity or large volcanic eruptions. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.\nBurning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun\u2019s heat and raising temperatures.\nThe main greenhouse gases that are causing climate change include carbon dioxide and methane. These come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example. Clearing land and cutting down forests can also release carbon dioxide. Agriculture, oil and gas operations are major sources of methane emissions. Energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main sectors causing greenhouse gases.\nClimate scientists have showed that humans are responsible for virtually all global heating over the last 200 years. Human activities like the ones mentioned above are causing greenhouse gases that are warming the world faster than at any time in at least the last two thousand years.\nThe average temperature of the Earth\u2019s surface is now about 1.42\u00b0C warmer than it was in the late 1800s-prior to the industrial revolution-and warmer than at any time in the last 100,000 years. The last decade (2015-2024) was the warmest on record, and each of the last four decades has been warmer than any previous decade since 1850.\nMany people think that climate change mainly means warmer temperatures. But temperature rise is only the beginning of the story. Because the Earth is a system where everything is connected, changes in one area can influence changes in all others.\nThe consequences of climate change include, among others, intense droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice, catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.\nClimate change can affect our health, ability to grow food, housing, safety and work. Some of us are already more vulnerable to climate impacts, such as people living in small island nations and other developing countries. Conditions like sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion have advanced to the point where entire communities have had to relocate, while protracted droughts are putting people at risk of famine. In the future, the number of people displaced by weather-related events is expected to rise.\nIn a series of UN reports, thousands of scientists and government reviewers agreed that limiting global temperature rise to no more than 1.5\u00b0C would help us avoid the worst climate impacts and maintain a liveable climate. Yet policies currently in place point to up to 2.8\u00b0C of warming by the end of the century.\nThe emissions that cause climate change come from every part of the world and affect everyone, but some countries produce much more than others. The six biggest emitters (China, the United States of America, India, the European Union, the Russian Federation, and Indonesia) together account for more than half of all global greenhouse gas emissions. By contrast, the 45 least developed countries contribute only 3 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.\nEveryone must take climate action, but people and countries creating more of the problem have a greater responsibility to act first.\nMany climate change solutions can deliver economic benefits while improving our lives and protecting the environment. We also have global frameworks and agreements to guide progress, such as the Sustainable Development Goals, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. Three broad categories of action are: cutting emissions, adapting to climate impacts and financing required adjustments.\nSwitching energy systems from fossil fuels to renewables like solar or wind will reduce the emissions driving climate change. But we have to act now. While a growing number of countries is committing to net zero emissions by 2050, emissions must be cut in half by 2030 to keep warming below 1.5\u00b0C. Achieving this means huge declines in the use of coal, oil and gas: production and consumption of all fossil fuels need to be cut by at least 30 per cent by 2030 in order to prevent catastrophic levels of climate change.\nAdapting to climate consequences protects people, homes, businesses, livelihoods, infrastructure and natural ecosystems. It covers current impacts and those likely in the future. Adaptation will be required everywhere but must be prioritized now for the most vulnerable people with the fewest resources to cope with climate hazards. The rate of return can be high. Early warning systems for disasters, for instance, save lives and property, and can deliver benefits up to 10 times the initial cost.\nClimate action requires significant financial investments by governments and businesses. But climate inaction is vastly more expensive. One critical step is for developed countries to support developing countries so they can adapt and move towards greener economies.\nTo get familiar with some of the more technical terms used in connection with climate change, consult the Climate Dictionary.\nClimate change is a hot topic \u2013 with myths and falsehoods circulating widely.

In May 2024, carbon dioxide hit just under 427 ppm\u2014a new record. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on Mauna Loa monthly mean data from NOAA Global Monitoring Lab.\nBased on the annual analysis from NOAA\u2019s Global Monitoring Lab, global average atmospheric carbon dioxide was 422.8 parts per million (\u201cppm,\u201d for short) in 2024, a new record high. The increase during 2024 was 3.75 ppm\u2014the largest one-year increase on record. At Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii (graph above), where the modern carbon dioxide record began in 1958, the annual average carbon dioxide in 2024 was 424.61 ppm, also a new record.\nThe years with the largest annual carbon dioxide growth tend to be associated with the strongest El Ni\u00f1os\u2014the warm phase of a natural climate pattern in the tropical Pacific\u2014which lead to high temperatures over land and sea and an expansion of global drought area. In turn, these weather conditions typically lead to less plant growth, which reduces carbon dioxide uptake, as well as increased decomposition of carbon in soil and increased carbon dioxide emissions from forest fires. Together, these impacts cause atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to rise faster than normal.\nEven though the 2023-24 El Ni\u00f1o had waned by April, record high air temperatures and drought in all of 2024, similar to those during an El Nino, were likely drivers of the large increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide in 2024. In addition to other factors, large forest fires in both the Amazon and Canada contributed to the 2024 global increase.\nCarbon dioxide concentrations are rising mostly because of the fossil fuels that people have been burning for energy since the start of the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuels like coal and oil contain the carbon from millions of years of photosynthesis\u2014the process by which plants remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. We are returning that carbon to the atmosphere in just a few hundred years. Since the middle of the 20th century, annual emissions of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels have increased every decade, from close to 11 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year in the 1960s to an estimated 37.4 billion tons in 2024 according to the Global Carbon Budget 2024.\nThe amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (blue line) has increased along with human emissions (gray line) since the start of the Industrial Revolution in 1750. Emissions rose slowly to about 5 gigatons (1 gigaton is 1 billion metric tons per year) in the mid-20th century before rapidly increasing to more than 35 billion tons per year by the end of the century.

The rest stays in the atmosphere. Every year, we are adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than natural sinks can remove, and so the total amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere goes up. The bigger the overshoot, the faster atmospheric carbon dioxide increases.\nIn the 1960s, atmospheric carbon dioxide increased by about 0.8 ppm per year on average. That growth rate doubled to an average of 1.6 ppm per year in the 1980s and 1.5 ppm per year in the 1990s. In the last decade (2015-2024), the annual increase has accelerated to 2.6 ppm per year. As a result, the annual rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide over the past 60 years is 100-200 times faster than the increase that occurred at the end of the last ice age 11,000-17,000 years ago.\nCarbon dioxide is Earth\u2019s most important long-lived greenhouse gas: a gas that absorbs and radiates heat.

Human activity is the principal cause.\nEarth's climate has changed throughout history. Just in the last 800,000 years, there have been eight cycles of ice ages and warmer periods, with the end of the last ice age about 11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era \u2014 and of human civilization. Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth\u2019s orbit that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives.\nThe current warming trend is different because it is clearly the result of human activities since the mid-1800s, and is proceeding at a rate not seen over many recent millennia.1 It is undeniable that human activities have produced the atmospheric gases that have trapped more of the Sun\u2019s energy in the Earth system. This extra energy has warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land, and widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred.\nEarth-orbiting satellites and new technologies have helped scientists see the big picture, collecting many different types of information about our planet and its climate all over the world. These data, collected over many years, reveal the signs and patterns of a changing climate.\nScientists demonstrated the heat-trapping nature of carbon dioxide and other gases in the mid-19th century.2 Many of the science instruments NASA uses to study our climate focus on how these gases affect the movement of infrared radiation through the atmosphere. From the measured impacts of increases in these gases, there is no question that increased greenhouse gas levels warm Earth in response.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nIce cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that Earth\u2019s climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly 10 times faster than the average rate of warming after an ice age. Carbon dioxide from human activities is increasing about 250 times faster than it did from natural sources after the last Ice Age.3\nThe planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and other human activities.4 Most of the warming occurred in the past 40 years, with the seven most recent years being the warmest. The years 2016 and 2020 are tied for the warmest year on record.5 Image credit: Ashwin Kumar, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic.\nThe ocean has absorbed much of this increased heat, with the top 100 meters (about 328 feet) of ocean showing warming of 0.67 degrees Fahrenheit (0.33 degrees Celsius) since 1969.6 Earth stores 90% of the extra energy in the ocean. Image credit: Kelsey Roberts/USGS\nThe Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass. Data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment show Greenland lost an average of 279 billion tons of ice per year between 1993 and 2019, while Antarctica lost about 148 billion tons of ice per year.7 Image: The Antarctic Peninsula, Credit: NASA\nGlaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world \u2014 including in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska, and Africa.8 Image: Miles Glacier, Alaska Image credit: NASA\nSatellite observations reveal that the amount of spring snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere has decreased over the past five decades and the snow is melting earlier.9 Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\nGlobal sea level rose about 8 inches (20 centimeters) in the last century.

Most of these human-caused (anthropogenic) greenhouse gas emissions were carbon dioxide (CO2) from burning fossil fuels.\nConcentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere are naturally regulated by many processes that are part of the global carbon cycle. The flux, or movement, of carbon between the atmosphere and the earth's land and oceans is dominated by natural processes such as plant photosynthesis. Although these natural processes can absorb some of the anthropogenic CO2 emissions produced each year, starting in about 1950, CO2 emissions began exceeding the capacity of these processes to absorb carbon.\nThis imbalance between greenhouse gas emissions and the ability for natural processes to absorb those emissions has resulted in a continued increase in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. Concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere in 2022 were about 1.5 times greater than the concentrations in 1850.\nClick to enlarge\nScientists know with virtual certainty that high levels of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere tend to warm the planet. In computer-based models, rising concentrations of greenhouse gases result in a rising average surface temperature of the earth over time. Rising temperatures may produce changes in precipitation patterns, storm severity, and sea level. Collectively, this phenomena is commonly referred to as climate change.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggests that the earth's climate warmed by an estimated 0.92 degrees Centigrade (1.66 degrees Fahrenheit) between 1880 and 2012 1 and that human activity is likely an important driving factor. The IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report (Chapter 3: Human Influence on the Climate System) states, \"It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land since pre-industrial times.\"\ndid you know\nIn 2022, fossil fuels were the source of about 83% of U.S. primary energy consumption, 93% of total U.S. CO2, and 74% of total gross U.S. greenhouse gas emissions resulting from human activity.2\nThe report further states, \"The likely range of human-induced warming in global-mean surface air temperature in 2010\u20132019 relative to 1850\u20131900 is 0.8\u00b0C\u20131.3\u00b0C.\" The IPCC concluded that the increasing concentration of the major greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide) \u201care unprecedented over at least the last 800,000 years.\u201d The IPCC ties this rise directly to human activity.\nLast updated: June 18, 2024.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Nitrogen and phosphorus are commonly used in agriculture, lawns, and other human activities.\n\nFull Page Content:\nFor centuries, keeping farmland in production has been critical to the economy and our nation\u2019s food security system. But increasingly, the State of California is recognizing the importance of preserving this land to help fight climate change, as noted in the 2030 Natural and Working Lands Climate Change Implementation Plan. Farmland offers open spaces and habitat for wildlife. It provides a buffer against development, which would mean more streets, traffic and greenhouse gas emissions.\nA big key to farm efficiency and a healthy environment isthe increasingly sophisticated use of fertilizers. Plants, like people, require nutrients to be healthy. By keeping plants healthy, fertilizers are responsible for strong roots, which prevents soil erosion and in turn protects green spaces and promotes biodiverse habitats.\nHealthy plants not only produce oxygen essential for all living things, but they contribute to the fight against climate change by absorbing massive amounts of carbon (CO2) from the atmosphere. A just released report by the California Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office estimates that modern fertilizers only contribute about one percent of the total greenhouse gases being emitted from all contributing urban and rural sources. However, a recent study by Stanford University estimates that healthy plants and soils absorb about 30 percent of total CO2 emitted. It is hard to imagine a more environmentally beneficial tradeoff for Californians than using fertilizers to promote healthy plants, who can then through photosynthesis convert massive amounts of CO2 into oxygen.\nWhile fertilizers are vital, there has been concerns raised about the potential contributions of nitrates leaching into groundwater aquifers. In response, California\u2019s fertilizer industry has been funding the Fertilizer Research & Education Program (FREP). Overseen by the California Department of Agriculture, for over 30 years FREP has led the country in fertilizer research and grower education to promote the agronomically sound and environmentally safe use of nitrogen products.\nIn keeping with their desire to be better environmental stewards of their land, thousands of farmers are utilizing this fertilizer industry funded program to learn how to improve the way they use water and fertilizers. The fertilizer industry is currently funding over $2,000,000 a year in grower education programs to help farmers maximize advanced management practices which will minimize potential nutrient impacts to water quality. FREP is a terrific example of a public-private partnership that is promoting best practices that allow farmers to keep their land in production while protecting the environment. Whether we are looking at water or air quality, the use of advanced fertilizers are helping to assure that agricultural contributions that impact our environment are minimized, while still maximizing the removal of greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. If California wants to continue to lead on pumping up the green in our state, fertilizers will need to play a role.\nBy Renee Pinel\nShare\nFollow Us\n\u00a9 2020 Western Plant Health.

Human activities like the ones mentioned above are causing greenhouse gases that are warming the world faster than at any time in at least the last two thousand years.\nThe average temperature of the Earth\u2019s surface is now about 1.42\u00b0C warmer than it was in the late 1800s-prior to the industrial revolution-and warmer than at any time in the last 100,000 years. The last decade (2015-2024) was the warmest on record, and each of the last four decades has been warmer than any previous decade since 1850.\nMany people think that climate change mainly means warmer temperatures. But temperature rise is only the beginning of the story. Because the Earth is a system where everything is connected, changes in one area can influence changes in all others.\nThe consequences of climate change include, among others, intense droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice, catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.\nClimate change can affect our health, ability to grow food, housing, safety and work. Some of us are already more vulnerable to climate impacts, such as people living in small island nations and other developing countries. Conditions like sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion have advanced to the point where entire communities have had to relocate, while protracted droughts are putting people at risk of famine. In the future, the number of people displaced by weather-related events is expected to rise.\nIn a series of UN reports, thousands of scientists and government reviewers agreed that limiting global temperature rise to no more than 1.5\u00b0C would help us avoid the worst climate impacts and maintain a liveable climate. Yet policies currently in place point to up to 2.8\u00b0C of warming by the end of the century.\nThe emissions that cause climate change come from every part of the world and affect everyone, but some countries produce much more than others. The six biggest emitters (China, the United States of America, India, the European Union, the Russian Federation, and Indonesia) together account for more than half of all global greenhouse gas emissions. By contrast, the 45 least developed countries contribute only 3 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.\nEveryone must take climate action, but people and countries creating more of the problem have a greater responsibility to act first.\nMany climate change solutions can deliver economic benefits while improving our lives and protecting the environment. We also have global frameworks and agreements to guide progress, such as the Sustainable Development Goals, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. Three broad categories of action are: cutting emissions, adapting to climate impacts and financing required adjustments.\nSwitching energy systems from fossil fuels to renewables like solar or wind will reduce the emissions driving climate change. But we have to act now. While a growing number of countries is committing to net zero emissions by 2050, emissions must be cut in half by 2030 to keep warming below 1.5\u00b0C. Achieving this means huge declines in the use of coal, oil and gas: production and consumption of all fossil fuels need to be cut by at least 30 per cent by 2030 in order to prevent catastrophic levels of climate change.\nAdapting to climate consequences protects people, homes, businesses, livelihoods, infrastructure and natural ecosystems. It covers current impacts and those likely in the future. Adaptation will be required everywhere but must be prioritized now for the most vulnerable people with the fewest resources to cope with climate hazards. The rate of return can be high. Early warning systems for disasters, for instance, save lives and property, and can deliver benefits up to 10 times the initial cost.\nClimate action requires significant financial investments by governments and businesses. But climate inaction is vastly more expensive. One critical step is for developed countries to support developing countries so they can adapt and move towards greener economies.\nTo get familiar with some of the more technical terms used in connection with climate change, consult the Climate Dictionary.\nClimate change is a hot topic \u2013 with myths and falsehoods circulating widely.

According to ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nThis website is an ARCHIVED version of NOAA Climate.gov as of June 25, 2025. Content is not being updated or maintained, and some links may no longer work.\nThe modern record of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels began with observations recorded at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. This graph shows the station's monthly average carbon dioxide measurements since 1958 in parts per million (ppm). The seasonal cycle of highs and lows (small peaks and valleys) is driven by Northern Hemisphere summer vegetation growth, which reduces atmospheric carbon dioxide, and winter decay, which increases it. The long-term trend of rising carbon dioxide levels is driven by human activities. At Mauna Loa, the highest monthly value each year occurs in May. In May 2024, carbon dioxide hit just under 427 ppm\u2014a new record. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on Mauna Loa monthly mean data from NOAA Global Monitoring Lab.\nBased on the annual analysis from NOAA\u2019s Global Monitoring Lab, global average atmospheric carbon dioxide was 422.8 parts per million (\u201cppm,\u201d for short) in 2024, a new record high. The increase during 2024 was 3.75 ppm\u2014the largest one-year increase on record. At Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii (graph above), where the modern carbon dioxide record began in 1958, the annual average carbon dioxide in 2024 was 424.61 ppm, also a new record.\nThe years with the largest annual carbon dioxide growth tend to be associated with the strongest El Ni\u00f1os\u2014the warm phase of a natural climate pattern in the tropical Pacific\u2014which lead to high temperatures over land and sea and an expansion of global drought area. In turn, these weather conditions typically lead to less plant growth, which reduces carbon dioxide uptake, as well as increased decomposition of carbon in soil and increased carbon dioxide emissions from forest fires. Together, these impacts cause atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to rise faster than normal.\nEven though the 2023-24 El Ni\u00f1o had waned by April, record high air temperatures and drought in all of 2024, similar to those during an El Nino, were likely drivers of the large increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide in 2024. In addition to other factors, large forest fires in both the Amazon and Canada contributed to the 2024 global increase.\nCarbon dioxide concentrations are rising mostly because of the fossil fuels that people have been burning for energy since the start of the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuels like coal and oil contain the carbon from millions of years of photosynthesis\u2014the process by which plants remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. We are returning that carbon to the atmosphere in just a few hundred years. Since the middle of the 20th century, annual emissions of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels have increased every decade, from close to 11 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year in the 1960s to an estimated 37.4 billion tons in 2024 according to the Global Carbon Budget 2024.\nThe amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (blue line) has increased along with human emissions (gray line) since the start of the Industrial Revolution in 1750. Emissions rose slowly to about 5 gigatons (1 gigaton is 1 billion metric tons per year) in the mid-20th century before rapidly increasing to more than 35 billion tons per year by the end of the century. NOAA Climate.gov graph, adapted from original by Dr. Howard Diamond (NOAA ARL). Atmospheric carbon dioxide data from NOAA and ETHZ. Carbon dioxide emissions data from Our World in Data and the Global Carbon Project.\nCarbon cycle experts estimate that natural \u201csinks,\u201d including plant growth and ocean absorption, remove about half of carbon dioxide humans emit into the atmosphere from fossil fuel burning. The rest stays in the atmosphere. Every year, we are adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than natural sinks can remove, and so the total amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere goes up. The bigger the overshoot, the faster atmospheric carbon dioxide increases.\nIn the 1960s, atmospheric carbon dioxide increased by about 0.8 ppm per year on average. That growth rate doubled to an average of 1.6 ppm per year in the 1980s and 1.5 ppm per year in the 1990s. In the last decade (2015-2024), the annual increase has accelerated to 2.6 ppm per year. As a result, the annual rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide over the past 60 years is 100-200 times faster than the increase that occurred at the end of the last ice age 11,000-17,000 years ago.\nCarbon dioxide is Earth\u2019s most important long-lived greenhouse gas: a gas that absorbs and radiates heat. Unlike oxygen or nitrogen (which make up most of Earth's atmosphere), greenhouse gases absorb heat radiating from the Earth\u2019s surface and re-release it in all directions\u2014including back toward Earth\u2019s surface. Without any carbon dioxide, Earth\u2019s natural greenhouse effect would be too weak to keep the average global surface temperature above freezing.\nBy adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, people are amplifying the natural greenhouse effect, causing global temperature to rise. According to observations and analysis by the NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory, carbon dioxide alone is responsible for about 80 percent of the total heating influence of all human-produced greenhouse gases since 1990.\nAnother reason carbon dioxide is important in the Earth system is that it dissolves into the ocean like the fizz in a can of soda. It reacts with water molecules, producing carbonic acid and lowering the ocean's pH (raising its acidity). Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, the pH of the ocean's surface waters has dropped from 8.21 to 8.10. This drop in pH is called ocean acidification, and it interferes with the ability of marine life to extract calcium from sea water to build skeletons and shells.\n(left) A healthy ocean snail has a transparent shell with smoothly contoured ridges.

The sampler is designed to remove excess water vapor from the sampled air and compress it without contamination into ~1-liter volumes. These flasks are analyzed at the NOAA\u2019s Global Monitoring Division laboratory for trace gasses and at the INSTAR\u2019s Staple Isotope Lab laboratory for isotopes of methane. More than 60 trace gases found in the global atmosphere can be measured at mole fractions that range from parts-per-million (10-6), e.g., carbon dioxide, down to parts-per-quadrillion (10-15), e.g., HFC-365mfc. The chemical species monitored include N2O, SF6, H2, CS2, OCS, CO2, CH4, CO, CFCs, HCFCs, HFCs, Solvents, Methyl Halides, Hydrocarbons and Perfluorocarbons.\nMedusa collects 32 cryogenically dried, flow and pressure controlled samples per flight. The samples are collected by an automated sampler into 1.5 L glass flasks that integrate over 25-s (1 e-fold) periods. Medusa provides discretely-sampled comparisons for onboard in situ O2/N2 ratio and CO2 measurements and unique measurements of Ar/N2 and 13C, 14C, and 18O isotopologues of CO2. The complementary measurements allow ground-truthing of onboard instrument measurements in a laboratory setting, where analysis conditions can often be more stringently controlled and carefully monitored. Isotope and argon measurements can provide additional information about land and ocean controls over the carbon cycle, and about the age and source of the air sampled.\nMedusa consists of an onboard computer, two pressure controllers, two pumps, three multi-position selector valves, and a host of other hardware that control and direct the air samples. All air is dried by passing it through traps immersed in a -78 C dry ice bath, adjusted to match atmospheric pressure at sea level, and then automatically isolated in a flask. Medusa flasks are analyzed on a sector-magnet mass spectrometer and a LiCor non-dispersive infrared CO2 analyzer by the Scripps O2 Program at Scripps Institution of Oceanography.\n32 samples/flight (ER-2); 50 samples/flight (WB57); 90 samples/flight (Global Hawk)\nUpdated control system with remote control capability\nFill times \u201314 km 30 \u2013 40 sec \u201316 km 40 \u2013 50 sec \u201318 km 50 \u2013 60 sec \u201320 km 100 \u2013 120 sec (estimated)\nAnalysis in UM lab: GC/MS; GC/FID; GC/ECD\nThe Whole Air Sampler (WAS) collects samples from airborne platforms for detailed analysis of a wide range of trace gases. The compounds that are typically measured from the WAS includes trace gases with sources from industrial midlatitude emissions, from biomass burning, and from the marine boundary layer, with certain compounds (e.g. organic nitrates) that have a unique source in the equatorial surface ocean. The use of a broad suite of tracers with different sources and lifetimes provides powerful diagnostic information on air mass history and chemical processing that currently is only available from measurements from whole air samples. Previous deployments of the whole air sampler have shown that the sampling and analytical procedures employed by our group are capable of accessing the wide range of mixing ratios at sufficient precision to be used for tracer studies. Thus, routine measurement of species, such as methyl iodide, at <= 0.1 x 10-12 mole fraction, or NMHC at levels of a few x 10-12 mole fraction are possible. In addition to the tracer aspects of the whole air sampler measurements, we measure a full suite of halocarbon species that provide information on the role of short-lived halocarbons in the tropical UT/LS region, on halogen budgets in the UT/LS region, and on continuing increasing temporal trends of HFCs (such as 134a), HCFCs (such as HCFC 141b), PFCs (such as C2F6), as well as declining levels of some of the major CFCs and halogenated solvents. The measurements of those species that are changing rapidly in the troposphere also give direct indications of the age and origin of air entering the stratosphere.\nThe UC-Irvine research group collected whole air samples aboard the NASA DC-8 aircraft during the summer 2019 NASA Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments Experiment - Air Quality (FIREX-AQ) field mission. More than 70 trace gases were identified and quantified at our Irvine laboratory, including C2-C10 NMHCs, C1-C2 halocarbons, C1-C5 alkyl nitrates, and selected sulfur compounds using our established technique of airborne whole air sampling followed by laboratory analysis using gas chromatography (GC) with flame ionization detection (FID), electron capture detection (ECD), and mass spectrometric detection (MSD). Our experimental procedures build on those that have been successfully employed for numerous prior NASA field missions, for example PEM Tropics A and B, TRACE-P, INTEX-A and B, ARCTAS, DC-3, SEAC4RS, ATom, KORUS-AQ, FIREX-AQ, and SARP.\nPage Last Updated: April 22, 2017\nPage Editor: Brad Bulger\nNASA Official: Mihailo Derek Rutovic\nWebsite Issues: Contact Us\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

If you\u2019ve ever driven past one, your nose will tell you that those piles of garbage are emitting gas. Landfill gas, which is a biogas\u2014 composed primarily of methane and carbon dioxide\u2014isn\u2019t just stinky, it also contributes to global climate change. Large landfills are required to collect and burn their biogas to reduce the amount of unhealthy fumes they emit. But biogas has more beneficial uses. It can be converted to compressed natural gas or hydrogen, or be used to generate electricity. As more and more cars, trucks, and buses start to operate on these alternative fuels, it seems a waste to send any of our biogas up in smoke. What if we converted all available U.S. garbage fumes from large landfills into transportation fuel?\nSome U.S. landfills are already collecting biogas for use in energy projects2. EPA estimates that there are about 450 landfills with untapped potential to use their garbage fumes. These landfills could collect an approximate total of 475 million cubic feet of biogas per day \u2014 enough to fill nearly a billion party balloons.\nIf we converted all this biogas to transportation fuel, we could prevent about 40 million metric tons of direct GHG emissions (CO2e) from being released each year, equivalent to taking 8 million cars off the road.3\nPlus, because we are displacing gasoline or diesel, we would also reduce lifecycle GHG emissions associated with producing and distributing the fuel used by those vehicles.\nIf your local landfill is large, it may be emitting enough gas to produce up to 3,200 gallons gasoline equivalent (GGE) of transportation fuel each day. (One GGE is the amount of fuel that contains the same energy as one gallon of gasoline.) How many vehicles would this power?\n*The higher number of electric cars (EVs) reflects both that cars consume less fuel per mile than garbage trucks or buses and that EVs today have a limited driving range per battery charge. We assumed a fully charged EV battery would power about 100 miles of driving.\nEven more opportunities will emerge as additional cars, trucks, and buses that use advanced fuels enter the market. So, next time you are driving by a landfill, don\u2019t just think, \u201cEwww!\u201d think, \u201csmells like a refueling opportunity!\u201d\nWhat If Garbage Fumes Powered More of Our Cars, Trucks, and Buses?

But increasingly, the State of California is recognizing the importance of preserving this land to help fight climate change, as noted in the 2030 Natural and Working Lands Climate Change Implementation Plan. Farmland offers open spaces and habitat for wildlife. It provides a buffer against development, which would mean more streets, traffic and greenhouse gas emissions.\nA big key to farm efficiency and a healthy environment isthe increasingly sophisticated use of fertilizers. Plants, like people, require nutrients to be healthy. By keeping plants healthy, fertilizers are responsible for strong roots, which prevents soil erosion and in turn protects green spaces and promotes biodiverse habitats.\nHealthy plants not only produce oxygen essential for all living things, but they contribute to the fight against climate change by absorbing massive amounts of carbon (CO2) from the atmosphere. A just released report by the California Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office estimates that modern fertilizers only contribute about one percent of the total greenhouse gases being emitted from all contributing urban and rural sources. However, a recent study by Stanford University estimates that healthy plants and soils absorb about 30 percent of total CO2 emitted. It is hard to imagine a more environmentally beneficial tradeoff for Californians than using fertilizers to promote healthy plants, who can then through photosynthesis convert massive amounts of CO2 into oxygen.\nWhile fertilizers are vital, there has been concerns raised about the potential contributions of nitrates leaching into groundwater aquifers. In response, California\u2019s fertilizer industry has been funding the Fertilizer Research & Education Program (FREP). Overseen by the California Department of Agriculture, for over 30 years FREP has led the country in fertilizer research and grower education to promote the agronomically sound and environmentally safe use of nitrogen products.\nIn keeping with their desire to be better environmental stewards of their land, thousands of farmers are utilizing this fertilizer industry funded program to learn how to improve the way they use water and fertilizers. The fertilizer industry is currently funding over $2,000,000 a year in grower education programs to help farmers maximize advanced management practices which will minimize potential nutrient impacts to water quality. FREP is a terrific example of a public-private partnership that is promoting best practices that allow farmers to keep their land in production while protecting the environment. Whether we are looking at water or air quality, the use of advanced fertilizers are helping to assure that agricultural contributions that impact our environment are minimized, while still maximizing the removal of greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. If California wants to continue to lead on pumping up the green in our state, fertilizers will need to play a role.\nBy Renee Pinel\nShare\nFollow Us\n\u00a9 2020 Western Plant Health.

Such shifts can be natural, due to changes in the sun\u2019s activity or large volcanic eruptions. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.\nBurning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun\u2019s heat and raising temperatures.\nThe main greenhouse gases that are causing climate change include carbon dioxide and methane. These come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example. Clearing land and cutting down forests can also release carbon dioxide. Agriculture, oil and gas operations are major sources of methane emissions. Energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main sectors causing greenhouse gases.\nClimate scientists have showed that humans are responsible for virtually all global heating over the last 200 years. Human activities like the ones mentioned above are causing greenhouse gases that are warming the world faster than at any time in at least the last two thousand years.\nThe average temperature of the Earth\u2019s surface is now about 1.42\u00b0C warmer than it was in the late 1800s-prior to the industrial revolution-and warmer than at any time in the last 100,000 years. The last decade (2015-2024) was the warmest on record, and each of the last four decades has been warmer than any previous decade since 1850.\nMany people think that climate change mainly means warmer temperatures. But temperature rise is only the beginning of the story. Because the Earth is a system where everything is connected, changes in one area can influence changes in all others.\nThe consequences of climate change include, among others, intense droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice, catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.\nClimate change can affect our health, ability to grow food, housing, safety and work. Some of us are already more vulnerable to climate impacts, such as people living in small island nations and other developing countries. Conditions like sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion have advanced to the point where entire communities have had to relocate, while protracted droughts are putting people at risk of famine. In the future, the number of people displaced by weather-related events is expected to rise.\nIn a series of UN reports, thousands of scientists and government reviewers agreed that limiting global temperature rise to no more than 1.5\u00b0C would help us avoid the worst climate impacts and maintain a liveable climate. Yet policies currently in place point to up to 2.8\u00b0C of warming by the end of the century.\nThe emissions that cause climate change come from every part of the world and affect everyone, but some countries produce much more than others. The six biggest emitters (China, the United States of America, India, the European Union, the Russian Federation, and Indonesia) together account for more than half of all global greenhouse gas emissions. By contrast, the 45 least developed countries contribute only 3 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.\nEveryone must take climate action, but people and countries creating more of the problem have a greater responsibility to act first.\nMany climate change solutions can deliver economic benefits while improving our lives and protecting the environment. We also have global frameworks and agreements to guide progress, such as the Sustainable Development Goals, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. Three broad categories of action are: cutting emissions, adapting to climate impacts and financing required adjustments.\nSwitching energy systems from fossil fuels to renewables like solar or wind will reduce the emissions driving climate change. But we have to act now. While a growing number of countries is committing to net zero emissions by 2050, emissions must be cut in half by 2030 to keep warming below 1.5\u00b0C. Achieving this means huge declines in the use of coal, oil and gas: production and consumption of all fossil fuels need to be cut by at least 30 per cent by 2030 in order to prevent catastrophic levels of climate change.\nAdapting to climate consequences protects people, homes, businesses, livelihoods, infrastructure and natural ecosystems. It covers current impacts and those likely in the future. Adaptation will be required everywhere but must be prioritized now for the most vulnerable people with the fewest resources to cope with climate hazards. The rate of return can be high. Early warning systems for disasters, for instance, save lives and property, and can deliver benefits up to 10 times the initial cost.\nClimate action requires significant financial investments by governments and businesses. But climate inaction is vastly more expensive. One critical step is for developed countries to support developing countries so they can adapt and move towards greener economies.\nTo get familiar with some of the more technical terms used in connection with climate change, consult the Climate Dictionary.\nClimate change is a hot topic \u2013 with myths and falsehoods circulating widely.

These instruments play a crucial role in ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nTo accurately measure greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the field, scientists primarily rely on four categories of tools: nondispersive infrared (NDIR) spectroscopy, cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS), flux-based instruments like eddy covariance towers and flux chambers, and remote sensing platforms including satellites and drones.\nEach method leverages the unique way GHG molecules absorb specific wavelengths of infrared light\u2014creating identifiable \u201cspectral fingerprints\u201d\u2014to detect and quantify these gases in the atmosphere, often in parts per million or billion. This is how we know that CO\u2082 concentrations reached 426.89 ppm in May 2024, and methane levels hover around 1.92 ppm, according to NOAA and Scripps.\nTable of Contents\nGreenhouse gases are invisible, odorless, and present in minute concentrations\u2014but their impacts on the climate are immense. Since the 1994 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the global goal has been to stabilize GHG concentrations and avoid dangerous climate disruption.\nDespite international agreements like the Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement, concentrations of CO\u2082, CH\u2084, and N\u2082O continue to rise, except for chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which are declining due to the 1987 Montreal Protocol.\nHere are 2023 global averages:\nTo track progress, identify sources, and enforce policies, scientists need accurate, real-time, and large-scale GHG measurement tools.\nNDIR spectroscopy is one of the oldest and most widely used techniques for measuring GHGs, particularly CO\u2082. It works by passing infrared light through an air sample and measuring how much of the light is absorbed at specific wavelengths. A filter ensures that only wavelengths absorbed by the target gas\u2014such as 4.26 microns for CO\u2082\u2014reach the detector. The more gas present, the more light is absorbed, which allows the instrument to quantify the concentration.\nNDIR was the method used by Charles David Keeling in 1958 to begin monitoring atmospheric CO\u2082 levels at Mauna Loa Observatory. His data series, known as the Keeling Curve, showed for the first time that CO\u2082 levels were steadily rising, as noted by ACS.\nIn 1958, CO\u2082 concentration was 313 parts per million (ppm). As of May 2024, the concentration had increased to 426.89 ppm\u2014a 36% rise. NDIR remains a standard tool in many monitoring stations around the world due to its robustness and reliability, although newer methods offer higher sensitivity.\nCRDS is a more modern technique that allows for extremely sensitive detection of GHGs, even at very low concentrations. It involves a laser tuned to a gas-specific wavelength and a highly reflective chamber.\nWhen the laser is turned off, the light continues to bounce between the mirrors thousands of times, gradually diminishing in intensity. The rate of this \u201cring-down\u201d is affected by the presence of GHGs in the chamber, which absorb some of the light. Faster decay means higher concentrations.\nCRDS instruments require only small amounts of calibration gas, making them ideal for long-term field use. They are now widely deployed by organizations like NOAA and Scripps Institution of Oceanography.\nAccording to Science Daily, CRDS sensors have been used to monitor urban emissions in Los Angeles and Washington D.C., where they detected measurable reductions in CO\u2082 during the COVID-19 pandemic. CRDS can also distinguish between carbon isotopes, helping identify how much CO\u2082 in the air comes from fossil fuels versus natural sources.\nEddy covariance is a micrometeorological method used to measure the exchange of gases between the land surface and the atmosphere. Towers equipped with 3D sonic anemometers and fast-response gas analyzers measure vertical wind speed and GHG concentrations at high frequencies (e.g., 10\u201320 times per second) as noted by Copernicus.\nThis allows scientists to calculate the net flux of gases like CO\u2082 and CH\u2084 over time.\nThese towers are widely deployed in ecosystems such as forests, wetlands, and grasslands to understand how these environments act as carbon sources or sinks. Data from eddy covariance networks are crucial for validating climate models and informing land-use policy.\nUnlike point measurements, this method provides continuous, real-time data over large areas, though it requires significant infrastructure and data processing.\nFlux chambers are portable devices placed over soil, vegetation, or water surfaces to measure GHG emissions from specific sources. They enclose a known volume of air and track how gas concentrations change over time.\nBy measuring the rate at which gases like CH\u2084 and N\u2082O accumulate inside the chamber, researchers can estimate the emission rate from the underlying surface.\nFlux chambers are commonly used in agriculture to study emissions from fertilized fields, manure storage, and rice paddies.\nThey are also used in wetlands, landfills, and other environments where emissions are localized. While easy to deploy and relatively inexpensive, they measure only small areas and can disrupt natural conditions if not used carefully.\nSatellites provide global coverage of GHG concentrations by measuring sunlight that has been reflected off Earth\u2019s surface and passed through the atmosphere.\nInstruments aboard satellites like NASA\u2019s Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) and ESA\u2019s Sentinel-5P (with TROPOMI) use spectroscopy to analyze which wavelengths are absorbed by gases in the atmospheric column, according to eoportal. This allows for the detection of CO\u2082, CH\u2084, and other gases over broad areas.\nSatellites are especially useful for identifying large emission sources, known as \u201csuper-emitters,\u201d such as oil and gas fields or large landfills. They also provide long-term trend data that helps verify national emissions inventories.\nHowever, they cannot directly measure emissions at the ground level and rely on complex models and reference data for calibration. Despite these limitations, satellite data have shown that landfills and fossil fuel infrastructure in the U.S. may be emitting sign\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

It lets us observe environmental conditions globally. The ability to capture data across vast regions helps fight air pollution, a growing concern worldwide. Satellites help identify pollution sources, track changes, and evaluate how well air quality regulations work.\nSatellite-based air quality monitoring provides real-time, large-scale data. This data helps us understand pollution patterns and their effects on human health and the environment. Satellites enable continuous observation, offering consistent information that supports better decisions.\nBenefits of satellite-based air quality monitoring include:\nSatellite-based air quality monitoring helps manage and reduce air pollution globally. Its environmental data supports effective air quality management strategies.\nAir quality monitoring has transformed significantly over the years. Traditional methods relied heavily on ground-based sensors, which provided localized data. These sensors have many advantages, but they offer limited geographical coverage, restricting their ability to assess air pollution on a larger scale.\nModern advancements have revolutionized monitoring capabilities. Integrating satellite data has expanded our reach, enabling global observation with enhanced precision. Satellite-based systems provide real-time, comprehensive data, capturing air quality metrics across regions previously inaccessible by ground-based sensors.]\nAir quality measurement methods include:\nSatellite technology complements traditional methods, providing a more holistic understanding of air quality. These innovations empower stakeholders to make informed decisions, addressing air pollution with greater efficacy. How satellite technology measures air quality\nSatellites revolutionize air quality monitoring with advanced technologies that measure pollutants over vast areas. They operate using spectral analysis and sophisticated pollutant detection algorithms. These methodologies enable satellites to capture detailed information about atmospheric components.\nSpectral analysis is central to satellite monitoring. It involves measuring the light reflected or emitted from the Earth\u2019s surface and atmosphere at various wavelengths. This data helps identify specific gases and particles present in the air. By analyzing these spectral signatures, satellites can detect and quantify pollutants with precision.\nPollutant detection algorithms process the spectral data to identify concentrations of various pollutants. These algorithms are designed to differentiate between natural and anthropogenic sources of pollution. They also track changes in pollutant levels over time, providing valuable insights into air quality dynamics.\nSatellite technology provides a comprehensive view of air quality and supports effective policies and interventions to improve environmental health.\nSatellite data delivers unparalleled insights into air quality on both global and regional scales. Our ability to observe pollution patterns over large areas allows for a comprehensive understanding of how pollutants spread and interact with the environment. This broad perspective is crucial in identifying pollution hotspots and facilitating targeted interventions.\nGlobally, satellite data reveals trends in air pollution, helping to track the movement and concentration of pollutants like nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter. This data provides clarity on the transboundary nature of air pollution, illustrating how emissions in one area can affect regions far beyond their origin. Such insights are essential for international cooperation and policy-making aimed at reducing global pollution levels, as outlined in our discussion on collaborative efforts in air quality monitoring with advanced sensor technology.\nRegionally, satellite data has driven significant policy changes. Some examples of where satellite-based monitoring has been instrumental include:\nSatellite technology empowers us with a detailed understanding of air pollution dynamics, supporting effective policy development and fostering healthier communities worldwide. Improved air pollution data is aiding policy development, as described in our analysis of actionable air pollution data for healthier communities.\nSatellite air quality monitoring faces several technological and methodological challenges. One significant issue is data resolution. Satellites often provide broad coverage but struggle with capturing detailed, localized data. This limitation hinders the ability to monitor air pollution at street-level precision, which is crucial for urban areas.\nAtmospheric interference presents another challenge. Clouds, weather conditions, and atmospheric particles can disrupt satellite readings, affecting data accuracy and complicating the differentiation between pollution sources and natural atmospheric elements.\nIntegrating satellite data with other monitoring systems is complex. Ground-based sensors and mobile monitoring offer detailed local data but need alignment with satellite observations to provide a comprehensive view. This integration requires advanced data processing capabilities to ensure consistency and reliability across different platforms.\nApproaches to mitigate the challenges associated with satellite-based monitoring include:\nLeveraging detailed sensor deployment insights can furt\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",
