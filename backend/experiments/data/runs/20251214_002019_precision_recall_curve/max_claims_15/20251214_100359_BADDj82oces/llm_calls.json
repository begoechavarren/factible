The sequence of the Fv1 gene most closely resembles that of an endogenous retrovirus gag gene (Best et al. 1996), Fv1 blocks infection by a poorly understood mechanism that operates after reverse transcription but before integration and likely requires direct recognition of infecting viral capsids, as N/B-tropism is determined by sequence differences in the capsid (CA) portion of the viral Gag protein.\nBeginning in the 1990s, sporadic evidence emerged that hinted at the existence of additional restriction factors, including factors affecting HIV-1. For instance, (1) virus infectivity or the capacity of viral accessory genes to function could be profoundly affected by the animal species of the cells under experimental examination (Simon et al. 1998b; Hofmann et al. 1999); and (2) the requirements for individual accessory genes during virus replication could vary enormously between human cell lines (Gabuzda et al. 1992; Varthakavi et al. 2003).

HIV uses a complex series of steps to deliver its genome into the host cell cytoplasm while simultaneously evading the host immune response. To infect cells, the HIV protein envelope (Env) binds to the primary cellular receptor CD4 and then to a cellular coreceptor. This sequential binding triggers fusion of the viral and host cell membranes, initiating infection. Revealing the mechanism of HIV entry has profound implications for viral tropism, transmission, pathogenesis, and therapeutic intervention. Here, we provide an overview into the mechanism of HIV entry, provide historical context to key discoveries, discuss recent advances, and speculate on future directions in the field.\nThe HIV envelope protein binds to the host cell receptor CD4 and then to a cellular coreceptor. This triggers fusion of the viral and host cell membranes, initiating infection.\nHIV entry, the first phase of the viral replication cycle, begins with the adhesion of virus to the host cell and ends with the fusion of the cell and viral membranes with subsequent delivery of the viral core into the cytoplasm. The intricate series of protein\u2013protein interactions that ultimately results in virus infection can be divided into several phases, some of which are essential and others that may serve to modulate the efficiency of the process. First, virions must bind to the target cell, with this being mediated either by the viral envelope (Env) protein or host cell membrane proteins incorporated into the virion with any one of a number of various cell attachment factors. Attachment can be relatively nonspecific, with Env interacting with negatively charged cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (Saphire et al. 2001), or can result from more specific interactions between Env and \u03b14\u03b27 integrin (Arthos et al. 2008; Cicala et al. 2009) or pattern recognition receptors such as dendritic cell\u2013specific intercellular adhesion molecular 3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) (Geijtenbeek et al. 2000; reviewed in Ugolini et al. 1999). HIV attachment to the host cell via any of these factors likely brings Env into close proximity with the viral receptor CD4 and coreceptor, increasing the efficiency of infection (Fig. 1) (Orloff et al. 1991). However, attachment factors differ from receptors in that they are not essential, and although they augment infection in vitro, their physiologic role in vivo remains unclear.\nOverview of HIV entry. To deliver the viral payload into cells, HIV Env, comprised of gp120 and gp41 subunits (1), first attaches to the host cell, binding CD4 (2). This causes conformational changes in Env, allowing coreceptor binding, which is mediated in part by the V3 loop of Env (3). This initiates the membrane fusion process as the fusion peptide of gp41 inserts into the target membrane, followed by six-helix bundle formation and complete membrane fusion (4).\nThe second step of virus entry and the first absolutely required for infection entails binding of Env to its primary receptor, the host protein CD4 (Maddon et al. 1986; McDougal et al. 1986). Env is a heavily glycosylated trimer of gp120 and gp41 heterodimers. The gp120 subunit is responsible for receptor binding and gp120 contains five relatively conserved domains (C1\u2013C5) and five variable loops (V1\u2013V5), named for their relative genetic heterogeneity. Each of the variable regions is comprised of a loop structure formed by a disulfide bond at its base, with the exception of V5. The variable loops lie predominantly at the surface of gp120 and play critical roles in immune evasion and coreceptor binding, particularly the V3 loop (reviewed in Hartley et al. 2005). CD4 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily that normally functions to enhance T-cell receptor (TCR)-mediated signaling. Env interacts with the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) in gp120 (Kwong et al. 1998). Env binding to CD4 causes rearrangements of V1/V2 and subsequently V3. In addition, CD4 binding leads to formation of the bridging sheet, a four-stranded \u03b2 sheet comprised of two double-stranded \u03b2 sheets that are spatially separated in the unliganded state (Kwong et al. 1998; Chen et al. 2005). The bridging sheet and repositioned V3 loop play critical roles in the next step of virus entry, coreceptor engagement.\nThe third step of virus entry, coreceptor binding, is widely thought to be the trigger that activates the membrane fusion potential of Env. HIV strains can be broadly classified based on their coreceptor usage. Viruses that use the chemokine receptor CCR5 are termed R5 HIV, those that use CXCR4 are termed X4 HIV, and viruses that can use both coreceptors are called R5X4 HIV (Berger et al. 1998). There is no compelling evidence that coreceptors other than CCR5 and CXCR4 play important roles in supporting infection of HIV-1 in vivo. With rare exception, only R5 and R5X4 viruses are transmitted between individuals (Keele et al. 2008), likely owing to multiple imperfect but overlapping host restrictions on X4 HIV transmission (reviewed in Margolis and Shattock 2006). Interestingly, despite identification at earlier time points and despite high levels of CXCR4 expression on circulating HIV target cells, X4 or even R5X4 HIV rarely predominate until late in infection (Tersmette et al. 1989; Schuitemaker et al. 1992; Connor et al. 1997). In addition, X4 viruses are less common in clade C HIV and SIV infection (Chen et al. 1998; Ping et al. 1999; Cecilia et al. 2000; Huang et al. 2007). Several nonmutually exclusive models may explain this. First, clade B Envs may be different in their ability to adapt to CXCR4 tropism. Second, there may be differences in clade B host biology. For instance, clade B hosts may have mitigated neutralizing antibod\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

However, HIV-1 generally evades these potent inhibitory activities in human cells.\nHIV-1, in common with all viruses, requires the concerted contributions of numerous positively acting cellular factors and pathways to achieve efficient replication (Bushman et al. 2009). Conversely, mammalian cells also express a number of diverse, dominantly acting proteins that are widely expressed and function in a cell-autonomous manner to suppress virus replication. These have been termed restriction factors and/or intrinsic resistance factors, and they provide an initial (or early) line of defense against infection as a component of, or even preceding, innate antiviral responses. This work discusses the most extensively described examples of such factors, focusing on their impact on HIV-1. These are the apolipoprotein B messenger RNA (mRNA)-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (APOBEC3) family of proteins (in particular, APOBEC3G), tetherin/bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2 (BST2)/CD317 (hereafter called tetherin), and tripartite-motif-containing 5\u03b1 (TRIM5\u03b1).\nA fundamental concept to the biology of restriction factors is that HIV-1 generally evades their potent inhibitory activities in human cells, thereby allowing virus replication to proceed efficiently. In contrast, the ability of HIV-1 to replicate in nonhuman cells is often severely compromised by restriction factors, thus marking these proteins as important determinants of viral host range and cross-species transmission. The mechanisms for evasion from restriction factors are virus encoded and frequently involve HIV-1\u2019s regulatory/accessory proteins, namely, Vif, Nef, Vpu, and Vpr. Indeed, the need to escape intrinsic resistance appears to have been an important driving force behind the acquisition of these viral genes. Aside from restriction factor evasion, the Vpu and Nef proteins regulate the expression and localization of a number of host proteins important during HIV-1 replication. Prominent among these interactions, Vpu and Nef both inhibit the cell-surface expression of the primary entry receptor CD4, as well as major histocompatibility class I complexes (MHC class I), whereas Nef also helps promote T-cell activation and HIV-1 particle infectivity (reviewed by Kirchhoff 2010).\nThe intellectual framework for considering restriction factors was established through studies of ecotropic murine leukemia virus (MLV). Specifically, mice encode a gene, Fv1, with two principal allelic forms, Fv1n and Fv1b. Fv1n cells are up to 1000-fold more susceptible to infection by N-tropic strains of MLV than B-tropic strains, and Fv1n mice are correspondingly highly receptive to N-MLV induced disease. The opposite is true for Fv1b cells and animals, which are susceptible to B- rather than N-MLV.

HIV uses a complex series of steps to deliver its genome into the host cell cytoplasm while simultaneously evading the host immune response. To infect cells, the HIV protein envelope (Env) binds to the primary cellular receptor CD4 and then to a cellular coreceptor. This sequential binding triggers fusion of the viral and host cell membranes, initiating infection. Revealing the mechanism of HIV entry has profound implications for viral tropism, transmission, pathogenesis, and therapeutic intervention. Here, we provide an overview into the mechanism of HIV entry, provide historical context to key discoveries, discuss recent advances, and speculate on future directions in the field.\nThe HIV envelope protein binds to the host cell receptor CD4 and then to a cellular coreceptor. This triggers fusion of the viral and host cell membranes, initiating infection.\nHIV entry, the first phase of the viral replication cycle, begins with the adhesion of virus to the host cell and ends with the fusion of the cell and viral membranes with subsequent delivery of the viral core into the cytoplasm. The intricate series of protein\u2013protein interactions that ultimately results in virus infection can be divided into several phases, some of which are essential and others that may serve to modulate the efficiency of the process. First, virions must bind to the target cell, with this being mediated either by the viral envelope (Env) protein or host cell membrane proteins incorporated into the virion with any one of a number of various cell attachment factors. Attachment can be relatively nonspecific, with Env interacting with negatively charged cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (Saphire et al. 2001), or can result from more specific interactions between Env and \u03b14\u03b27 integrin (Arthos et al. 2008; Cicala et al. 2009) or pattern recognition receptors such as dendritic cell\u2013specific intercellular adhesion molecular 3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) (Geijtenbeek et al. 2000; reviewed in Ugolini et al. 1999). HIV attachment to the host cell via any of these factors likely brings Env into close proximity with the viral receptor CD4 and coreceptor, increasing the efficiency of infection (Fig. 1) (Orloff et al. 1991). However, attachment factors differ from receptors in that they are not essential, and although they augment infection in vitro, their physiologic role in vivo remains unclear.\nOverview of HIV entry. To deliver the viral payload into cells, HIV Env, comprised of gp120 and gp41 subunits (1), first attaches to the host cell, binding CD4 (2). This causes conformational changes in Env, allowing coreceptor binding, which is mediated in part by the V3 loop of Env (3). This initiates the membrane fusion process as the fusion peptide of gp41 inserts into the target membrane, followed by six-helix bundle formation and complete membrane fusion (4).\nThe second step of virus entry and the first absolutely required for infection entails binding of Env to its primary receptor, the host protein CD4 (Maddon et al. 1986; McDougal et al. 1986). Env is a heavily glycosylated trimer of gp120 and gp41 heterodimers. The gp120 subunit is responsible for receptor binding and gp120 contains five relatively conserved domains (C1\u2013C5) and five variable loops (V1\u2013V5), named for their relative genetic heterogeneity. Each of the variable regions is comprised of a loop structure formed by a disulfide bond at its base, with the exception of V5. The variable loops lie predominantly at the surface of gp120 and play critical roles in immune evasion and coreceptor binding, particularly the V3 loop (reviewed in Hartley et al. 2005). CD4 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily that normally functions to enhance T-cell receptor (TCR)-mediated signaling. Env interacts with the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) in gp120 (Kwong et al. 1998). Env binding to CD4 causes rearrangements of V1/V2 and subsequently V3. In addition, CD4 binding leads to formation of the bridging sheet, a four-stranded \u03b2 sheet comprised of two double-stranded \u03b2 sheets that are spatially separated in the unliganded state (Kwong et al. 1998; Chen et al. 2005). The bridging sheet and repositioned V3 loop play critical roles in the next step of virus entry, coreceptor engagement.\nThe third step of virus entry, coreceptor binding, is widely thought to be the trigger that activates the membrane fusion potential of Env. HIV strains can be broadly classified based on their coreceptor usage. Viruses that use the chemokine receptor CCR5 are termed R5 HIV, those that use CXCR4 are termed X4 HIV, and viruses that can use both coreceptors are called R5X4 HIV (Berger et al. 1998). There is no compelling evidence that coreceptors other than CCR5 and CXCR4 play important roles in supporting infection of HIV-1 in vivo. With rare exception, only R5 and R5X4 viruses are transmitted between individuals (Keele et al. 2008), likely owing to multiple imperfect but overlapping host restrictions on X4 HIV transmission (reviewed in Margolis and Shattock 2006). Interestingly, despite identification at earlier time points and despite high levels of CXCR4 expression on circulating HIV target cells, X4 or even R5X4 HIV rarely predominate until late in infection (Tersmette et al. 1989; Schuitemaker et al. 1992; Connor et al. 1997). In addition, X4 viruses are less common in clade C HIV and SIV infection (Chen et al. 1998; Ping et al. 1999; Cecilia et al. 2000; Huang et al. 2007). Several nonmutually exclusive models may explain this. First, clade B Envs may be different in their ability to adapt to CXCR4 tropism. Second, there may be differences in clade B host biology. For instance, clade B hosts may have mitigated neutralizing antibod\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

These advances have not only informed fundamental concepts of viral replication and pathogenesis but have also provided novel insights into host cell biology. This is illustrated by the recent descriptions of host-encoded restriction factors that can serve as effective inhibitors of retroviral replication. Here, we review our understanding of the three restriction factors that have been widely shown to be potent inhibitors of HIV-1: namely, APOBEC3G, TRIM5\u03b1, and tetherin. In each case, we discuss how these unrelated proteins were identified, the mechanisms by which they inhibit replication, the means used by HIV-1 to evade their action, and their potential contributions to viral pathogenesis as well as inter- and intraspecies transmission.\nHost-encoded restriction factors (e.g., APOBEC3G, TRIM5\u03b2 , and tetherin) inhibit HIV-1 replication in nonhuman cells. However, HIV-1 generally evades these potent inhibitory activities in human cells.\nHIV-1, in common with all viruses, requires the concerted contributions of numerous positively acting cellular factors and pathways to achieve efficient replication (Bushman et al. 2009). Conversely, mammalian cells also express a number of diverse, dominantly acting proteins that are widely expressed and function in a cell-autonomous manner to suppress virus replication. These have been termed restriction factors and/or intrinsic resistance factors, and they provide an initial (or early) line of defense against infection as a component of, or even preceding, innate antiviral responses. This work discusses the most extensively described examples of such factors, focusing on their impact on HIV-1. These are the apolipoprotein B messenger RNA (mRNA)-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (APOBEC3) family of proteins (in particular, APOBEC3G), tetherin/bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2 (BST2)/CD317 (hereafter called tetherin), and tripartite-motif-containing 5\u03b1 (TRIM5\u03b1).\nA fundamental concept to the biology of restriction factors is that HIV-1 generally evades their potent inhibitory activities in human cells, thereby allowing virus replication to proceed efficiently. In contrast, the ability of HIV-1 to replicate in nonhuman cells is often severely compromised by restriction factors, thus marking these proteins as important determinants of viral host range and cross-species transmission. The mechanisms for evasion from restriction factors are virus encoded and frequently involve HIV-1\u2019s regulatory/accessory proteins, namely, Vif, Nef, Vpu, and Vpr. Indeed, the need to escape intrinsic resistance appears to have been an important driving force behind the acquisition of these viral genes. Aside from restriction factor evasion, the Vpu and Nef proteins regulate the expression and localization of a number of host proteins important during HIV-1 replication. Prominent among these interactions, Vpu and Nef both inhibit the cell-surface expression of the primary entry receptor CD4, as well as major histocompatibility class I complexes (MHC class I), whereas Nef also helps promote T-cell activation and HIV-1 particle infectivity (reviewed by Kirchhoff 2010).\nThe intellectual framework for considering restriction factors was established through studies of ecotropic murine leukemia virus (MLV). Specifically, mice encode a gene, Fv1, with two principal allelic forms, Fv1n and Fv1b. Fv1n cells are up to 1000-fold more susceptible to infection by N-tropic strains of MLV than B-tropic strains, and Fv1n mice are correspondingly highly receptive to N-MLV induced disease. The opposite is true for Fv1b cells and animals, which are susceptible to B- rather than N-MLV. Heterozygous Fv1n/b cells are resistant to both N and B viruses, illustrating the general principle that a restricting phenotype is dominant over susceptibility. The sequence of the Fv1 gene most closely resembles that of an endogenous retrovirus gag gene (Best et al. 1996), Fv1 blocks infection by a poorly understood mechanism that operates after reverse transcription but before integration and likely requires direct recognition of infecting viral capsids, as N/B-tropism is determined by sequence differences in the capsid (CA) portion of the viral Gag protein.\nBeginning in the 1990s, sporadic evidence emerged that hinted at the existence of additional restriction factors, including factors affecting HIV-1. For instance, (1) virus infectivity or the capacity of viral accessory genes to function could be profoundly affected by the animal species of the cells under experimental examination (Simon et al. 1998b; Hofmann et al. 1999); and (2) the requirements for individual accessory genes during virus replication could vary enormously between human cell lines (Gabuzda et al. 1992; Varthakavi et al. 2003). Drawing on the Fv1 analogy, but recognizing the lack of similarity among the phenotypic manifestations of these replication barriers, the concept that primate cells express a range of restriction factors that target HIV-1 and other lentiviruses gradually gained acceptance.\nOne experimental approach that added weight to these arguments, and parallels the resistance of Fv1n/b cells to N- and B-MLV infection, is illustrated in Figure 1. Here, cells that are restrictive or susceptible for a viral function of step or replication (also called nonpermissive and permissive cells, respectively) are fused in vitro to form heterokaryons that consequently express the contents of both cells. The capacity of these cell hybrids to support the viral activity in question is then assessed. A restricting phenotype points to the presence of a dominant restriction factor that is absent from susceptible cells, whereas a susceptible phenotype suggests that a positively acting cofactor has been lost from the nonpermissive cells.

Although combination antiretroviral therapy (combination ART, or cART) allows people with HIV to live longer and in better health, it does not cure HIV. Investing in research to find a cure for HIV is focused on two broad aims: sustained viral remission and, in the longer term, viral eradication.\nViral latency and sanctuaries\nLatent HIV reservoirs\u2014small amounts of HIV that persist in people taking ART\u2014present a significant challenge to finding a cure for HIV. Latent reservoirs remain in people with HIV when HIV becomes part of the body\u2019s DNA in infected cells. Additionally, reservoirs of HIV can be found in certain \u201csanctuary\u201d sites in the body that allow the virus to hide and be protected from both the immune system and ART. To cure HIV, the NIH supports studies to develop novel approaches and treatments that target these HIV reservoirs.\nSustained viral remission and viral eradication\nPeople with HIV who adhere carefully to treatment with ART can have undetectable levels of HIV in their blood and be durably suppressed. These individuals are less likely to experience symptoms and complications and have effectively no risk of transmitting the virus. However, latent HIV remains and people must stay on treatment to maintain durable suppression of the virus.\nCurrent science suggests that the path to an HIV cure involves first achieving sustained viral remission without ART. This is called sustained ART-free viral remission or a functional cure. For sustained ART-free viral remission, infectious virus must remain undetectable by sensitive testing methods for a long time without treatment. One research aim will be to prolong the time between treatments to be measured eventually not in weeks, but in months or even years. The NIH supports research into treatments leading to sustained ART-free viral remission. New cure-inducing treatments must be as safe, effective, and available for widespread use as are current-day ART regimens.\nViral eradication\u2014eliminating the virus entirely\u2014is the more challenging, longer-term goal.\nResearch Strategies\nThe NIH supports research to better understand how the HIV reservoir forms, persists, and reactivates, as well as investigations to develop new cure treatment strategies targeting HIV reservoirs.\nA range of biomarkers and techniques, including single-cell and imaging technologies, are being studied to determine how to identify and describe the HIV reservoir. These techniques also are being used to better understand mechanisms of viral reactivation from latently infected cells.\nExperimental treatments in development include therapeutic vaccines, genetically engineered immune cells that are resistant to HIV infection, drugs that reactivate latent HIV to make the virus visible to the immune system, cure-inducing immunotherapies, and interventions to permanently silence HIV in infected cells.\nThe search for an HIV cure involves important behavioral and social processes that complement the domains of biomedicine. BSSR in HIV cure research is focused on important aspects such as: counseling and support interventions to address the psychosocial needs and concerns of study participants related to analytical treatment interruptions (ATIs); risk reduction in the course of ATI study participation; motivation, acceptability, and decision\u2010making processes of potential study participants; how cure affects the identity and social position of people with HIV; and the scalability of a proven cure strategy in the context of further advances in HIV prevention and treatment.\nSupporting research innovation and scientific stewardship\nThe NIH is leveraging resources toward an HIV cure through several public-private partnerships. NIH small business awards enable companies to help foster a diverse pipeline of experimental treatments in development. The combined support of government, industry, and nongovernmental foundations is fostering the expansion of a talented scientific workforce dedicated to advancing HIV cure research.\nThis page last reviewed on April 15, 2025\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) occurs at the most advanced stage of infection.\nHIV targets the body\u2019s white blood cells, weakening the immune system. This makes it easier to get sick with diseases like tuberculosis, infections and some cancers.\nHIV is spread from the body fluids of an infected person, including blood, breast milk, semen and vaginal fluids. It is not spread by kisses, hugs or sharing food. It can also spread from a mother to her baby.\nHIV can be prevented and treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART). Untreated HIV can progress to AIDS, often after many years.\nWHO now defines Advanced HIV Disease (AHD) as CD4 cell count less than 200 cells/mm3 or WHO stage 3 or 4 event in adults and adolescents. All children younger than 5 years of age living with HIV are considered to have advanced HIV disease, regardless of clinical or immunological status.\nThe signs and symptoms of HIV vary depending on the stage of infection.\nHIV spreads more easily in the first few months after a person is infected, but many are unaware of their status until the later stages. In the first few weeks after being infected people may not experience symptoms. Others may have an influenza-like illness including:\nThe infection progressively weakens the immune system. This can cause other signs and symptoms:\nWithout treatment, people living with HIV infection can also develop severe illnesses:\nHIV can make other infections, such as hepatitis C, hepatitis B and mpox, get worse.\nHIV can be transmitted via the exchange of body fluids from people living with HIV, including blood, breast milk, semen, and vaginal secretions. HIV can also be transmitted to a child during pregnancy and delivery. People cannot become infected with HIV through ordinary day-to-day contact such as kissing, hugging, shaking hands, or sharing personal objects, food or water.\nPeople living with HIV who are taking ART and have an undetectable viral load will not transmit HIV to their sexual partners. Early access to ART and support to remain on treatment is therefore critical not only to improve the health of people living with HIV but also to prevent HIV transmission.\nBehaviours and conditions that put people at greater risk of contracting HIV include:\nHIV can be diagnosed through rapid diagnostic tests that provide same-day results. This greatly facilitates early diagnosis and linkage with treatment and prevention. People can also use HIV self-tests to test themselves. However, no single test can provide a full HIV positive diagnosis; confirmatory testing is required, conducted by a qualified and trained health worker or community worker. HIV infection can be detected with great accuracy using WHO prequalified tests within a nationally approved testing strategy and algorithm.\nMost widely used HIV diagnostic tests detect antibodies produced by a person as part of their immune response to fight HIV. In most cases, people develop antibodies to HIV within 28 days of infection. During this time, people are in the so-called \u201cwindow period\u201d when they have low levels of antibodies which cannot be detected by many rapid tests, but they may still transmit HIV to others. People who have had a recent high-risk exposure and test negative can have a further test after 28 days.\nFollowing a positive diagnosis, people should be retested before they are enrolled in treatment and care to rule out any potential testing or reporting error. While testing for adolescents and adults has been made simple and efficient, this is not the case for babies born to HIV-positive mothers. For children less than 18 months of age, rapid antibody testing is not sufficient to identify HIV infection \u2013 virological testing must be provided as early as birth or at 6 weeks of age. New technologies are now available to perform this test at the point of care and enable same-day results, which will accelerate appropriate linkage with treatment and care.\nHIV is a preventable disease. The risk of HIV infection can be reduced by:\nPre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an additional prevention option. It is an antiretroviral medication used by HIV-negative people to reduce the risk of HIV acquisition. WHO recommends the following PrEP methods :\nARVs can also be used to prevent mothers from passing HIV to their children.\nPeople taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) and who have no evidence of virus in the blood will not pass HIV to their sexual partners. Access to testing and ART is an important part of preventing HIV.\nWhen given before possible exposures to HIV it is called pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and when given after an exposure it is called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). People can use PrEP or PEP when the risk of contracting HIV is high; people should seek advice from a clinician when thinking about using PrEP or PEP.\nThere is no cure for HIV infection. It is treated with antiretroviral drugs, which stop the virus from replicating in the body.\nCurrent antiretroviral therapy (ART) does not cure HIV infection but allows a person\u2019s immune system to get stronger. This helps them to fight other infections.\nCurrently, ART must be taken every day for the rest of a person\u2019s life.\nART lowers the amount of the virus in a person\u2019s body. This stops symptoms and allows people to live full and healthy lives. People living with HIV who are taking ART and who have no evidence of virus in the blood will not spread the virus to their sexual partners.\nPregnant women with HIV should have access to, and take, ART as soon as possible. This protects the health of the mother and will help prevent HIV transmission to the fetus before birth, or through breast milk.\nAdvanced HIV disease remains a persistent problem in the HIV response.

This activated T-cell response can inflict an overwhelming degree of damage to the targeted cells, which in most instances leads to the control and elimination of foreign invaders. However, in conditions of chronic infection, persistent exposure of T cells to high levels of antigen results in a severe T-cell dysfunctional state called exhaustion. T-cell exhaustion leads to a suboptimal immune-mediated control of multiple viral infections including the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In this review, we will discuss the role of T-cell exhaustion in HIV disease progression, the long-term defect of T-cell function even in aviremic patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART), the role of exhaustion-specific markers in maintaining a reservoir of latently infected cells, and exploiting these markers in HIV cure strategies.\nThe T-cell activation paradigm proceeds in a highly organized process involving three signals consisting of antigen recognition, receptor costimulation, and a termination signal that are required for the tight regulation of a strong functional and proliferative response.\nSignal one in T-cell activation represents the specific recognition through the T-cell receptor (TCR) of their cognate antigen presented by professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) including dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells.\nSignal two is the costimulatory signal where receptors on the T cells bind to their counterpart ligands. CD28 is the primary costimulatory receptor for T cells that acts through interaction with its ligands, CD80 and CD86 expressed on APCs. Costimulation is essential for T-cell activation since signal one TCR/antigen recognition in the absence of signal two drives the cell toward an anergic and/or tolerogenic state.1 Additional costimulatory receptors that can enhance T-cell activation include CD27, OX40 (CD134), ICOS (CD278), CD40L (CD154), CD226 that bind to CD70, OX40L (CD252), B7-H2 (CD275), CD40, and CD155/CD112, respectively, on APCs.2 The concentration of costimulatory and ligand molecules can vary significantly such that either no positive signal is sent or a paired interaction provides a strong supporting signal two to the T cells. Soluble pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-12 and type I interferons contribute to a fully activated T-cell response.\nSignal three arises in the days following T-cell activation, the effector phase of the immune response, and eventually the elimination of the pathogen. Signal three is responsible for terminating the immune response. Inhibitory receptors, also called immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), exert their influence on T-cell activation at this stage where under normal conditions, ICIs including programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1), cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), LAG3 (lymphocyte activation gene protein), and TIM3 (T-cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain-containing protein 3) are transiently upregulated on the surface of effector T cells within hours to days following T-cell activation. Here, their purpose is to attenuate T-cell activation and limit immune function at the end stages of an acute infection when a pathogen is controlled. Upon clearance of antigen, the expression of these ICIs on memory T cells declines to normal levels over time. Termination of the T-cell response is an essential self-limiting mechanisms to help preserve self-tolerance. However, in the case of chronic infection or cancer when the immune response is incapable of clearing the foreign antigen and there persistent chronic stimulation, T cells can enter a dysfunctional state called exhaustion.\nT-cell exhaustion is a progressive condition with increasing loss in effector function coinciding with increased expression levels and assortment of ICIs. PD-1 is recognized as the master inhibitory regulator of T-cell function but with increased degrees of exhaustion comes elevated levels of additional ICIs including CTLA-4, TIM3, LAG3, T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT), 2B4 (CD244), and CD1603, 4 (Figure 1). T-cell exhaustion mediated through PD-1 relies on interaction with its cognate ligands, PDL-1 and PD-L2, which regulate the delicate balance between immune defense and the protection of healthy tissue. Immune cells, non-immune endothelial, and epithelial cells constitutively express PDL-1, while PDL-2 expression is limited to APCs. The expression of PDL-1 is further upregulated after activation, which modulates the immune responses against self and foreign antigens.5 In a likewise fashion, the interaction of additional ICIs with their respective ligands exert a further level of control and suppression of T-cell function.\nIn exhausted CD8 T cells, the increased expression of ICIs leads to a hierarchical loss of function that begins with reduced IL-2 secretion, cytokine polyfunctionality, and diminished proliferative potential. Functional defects progress to the loss in cytotoxic capacity and TNF-\u03b1 secretion with highly exhausted cells having reduced ability to produce IFN-\u03b3.6-8 Although T-cell exhaustion was first identified in CD8 T cells, it is now accepted that CD4 T cells are also subject to exhaustion leading to reduced production of IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b19-11 along with reduced CD4 T-cell help.12 In addition to persistent antigen and pathogen burden, the loss or reduction of CD4 T-cell help is an important factor that contributes to the initial establishment of exhaustion.13-15 The precise nature of optimal CD4 T-cell help needed to antagonize exhaustion is unclear, but is likely to involve the production of IL-2 and IL-21 cytokines that support CD8 T-cell response both directly and indirectly through activation of APCs.16\nAside from a blunted immune response against infected or cancerous cells, exhausted T cells have a poor or varied response to homeostatic cytokines including IL-7 and IL-15 r\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

HIV infects and destroys immune cells called CD4 T cells or T helper cells. Overtime the number of your immune cells will decrease as they are killed by the virus, which leads to AIDS. AIDS is when your immune system is significantly weakened by the virus, and you start to experience complications of a weakened immune system. Today, HIV treatment is highly effective at preventing HIV infection from progressing to AIDS and allowing people living with HIV to lead long lives.\nGlobally: In 2024, 40.8 million people worldwide were living with HIV and 1.3 million new people became infected with the virus.\nUS incidence: In 2024, 1.2 million people in the US were living with HIV and 31,800 new people became infected with the virus.\nSince the beginning of the HIV epidemic in 1981, 91.4 million people have been infected with the virus and 44.1 million have died from HIV-related causes.\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus that infects and destroys immune cells. HIV spreads through contact with bodily fluids including blood, semen, vaginal fluids, and breastmilk. This means HIV can spread through activities such as unprotected sex, sharing needles or syringes, or from mother to baby.\nOnce HIV enters the body, it infects T helper cells (also known as CD4 T cells). When HIV enters a T helper cell, it permanently inserts its viral DNA into the cell\u2019s DNA. The virus has now hijacked the T helper cell, using it to make more copies of the virus. The viral DNA from HIV also becomes permanently part of an infected T helper cell\u2019s DNA. This makes it very difficult for the immune system to find and kill the virus. Because of HIV\u2019s ability to quickly hide within your cells and because it mutates very often, developing a vaccine to prevent HIV is very challenging.\nThe first stage of HIV infection is called acute HIV. This is when someone is first infected with HIV and may experience mild flu-like symptoms or no symptoms at all. This can then progress to chronic infection where HIV will continue to replicate inside T helper cells, slowly killing them and infecting more cells. At this stage, it\u2019s likely that the infected person won\u2019t experience any noticeable symptoms. During this time, they can still transmit HIV, even if they don\u2019t realize they have it.\nHIV infection can affect anyone. To learn more or be tested for the virus, talk to a doctor or visit a local health clinic.\nThe final stage of HIV infection is acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). This is when the number of T helper cells becomes very low. This happens years after initial infection and the immune system has been severely weakened by the virus. The T helper cells that HIV infects and destroys are crucial for activating other immune cells to coordinate an immune response. As the number of T helper cells decreases, the immune system becomes weaker, unable to fight off simple infections or prevent the development of cancer.\nA person with AIDS is more likely to get opportunistic infections, which are infections a healthy immune system could normally prevent. They are also more likely to develop certain types of cancer. These infections and cancers are called AIDS-defining illnesses. They occur because the T helper cells that are supposed to help initiate immune responses are too weak to respond. Some examples include Kaposi sarcoma, tuberculosis, or chronic herpes ulcers.\nHIV treatment and prevention have come a long way, but there is no cure. Today, HIV treatment can prevent HIV infection from progressing to AIDS. When taking HIV treatment as prescribed, many people live long lives. Treatment can even reduce HIV to undetectable levels in person, meaning there is so little virus active in your blood that a test cannot detect it. This doesn\u2019t mean you are cured, but it does mean your treatment is working very effectively. Researchers have even determined that when HIV levels are undetectable and stay undetectable, the virus cannot be transmitted. Immunology research over the last 40 years contributed to these major advancements in HIV treatment that allow people to live decades with little to no symptoms of HIV infection.\nImmunology research is continuing to advance HIV treatments and even help find a cure for the infection. Immunotherapy, treatment that enhances the immune system\u2019s ability to fight disease, is providing promise for people with HIV. A study in 2022, found that a cancer immunotherapy, pembrolizumab, can reverse HIV\u2019s ability to hide in immune cells. The virus\u2019s ability to hide is a major barrier to curing HIV, and immunotherapies like this may be a key step in reaching a cure.\nmRNA vaccines are also showing incredible promise in curing HIV. One study found that mRNA can be delivered to the cells where HIV is hiding and provide instructions to the cell that reveal the virus. Being able to reveal the virus and prevent it from hiding can lead to drugs that permanently eliminate HIV from the body. Another study using mRNA vaccines, successfully trained the immune system to recognize and fight HIV, a major battle in developing successful HIV vaccines. With continued advances in immunology and personalized medicine, researchers hope new technology like mRNA vaccines and immunotherpay will finally lead to a cure for HIV.\nThe American Association of Immunologists (\u201cAAI\u201d) websites (www.aai.org, www.immunologyexplained.org, and all related webpages, the \u201cWebsites\u201d) include information meant to inform visitors (\u201cUsers\u201d) about immunology and its related disciplines.

The capsid protein (CA) is the primary structural protein of HIV-1 and plays multiple functions during infection. Early studies predicted that HIV-1 CA mainly protected and delivered the viral genome to the target cell. However, it is now well established that CA plays a critical role after the cellular entry steps of infection. During the early stages, CA promotes reverse transcription of the RNA genome into a DNA copy and the nuclear import/entry step of HIV-1 infection. Emerging evidence also supports the functional role of CA in the post-nuclear entry steps of infection, such as HIV-1 integration. During the late stages of infection, CA coordinates hexameric lattice formation for the assembly of immature virion. CA also regulates theformation of the mature capsid that encases the viral genome and associated factors in the infectious progeny virion. Because of these indispensable roles, HIV-1 CA has emerged as a new and validated target for antiviral drug development. Accordingly, the first CA-targeting drug, lenacapavir (GS-6207), was recently approved to treat certain HIV-1-infected individuals whose viral load cannot be controlled by other antiviral drugs. Still, new and superior CA inhibitors are needed to qualify as part of the front-line antiviral therapy regimens for all infected individuals. The development of such inhibitors requires a clear understanding of CA\u2019s role in HIV-1 infection. In this review, we will describe CA\u2019s role during the early stages of HIV-1 infection, with particular emphasis on post-nuclear entry steps. IMPORTANCE HIV-1 capsid protein (CA)\u2014independently or by recruiting host factors\u2014mediates several key steps of virus replication in the cytoplasm and nucleus of the target cell. Research in the recent years have established that CA is multifunctional and genetically fragile of all the HIV-1 proteins. Accordingly, CA has emerged as a validated and high priority therapeutic target, and the first CA-targeting antiviral drug was recently approved for treating multi-drug resistant HIV-1 infection. However, development of next generation CA inhibitors depends on a better understanding of CA\u2019s known roles, as well as probing of CA\u2019s novel roles, in HIV-1 replication. In this timely review, we present an updated overview of the current state of our understanding of CA\u2019s multifunctional role in HIV-1 replication\u2014with a special emphasis on CA\u2019s newfound post-nuclear roles, highlight the pressing knowledge gaps, and discuss directions for future research. INTRODUCTION Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is the causative agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (1\u20133). The HIV/AIDS pandemic has been responsible for ~40 million deaths, with an additional ~39 million people currently infected with the virus (4). HIV-1 infects immune cells, such as T lymphocytes, monocytes, and macrophages, that express the CD4 receptor and CCR5 or CXCR4 chemokine co-receptors (5\u201311). As a consequence of HIV-1 infection, the number of CD4+ T cells is progressively declining in infected individuals, leading to systemic failure of the immune system, a hallmark of progression to AIDS (12). Fortunately, antiviral therapy (ART) that uses a combination of two to three different drugs has been highly effective in controlling HIV-1 infection and preventing AIDS-related death. Yet, ART is not curative, faces drug resistance, and is often toxic. Thus, a clear understanding of the molecular interactions between HIV-1 and the host will help identify new antiviral drug targets. HIV-1 infection is broadly categorized into early and late stages. The early stages include the steps of cellular entry, reverse transcription, nuclear entry, and integration. The late stages involve viral RNA transcription, viral protein production, and the assembly, budding, release, and maturation of progeny virions (13\u201318). HIV-1 infection is initiated when the viral envelope (Env) glycoprotein binds to the CD4 and CCR5/CXCR4 expressed on the plasma membrane of the target immune cells (19, 20). Subsequently, the viral membrane fuses with the plasma membrane of the target cell, resulting in the release of the viral capsid into the cytoplasm (21). The core of the HIV-1 capsid contains two copies of a linear single-stranded (ss) viral RNA genome and a number of other key viral and cellular factors required for the post-entry steps of infection (22\u201327). The cytoplasmic release of the capsid coincides with the reverse transcription step, where the reverse transcription complex (RTC) containing the viral reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme starts the conversion of the viral ssRNA into a double-stranded (ds) DNA copy (28). By an unknown mechanism and undefined time, the RTC transitions into a pre-integration complex (PIC). The PIC contains the viral DNA and associated cellular and viral factors, including the viral integrase (IN) enzyme (29). The general and longstanding understanding in the field has been that the PIC containing the reverse-transcribed viral DNA is transported across the nuclear pore complex\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Reverse transcription is an essential step in retroviral replication. This article presents an overview of reverse transcription, briefly describes the structure and function of RT, provides an introduction to some of the cellular and viral factors that can affect reverse transcription, and discusses fidelity and recombination, two processes in which reverse transcription plays an important role. In keeping with the theme of the collection, the emphasis is on HIV-1 and HIV-1 RT.\nMore than half of the drugs currently approved to treat HIV-1 infections are reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Therefore, the continued characterization of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and the process of reverse transcription is vital.\nIt has been 40 years since the discovery of reverse transcriptase (RT) was announced by Howard Temin and David Baltimore, who independently showed that retroviral virions contain an enzymatic activity that can copy RNA into DNA (Baltimore 1970; Mizutani et al. 1970). These experiments provided the crucial proof of Temin\u2019s provirus hypothesis that retroviral infections persist because the RNA genome found in the virions is converted into DNA (Temin 1964). The sequences of the genomes of eukaryotes show how pervasive reverse transcription is in nature; not only do these genomes contain large numbers of endogenous retroviruses, but also a variety of retroposons and reverse-transcribed elements. The discovery in the early 1980s, that AIDS is caused by a human retrovirus, HIV-1, invigorated retroviral research and focused attention on the viral enzymes, which have become the primary target of anti-AIDS drugs. Not surprisingly, the focus of RT research shifted from the RTs of the murine leukemia viruses (MLV) and the avian myeloblastosis virus to HIV-1 RT. The first approved anti-HIV drug, AZT, targets RT, and of the 26 drugs currently approved to treat HIV-1 infections, 14 are RT inhibitors. In addition, RTs (primarily recombinant MLV RTs) have become extremely valuable tools that are widely used in research, in clinical/diagnostic tests, and in biotechnology. We provide here a relatively brief description of the process of reverse transcription, the structure and biochemical functions of RT, some information about how other viral and cellular factors influence reverse transcription, and briefly consider how the reverse transcription process affects both the mutations that arise during the retroviral life cycle and recombination. The focus will be HIV-1 and HIV-1 RT; however, in some cases, we will draw on insights and include information obtained with other retroviruses and other RTs. Although the issues of the inhibition of HIV-1 RT by anti-RT drugs and the mechanisms of drug resistance are of considerable importance, these issues will not be addressed in detail here; the reader is directed to Arts and Hazuda (2011). Given that the literature on RT and reverse transcription is both vast and complex, and the space allowed for this article is limited, we have had to make some difficult choices in what to present, and what to omit, both in terms of the material and the references. For the omissions, we apologize.\nWhen a mature HIV-1 virion infects a susceptible target cell, interactions of the envelope glycoprotein with the coreceptors on the surface of the cell brings about a fusion of the membranes of the host cell and the virion (Wilen et al. 2011). This fusion introduces the contents of the virion into the cytoplasm of the cell, setting the stage for reverse transcription. There are complexities to the early events that accompany reverse transcription in an infected cell, not all of which are well understood, which will be considered later in this article. We will begin by discussing the mechanics of the conversion of the single-stranded RNA genome found in the virion into the linear double-stranded DNA that is the substrate for the integration process. The synthesis of this linear DNA is a reasonably well-understood process; additional details and references can be found in the books Retroviruses (Telesnitsky and Goff 1997) and Reverse Transcriptase (Skalka and Goff 1993). In orthoretroviruses, including HIV-1, reverse transcription takes place in newly infected cells. There is some debate in the literature about whether reverse transcription is initiated in producer cells. Primer tagging experiments suggest that most HIV-1 virions initiate reverse transcription in newly infected cells (Whitcomb et al. 1990); however, there are claims that a small number of nucleotides may be incorporated before the virions initiate infection of target cells (Lori et al. 1992; Trono 1992; Zhu and Cunningham 1993; Huang et al. 1997). Either way, the vast majority of the viral DNA is synthesized in newly infected cells. This is a lifestyle choice; spumaretroviruses and the more distantly related hepadna viruses carry out extensive reverse transcription in producer cells (Summers and Mason 1982; Yu et al. 1996, 1999). Although there are viral and cellular factors that assist in the process of reverse transcription (these will be discussed later) the two enzymatic activities that are necessary and sufficient to carry out reverse transcription are present in RT. These are a DNA polymerase that can copy either a RNA or a DNA template, and an RNase H that degrades RNA if, and only if, it is part of an RNA\u2013DNA duplex.\nLike many other DNA polymerases, RT needs both a primer and a template. Genomic RNA is plus-stranded (the genome and the messages are copied from the same DNA strand), and the primer for the synthesis of the first DNA strand (the minus strand) is a host tRNA whose 3\u2032 end is base paired to a compl\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

In addition, detailed information about each antiretroviral medication and for all fixed-dose combinations is available in the Antiretroviral Medication section of this website.\nUnderstanding the basic HIV life cycle is the foundation for understanding the mechanism of action of the different classes of antiretroviral medications. The following discussion will focus on key HIV enzymes and relevant steps in the HIV life cycle related to HIV antiretroviral therapy. The Howard Hughes Medical Institute has produced an excellent HIV Life Cycle video (below) that summarizes the key steps in the HIV life cycle.\nThe initial step in the HIV life cycle involves a complex interaction between HIV envelope spikes and host surface proteins. The HIV envelope consists of two structural components: surface envelope glycoprotein (gp120) and transmembrane envelope glycoprotein (gp41) (Figure 2).[9] The surface of HIV is studded with approximately 14 envelope spikes, with each spike consisting of a trimer of three gp120 and gp41 subunits.[10,11] Both gp120 and gp41 play an essential role in HIV entry into the host cell.\nThe HIV entry process involves a sequential and coordinated interaction between the virus and the host cell that includes three key steps: (1) attachment of HIV gp120 with the host CD4 receptor, (2) HIV gp120-host chemokine coreceptor binding, and (3) gp41-mediated fusion of HIV with the host surface membrane.[9,15]\nThe FDA-approved HIV entry inhibitors include four subclasses: (1) CD4 attachment inhibitors; (2) CD4 postattachment inhibitors, (3) CCR5 coreceptor antagonists, and (4) fusion inhibitors.[17,18] Note that the CD4 attachment inhibitor and the fusion inhibitor bind directly to HIV, whereas the postattachment inhibitor and the CCR5 coreceptor bind human cell surface receptors.(Figure 5) Figure 5. Mechanism of Action of Entry Inhibitors 5A 5B 5C 5D Figure 5A. Mechanism of Action of Attachment Inhibitors: Fostemsavir The attachment inhibitor fostemsavir is hydrolyzed to its active form temsavir, which binds to HIV gp120 and prevents attachment between HIV gp120 and the host cell CD4 receptor. Illustration: Cognition Studio, Inc. and David H. Spach, MD Figure 5B. Mechanism of Action of CD4 Postattachment Inhibitors: Ibalizumab The CD4 postattachment inhibitor ibalizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the domain 2 region of the human CD4 cell receptor. This binding does not prevent attachment of HIV gp120 with the host CD4 receptor, but, through steric hindrance, it prevents normal postbinding conformational changes in HIV gp120 that are required for gp120-host cell coreceptor binding. Illustration: Cognition Studio, Inc. and David H. Spach, MD Figure 5C. Mechanism of Action of CCR5 Antagonists: Maraviroc The CCR5 antagonist maraviroc binds to the host CCR5 coreceptor, rendering a conformational change in the coreceptor, which causes unfavorable binding of the V3 region of gp120 in the R5 strains of HIV. Illustration: Cognition Studio, Inc. and David H. Spach, MD Figure 5D. Mechanism of Action of Fusion Inhibitor: Enfuvirtide The fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide is a 36-amino-acid peptide that represents a segment of the HIV gp41 HR2 domain. In the native gp41 configuration, a segment of gp41 folds back on itself and this involves tight coiling of the HR1 and HR2 segments. The drug enfuvirtide mimics the HR2 segment and binds to HR1, thus interfering with the normal HR1 and HR2 interaction. Illustration: Cognition Studio, Inc. and David H. Spach, MD\nThe HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme catalyzes the critical HIV reverse transcription process. This enzyme is a heterodimer consisting of the p66 and p51 subunits; the p66 and p51 subunits are 560 and 440 amino acids in length, respectively, with the 440 amino acids of p51 overlapping with the first 440 amino acids of the p66 subunit (Figure 6).[29,30] The p66 subunit, which primarily has a catalytic role, consists of the polymerase and RNase H domains. Conceptually, the polymerase domain is structurally analogous to a human right hand, with specific regions corresponding to fingers, palm, and thumb.[30] The p51 subunit has a structural role, and is very closely related, but not identical to, the polymerase domain of the p66 subunit. Each HIV-1 virion contains approximately 50 reverse transcriptase enzymes.[29] Figure 6. Structure of HIV Reverse Transcriptase 6A 6B 6C 6D Figure 6A. HIV Reverse Transcriptase: p66 and p51 Subunits Reverse transcriptase is a DNA polymerase heterodimer comprised of p66 and p51 subunits. The p66 and p51 subunits are 560 and 440 amino acids in length, respectively. These two subunits share the same first 440 amino acids. Illustration: Cognition Studio, Inc. and David H.

This article presents an overview of reverse transcription, briefly describes the structure and function of RT, provides an introduction to some of the cellular and viral factors that can affect reverse transcription, and discusses fidelity and recombination, two processes in which reverse transcription plays an important role. In keeping with the theme of the collection, the emphasis is on HIV-1 and HIV-1 RT.\nMore than half of the drugs currently approved to treat HIV-1 infections are reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Therefore, the continued characterization of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and the process of reverse transcription is vital.\nIt has been 40 years since the discovery of reverse transcriptase (RT) was announced by Howard Temin and David Baltimore, who independently showed that retroviral virions contain an enzymatic activity that can copy RNA into DNA (Baltimore 1970; Mizutani et al. 1970). These experiments provided the crucial proof of Temin\u2019s provirus hypothesis that retroviral infections persist because the RNA genome found in the virions is converted into DNA (Temin 1964). The sequences of the genomes of eukaryotes show how pervasive reverse transcription is in nature; not only do these genomes contain large numbers of endogenous retroviruses, but also a variety of retroposons and reverse-transcribed elements. The discovery in the early 1980s, that AIDS is caused by a human retrovirus, HIV-1, invigorated retroviral research and focused attention on the viral enzymes, which have become the primary target of anti-AIDS drugs. Not surprisingly, the focus of RT research shifted from the RTs of the murine leukemia viruses (MLV) and the avian myeloblastosis virus to HIV-1 RT. The first approved anti-HIV drug, AZT, targets RT, and of the 26 drugs currently approved to treat HIV-1 infections, 14 are RT inhibitors. In addition, RTs (primarily recombinant MLV RTs) have become extremely valuable tools that are widely used in research, in clinical/diagnostic tests, and in biotechnology. We provide here a relatively brief description of the process of reverse transcription, the structure and biochemical functions of RT, some information about how other viral and cellular factors influence reverse transcription, and briefly consider how the reverse transcription process affects both the mutations that arise during the retroviral life cycle and recombination. The focus will be HIV-1 and HIV-1 RT; however, in some cases, we will draw on insights and include information obtained with other retroviruses and other RTs. Although the issues of the inhibition of HIV-1 RT by anti-RT drugs and the mechanisms of drug resistance are of considerable importance, these issues will not be addressed in detail here; the reader is directed to Arts and Hazuda (2011). Given that the literature on RT and reverse transcription is both vast and complex, and the space allowed for this article is limited, we have had to make some difficult choices in what to present, and what to omit, both in terms of the material and the references. For the omissions, we apologize.\nWhen a mature HIV-1 virion infects a susceptible target cell, interactions of the envelope glycoprotein with the coreceptors on the surface of the cell brings about a fusion of the membranes of the host cell and the virion (Wilen et al. 2011). This fusion introduces the contents of the virion into the cytoplasm of the cell, setting the stage for reverse transcription. There are complexities to the early events that accompany reverse transcription in an infected cell, not all of which are well understood, which will be considered later in this article. We will begin by discussing the mechanics of the conversion of the single-stranded RNA genome found in the virion into the linear double-stranded DNA that is the substrate for the integration process. The synthesis of this linear DNA is a reasonably well-understood process; additional details and references can be found in the books Retroviruses (Telesnitsky and Goff 1997) and Reverse Transcriptase (Skalka and Goff 1993). In orthoretroviruses, including HIV-1, reverse transcription takes place in newly infected cells. There is some debate in the literature about whether reverse transcription is initiated in producer cells. Primer tagging experiments suggest that most HIV-1 virions initiate reverse transcription in newly infected cells (Whitcomb et al. 1990); however, there are claims that a small number of nucleotides may be incorporated before the virions initiate infection of target cells (Lori et al. 1992; Trono 1992; Zhu and Cunningham 1993; Huang et al. 1997). Either way, the vast majority of the viral DNA is synthesized in newly infected cells. This is a lifestyle choice; spumaretroviruses and the more distantly related hepadna viruses carry out extensive reverse transcription in producer cells (Summers and Mason 1982; Yu et al. 1996, 1999). Although there are viral and cellular factors that assist in the process of reverse transcription (these will be discussed later) the two enzymatic activities that are necessary and sufficient to carry out reverse transcription are present in RT. These are a DNA polymerase that can copy either a RNA or a DNA template, and an RNase H that degrades RNA if, and only if, it is part of an RNA\u2013DNA duplex.\nLike many other DNA polymerases, RT needs both a primer and a template. Genomic RNA is plus-stranded (the genome and the messages are copied from the same DNA strand), and the primer for the synthesis of the first DNA strand (the minus strand) is a host tRNA whose 3\u2032 end is base paired to a compl\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Persons with HIV who take modern combination antiretroviral therapy and maintain virologic suppression significantly reduce their HIV-associated morbidity and mortality,[1,2,3] and do not transmit HIV to others.[4,5,6] The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved medications in six different classes to treat HIV infection: entry inhibitors, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs), protease inhibitors (PIs), and capsid inhibitors(Figure 1).[7,8] This Topic Review will summarize the mechanism of action of antiretroviral medications, indications for antiretroviral therapy, and recommended antiretroviral regimens for treatment-na\u00efve individuals. Separate Topic Reviews will address other issues related to antiretroviral therapy, including adverse effects, drug interactions, simplifying or switching therapy, assessment of drug resistance, and management of virologic failure. In addition, detailed information about each antiretroviral medication and for all fixed-dose combinations is available in the Antiretroviral Medication section of this website.\nUnderstanding the basic HIV life cycle is the foundation for understanding the mechanism of action of the different classes of antiretroviral medications. The following discussion will focus on key HIV enzymes and relevant steps in the HIV life cycle related to HIV antiretroviral therapy. The Howard Hughes Medical Institute has produced an excellent HIV Life Cycle video (below) that summarizes the key steps in the HIV life cycle.\nThe initial step in the HIV life cycle involves a complex interaction between HIV envelope spikes and host surface proteins. The HIV envelope consists of two structural components: surface envelope glycoprotein (gp120) and transmembrane envelope glycoprotein (gp41) (Figure 2).[9] The surface of HIV is studded with approximately 14 envelope spikes, with each spike consisting of a trimer of three gp120 and gp41 subunits.[10,11] Both gp120 and gp41 play an essential role in HIV entry into the host cell.\nThe HIV entry process involves a sequential and coordinated interaction between the virus and the host cell that includes three key steps: (1) attachment of HIV gp120 with the host CD4 receptor, (2) HIV gp120-host chemokine coreceptor binding, and (3) gp41-mediated fusion of HIV with the host surface membrane.[9,15]\nThe FDA-approved HIV entry inhibitors include four subclasses: (1) CD4 attachment inhibitors; (2) CD4 postattachment inhibitors, (3) CCR5 coreceptor antagonists, and (4) fusion inhibitors.[17,18] Note that the CD4 attachment inhibitor and the fusion inhibitor bind directly to HIV, whereas the postattachment inhibitor and the CCR5 coreceptor bind human cell surface receptors.(Figure 5) Figure 5. Mechanism of Action of Entry Inhibitors 5A 5B 5C 5D Figure 5A. Mechanism of Action of Attachment Inhibitors: Fostemsavir The attachment inhibitor fostemsavir is hydrolyzed to its active form temsavir, which binds to HIV gp120 and prevents attachment between HIV gp120 and the host cell CD4 receptor. Illustration: Cognition Studio, Inc. and David H. Spach, MD Figure 5B. Mechanism of Action of CD4 Postattachment Inhibitors: Ibalizumab The CD4 postattachment inhibitor ibalizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the domain 2 region of the human CD4 cell receptor. This binding does not prevent attachment of HIV gp120 with the host CD4 receptor, but, through steric hindrance, it prevents normal postbinding conformational changes in HIV gp120 that are required for gp120-host cell coreceptor binding. Illustration: Cognition Studio, Inc. and David H. Spach, MD Figure 5C. Mechanism of Action of CCR5 Antagonists: Maraviroc The CCR5 antagonist maraviroc binds to the host CCR5 coreceptor, rendering a conformational change in the coreceptor, which causes unfavorable binding of the V3 region of gp120 in the R5 strains of HIV. Illustration: Cognition Studio, Inc. and David H. Spach, MD Figure 5D. Mechanism of Action of Fusion Inhibitor: Enfuvirtide The fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide is a 36-amino-acid peptide that represents a segment of the HIV gp41 HR2 domain. In the native gp41 configuration, a segment of gp41 folds back on itself and this involves tight coiling of the HR1 and HR2 segments.

The Howard Hughes Medical Institute has produced an excellent HIV Life Cycle video (below) that summarizes the key steps in the HIV life cycle.\nThe initial step in the HIV life cycle involves a complex interaction between HIV envelope spikes and host surface proteins. The HIV envelope consists of two structural components: surface envelope glycoprotein (gp120) and transmembrane envelope glycoprotein (gp41) (Figure 2).[9] The surface of HIV is studded with approximately 14 envelope spikes, with each spike consisting of a trimer of three gp120 and gp41 subunits.[10,11] Both gp120 and gp41 play an essential role in HIV entry into the host cell.\nThe HIV entry process involves a sequential and coordinated interaction between the virus and the host cell that includes three key steps: (1) attachment of HIV gp120 with the host CD4 receptor, (2) HIV gp120-host chemokine coreceptor binding, and (3) gp41-mediated fusion of HIV with the host surface membrane.[9,15]\nThe FDA-approved HIV entry inhibitors include four subclasses: (1) CD4 attachment inhibitors; (2) CD4 postattachment inhibitors, (3) CCR5 coreceptor antagonists, and (4) fusion inhibitors.[17,18] Note that the CD4 attachment inhibitor and the fusion inhibitor bind directly to HIV, whereas the postattachment inhibitor and the CCR5 coreceptor bind human cell surface receptors.(Figure 5) Figure 5.

The capsid protein (CA) is the primary structural protein of HIV-1 and plays multiple functions during infection. Early studies predicted that HIV-1 CA mainly protected and delivered the viral genome to the target cell. However, it is now well established that CA plays a critical role after the cellular entry steps of infection. During the early stages, CA promotes reverse transcription of the RNA genome into a DNA copy and the nuclear import/entry step of HIV-1 infection. Emerging evidence also supports the functional role of CA in the post-nuclear entry steps of infection, such as HIV-1 integration. During the late stages of infection, CA coordinates hexameric lattice formation for the assembly of immature virion. CA also regulates theformation of the mature capsid that encases the viral genome and associated factors in the infectious progeny virion. Because of these indispensable roles, HIV-1 CA has emerged as a new and validated target for antiviral drug development. Accordingly, the first CA-targeting drug, lenacapavir (GS-6207), was recently approved to treat certain HIV-1-infected individuals whose viral load cannot be controlled by other antiviral drugs. Still, new and superior CA inhibitors are needed to qualify as part of the front-line antiviral therapy regimens for all infected individuals. The development of such inhibitors requires a clear understanding of CA\u2019s role in HIV-1 infection. In this review, we will describe CA\u2019s role during the early stages of HIV-1 infection, with particular emphasis on post-nuclear entry steps. IMPORTANCE HIV-1 capsid protein (CA)\u2014independently or by recruiting host factors\u2014mediates several key steps of virus replication in the cytoplasm and nucleus of the target cell. Research in the recent years have established that CA is multifunctional and genetically fragile of all the HIV-1 proteins. Accordingly, CA has emerged as a validated and high priority therapeutic target, and the first CA-targeting antiviral drug was recently approved for treating multi-drug resistant HIV-1 infection. However, development of next generation CA inhibitors depends on a better understanding of CA\u2019s known roles, as well as probing of CA\u2019s novel roles, in HIV-1 replication. In this timely review, we present an updated overview of the current state of our understanding of CA\u2019s multifunctional role in HIV-1 replication\u2014with a special emphasis on CA\u2019s newfound post-nuclear roles, highlight the pressing knowledge gaps, and discuss directions for future research. INTRODUCTION Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is the causative agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (1\u20133). The HIV/AIDS pandemic has been responsible for ~40 million deaths, with an additional ~39 million people currently infected with the virus (4). HIV-1 infects immune cells, such as T lymphocytes, monocytes, and macrophages, that express the CD4 receptor and CCR5 or CXCR4 chemokine co-receptors (5\u201311). As a consequence of HIV-1 infection, the number of CD4+ T cells is progressively declining in infected individuals, leading to systemic failure of the immune system, a hallmark of progression to AIDS (12). Fortunately, antiviral therapy (ART) that uses a combination of two to three different drugs has been highly effective in controlling HIV-1 infection and preventing AIDS-related death. Yet, ART is not curative, faces drug resistance, and is often toxic. Thus, a clear understanding of the molecular interactions between HIV-1 and the host will help identify new antiviral drug targets. HIV-1 infection is broadly categorized into early and late stages. The early stages include the steps of cellular entry, reverse transcription, nuclear entry, and integration. The late stages involve viral RNA transcription, viral protein production, and the assembly, budding, release, and maturation of progeny virions (13\u201318). HIV-1 infection is initiated when the viral envelope (Env) glycoprotein binds to the CD4 and CCR5/CXCR4 expressed on the plasma membrane of the target immune cells (19, 20). Subsequently, the viral membrane fuses with the plasma membrane of the target cell, resulting in the release of the viral capsid into the cytoplasm (21). The core of the HIV-1 capsid contains two copies of a linear single-stranded (ss) viral RNA genome and a number of other key viral and cellular factors required for the post-entry steps of infection (22\u201327). The cytoplasmic release of the capsid coincides with the reverse transcription step, where the reverse transcription complex (RTC) containing the viral reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme starts the conversion of the viral ssRNA into a double-stranded (ds) DNA copy (28). By an unknown mechanism and undefined time, the RTC transitions into a pre-integration complex (PIC). The PIC contains the viral DNA and associated cellular and viral factors, including the viral integrase (IN) enzyme (29). The general and longstanding understanding in the field has been that the PIC containing the reverse-transcribed viral DNA is transported across the nuclear pore complex\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

HIV infects and destroys immune cells called CD4 T cells or T helper cells. Overtime the number of your immune cells will decrease as they are killed by the virus, which leads to AIDS. AIDS is when your immune system is significantly weakened by the virus, and you start to experience complications of a weakened immune system. Today, HIV treatment is highly effective at preventing HIV infection from progressing to AIDS and allowing people living with HIV to lead long lives.\nGlobally: In 2024, 40.8 million people worldwide were living with HIV and 1.3 million new people became infected with the virus.\nUS incidence: In 2024, 1.2 million people in the US were living with HIV and 31,800 new people became infected with the virus.\nSince the beginning of the HIV epidemic in 1981, 91.4 million people have been infected with the virus and 44.1 million have died from HIV-related causes.\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus that infects and destroys immune cells. HIV spreads through contact with bodily fluids including blood, semen, vaginal fluids, and breastmilk. This means HIV can spread through activities such as unprotected sex, sharing needles or syringes, or from mother to baby.\nOnce HIV enters the body, it infects T helper cells (also known as CD4 T cells). When HIV enters a T helper cell, it permanently inserts its viral DNA into the cell\u2019s DNA. The virus has now hijacked the T helper cell, using it to make more copies of the virus. The viral DNA from HIV also becomes permanently part of an infected T helper cell\u2019s DNA. This makes it very difficult for the immune system to find and kill the virus. Because of HIV\u2019s ability to quickly hide within your cells and because it mutates very often, developing a vaccine to prevent HIV is very challenging.\nThe first stage of HIV infection is called acute HIV. This is when someone is first infected with HIV and may experience mild flu-like symptoms or no symptoms at all. This can then progress to chronic infection where HIV will continue to replicate inside T helper cells, slowly killing them and infecting more cells. At this stage, it\u2019s likely that the infected person won\u2019t experience any noticeable symptoms. During this time, they can still transmit HIV, even if they don\u2019t realize they have it.\nHIV infection can affect anyone. To learn more or be tested for the virus, talk to a doctor or visit a local health clinic.\nThe final stage of HIV infection is acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). This is when the number of T helper cells becomes very low. This happens years after initial infection and the immune system has been severely weakened by the virus. The T helper cells that HIV infects and destroys are crucial for activating other immune cells to coordinate an immune response. As the number of T helper cells decreases, the immune system becomes weaker, unable to fight off simple infections or prevent the development of cancer.\nA person with AIDS is more likely to get opportunistic infections, which are infections a healthy immune system could normally prevent. They are also more likely to develop certain types of cancer. These infections and cancers are called AIDS-defining illnesses. They occur because the T helper cells that are supposed to help initiate immune responses are too weak to respond. Some examples include Kaposi sarcoma, tuberculosis, or chronic herpes ulcers.\nHIV treatment and prevention have come a long way, but there is no cure. Today, HIV treatment can prevent HIV infection from progressing to AIDS. When taking HIV treatment as prescribed, many people live long lives. Treatment can even reduce HIV to undetectable levels in person, meaning there is so little virus active in your blood that a test cannot detect it. This doesn\u2019t mean you are cured, but it does mean your treatment is working very effectively. Researchers have even determined that when HIV levels are undetectable and stay undetectable, the virus cannot be transmitted. Immunology research over the last 40 years contributed to these major advancements in HIV treatment that allow people to live decades with little to no symptoms of HIV infection.\nImmunology research is continuing to advance HIV treatments and even help find a cure for the infection. Immunotherapy, treatment that enhances the immune system\u2019s ability to fight disease, is providing promise for people with HIV. A study in 2022, found that a cancer immunotherapy, pembrolizumab, can reverse HIV\u2019s ability to hide in immune cells. The virus\u2019s ability to hide is a major barrier to curing HIV, and immunotherapies like this may be a key step in reaching a cure.\nmRNA vaccines are also showing incredible promise in curing HIV.

Diagnosis and staging were based on the 2014 US surveillance case definition for HIV infection. We divided early HIV-1 infection (stage 0) into two subcategories. Subcategory 0\u03b1: a negative or indeterminate HIV-1 antibody test was \u226460 days after the first confirmed positive HIV-1 test or a negative or indeterminate antibody test or qualitative HIV-1 nucleic acid test (NAT) was \u2264180 days before the first positive test, the latter being a NAT or detectable viral load. Subcategory 0\u03b2: a negative or indeterminate antibody or qualitative NAT was \u2264180 days before the first positive test, the latter being an HIV antibody or antigen/antibody test. We compared median earliest viral loads for each stage and subcategory in each of the first 6 weeks after diagnosis using only the earliest viral load for each individual.\nOf 203,392 infections, 56.69% (115,297/203,392) were reported with a quantified earliest viral load within 6 weeks after diagnosis and criteria sufficient to determine the stage at diagnosis. Among 5081 infections at stage 0, the median earliest viral load fell from 694,000 copies/mL in week 1 to 125,022 in week 2 and 43,473 by week 6. Among 30,910 infections in stage 1, the median earliest viral load ranged 15,412-17,495. Among 42,784 infections in stage 2, the median viral load declined from 44,973 in week 1 to 38,497 in week 6. Among 36,522 infections in stage 3 (AIDS), the median viral load dropped from 205,862 in week 1 to 119,000 in week 6. The median earliest viral load in stage 0 subcategory 0\u03b1 fell from 1,344,590 copies/mL in week 1 to 362,467 in week 2 and 47,320 in week 6, while that in subcategory 0\u03b2 was 70,114 copies/mL in week 1 and then 32,033 to 44,067 in weeks 2-6. The median viral load in subcategory 0\u03b1 was higher than that in subcategory 0\u03b2 in each of the first 6 weeks after diagnosis (P<.001).\nIn the 1st week after diagnosis, viral loads in early infections are generally several times higher than those in later stages at diagnosis. By the 3rd week, however, most are lower than those in stage 3. High viral loads in early infection are much more common in subcategory 0\u03b1 than in subcategory 0\u03b2, consistent with 0\u03b1 comprising mostly acute infections and 0\u03b2 comprising mostly postacute early infections. These findings may inform the prioritization of interventions for prevention.\nKeywords: acute HIV infection, early HIV infection, primary HIV infection, HIV testing, viral load\nThe 2014 revision of the US surveillance case definition for HIV infection added \u201cstage 0\u201d to its staging system to represent early infection (assumed to last about 6 months after the start of infection). HIV infections are classified in stage 0 if they have evidence of being early\u2014negative or indeterminate HIV test results near the time of diagnosis. Otherwise, they are classified in the later stages\u20141, 2, or 3 (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]) [1]. Prompt recognition of infections in stage 0 can provide a critical opportunity to prevent transmission of HIV infection during acute (or primary) infection (part of stage 0). Acute infection is often associated with very high viral loads [2-7], which increase the risk of transmission [8]. Intervention would include antiretroviral treatment to suppress the viral load and the provision of \u201cpartner services,\u201d in which public health workers interview the patient to identify sex or needle-sharing partners in the past 12 months; locate the partners; and offer them HIV testing, counseling, and linkage to care, as appropriate [9,10]. If infected, such partners may also have early infection.\nThis analysis was intended to document the high viral loads that justify giving priority to stage 0 infections for intervention to prevent transmission. For that purpose, we compared median earliest viral loads by week in the first 6 weeks after diagnosis for each stage (0, 1, 2, or 3). Another objective was to demonstrate how HIV surveillance data could be used to distinguish between acute infections and other early HIV infections in stage 0, as the highest priority for intervention should be given to acute infections (expected to have the highest viral loads) rather than given equally to postacute early infections (with lower viral loads). To do that, we defined subcategories of stage 0 that approximate acute infection and postacute early infection and compared median viral loads among these two subcategories.\nWe used data for the 203,392 HIV infections diagnosed during 2012-2016 and reported to the National HIV Surveillance System (NHSS) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention through December 2017 from the 50 US states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands. In the software of the NHSS database, the stage at diagnosis can be automatically classified as stage 0 only for HIV infections diagnosed in or after 2014, when the definition of stage 0 was published [1]. For this analysis, however, we retroactively extended the application of the definition of stage 0 to infections diagnosed in 2012 and 2013 to increase the number of stage 0 diagnoses available for analysis.\nWe excluded the 24.03% (48,880/203,392) of infections for which the stage at diagnosis could not be determined. Their reported data did not include the negative or indeterminate HIV test results required to meet the criteria for stage 0 nor a CD4 T-lymphocyte test result or opportunistic illness diagnosis required to meet the criteria for stage 1, 2, or 3 within 3 months after diagnosis.\nWe assumed that specimens for earliest viral loads would general\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The tissue distribution of potential therapeutics ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nHIV is a virus that hijacks the immune system's white blood cells and forces them to make new copies of the virus. Treatment with antiretroviral drugs is remarkably effective at suppressing replication of the virus, and most individuals who take antiretroviral drugs are able to reduce the amount of HIV circulating in their bloodstream to undetectable levels. However, this treatment cannot eliminate a small but stubborn population of infected white blood cells that contain a copy of the virus's genetic material within their own genomes. These cells can persist in the body for life, and they allow the virus to re-emerge and ignite new rounds of infection if antiretroviral therapy (or ART) is ever interrupted. Eliminating these cells is the focus of an emerging global effort aimed at finding a cure for HIV disease.\nIn order to eradicate these cells, we first need to be able to measure them accurately. Most people on long-term ART have about 10\u20131000 copies of HIV DNA per million white blood cells that can be infected by the virus (Eriksson et al., 2013). However, most of this \u2018total HIV DNA\u2019 is defective and cannot trigger new infections (See Figure 1A). The rare cells that appear to contain intact copies of the virus, which are able to replicate, are referred to as the \u2018latent reservoir\u2019. Moreover, only a fraction of the cells in the latent reservoir can be induced to produce new viruses in cell culture experiments (Ho et al., 2013). Developing a high-throughput method for measuring the size of the latent reservoir will therefore require us to identify a specific molecule (or biomarker) that distinguishes the cells in the reservoir from other infected cells. In the absence of such a method, the only way to currently determine if an intervention has effectively cured a patient, and reduced or eliminated the reservoir, is to interrupt therapy under the supervision of a physician and wait until the virus re-emerges or \u2018rebounds\u2019 (Figure 1B). This approach clearly carries some risk to the patient (and his or her sexual partners) and is logistically challenging.\nIdentifying a biomarker for the latent reservoir of HIV could be used to guide future clinical trials. (A) Much of the HIV DNA harboured by infected cells is defective and cannot replicate itself, \u2026 see more\nNow, in eLife, John Frater at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford and co-workers in the SPARTAC collaboration report an important advance in the search for a biomarker for the latent reservoir. The SPARTAC study enrolled a cohort of individuals infected with HIV who were identified during the early stages of their infection. Subjects were randomly selected to receive either antiretroviral therapy for several weeks before the therapy was stopped, or no antiretroviral therapy (which is the standard course of action for an early HIV infection). This study aimed to determine if short-term ART during an early infection preserves the function of the immune system and eventually allows individuals to stop therapy safely. As previously reported (Fidler et al., 2013), the SPARTAC group found that this was not the case, and concluded that once ART is initiated it should not be interrupted.\nA cure\u2014or more accurately remission (a temporary end of disease symptoms)\u2014will likely be defined based on how long a person remains free from replicating HIV in the absence of therapy. It is logical to predict that the smaller the HIV reservoir during ART, the longer it will take for the virus to rebound after the treatment is stopped (Hill et al., 2014): this idea is also supported by recent clinical experience (Yukl et al., 2013; Henrich et al., 2014; Persaud et al., 2013). A test that is inexpensive, sensitive and reproducible, and that accurately reflects the total amount of replication-competent HIV, would therefore have profound effects on cure research\u2014particularly if it could predict what would happen if therapy were interrupted. Finding a biomarker that achieves all of this would allow investigators to perform efficient proof-of-concept studies and allow regulators to guide companies through the drug development process. Such a development would be comparable to the tremendous advances in antiviral therapies that were enabled by developing the HIV plasma viral load test, which measures how much virus is circulating in the bloodstream.\nOne way to estimate the size of the HIV latent reservoir would be to measure how many cells contain HIV DNA. In the SPARTAC study, Frater and co-workers\u2014who include James Williams and Jacob Hurst as joint first authors\u2014measured the frequency of certain white blood cells (the CD4+ T cells) that harbour HIV DNA (that is, the \u2018total HIV DNA\u2019) in all the participants at the start of the trial. Even though it is well recognised that most HIV DNA is defective and unable to support replication, the total DNA in early untreated HIV infection could predict how the disease would progress (Williams et al., 2014). The total DNA declined by several fold during the course of ART, as expected. The total DNA prior to stopping ART also predicted how quickly the number of CD4+ T cells would decline and how quickly the virus would rebound. Those patients with high levels of total DNA had over double the rate of viral rebound as individuals with low levels of total DNA. Total HIV DNA levels can thus predict how long a patient can safely remain off treatment, and may prove to be useful in monitoring potential cure treatments (Figure 1C). Studies to confirm these observations are now being planned.\nDeveloping and evaluating possible HIV cures faces many challenges beyond how best to measure the reservoir. Nevertheless, there are now many interventions that might provide a cure, including early ART (Persaud et al., 2013; Saez-Cirion et al., 2013) and drugs that essentially shock the virus out of hiding (Archin et al., 2012). Other possible cures include gene therapies (Tebas et al., 2014), stem cell transplantation (Hutter et al., 2009; He\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Reverse transcription is an essential step in retroviral replication. This article presents an overview of reverse transcription, briefly describes the structure and function of RT, provides an introduction to some of the cellular and viral factors that can affect reverse transcription, and discusses fidelity and recombination, two processes in which reverse transcription plays an important role. In keeping with the theme of the collection, the emphasis is on HIV-1 and HIV-1 RT.\nMore than half of the drugs currently approved to treat HIV-1 infections are reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Therefore, the continued characterization of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and the process of reverse transcription is vital.\nIt has been 40 years since the discovery of reverse transcriptase (RT) was announced by Howard Temin and David Baltimore, who independently showed that retroviral virions contain an enzymatic activity that can copy RNA into DNA (Baltimore 1970; Mizutani et al. 1970). These experiments provided the crucial proof of Temin\u2019s provirus hypothesis that retroviral infections persist because the RNA genome found in the virions is converted into DNA (Temin 1964). The sequences of the genomes of eukaryotes show how pervasive reverse transcription is in nature; not only do these genomes contain large numbers of endogenous retroviruses, but also a variety of retroposons and reverse-transcribed elements. The discovery in the early 1980s, that AIDS is caused by a human retrovirus, HIV-1, invigorated retroviral research and focused attention on the viral enzymes, which have become the primary target of anti-AIDS drugs. Not surprisingly, the focus of RT research shifted from the RTs of the murine leukemia viruses (MLV) and the avian myeloblastosis virus to HIV-1 RT. The first approved anti-HIV drug, AZT, targets RT, and of the 26 drugs currently approved to treat HIV-1 infections, 14 are RT inhibitors. In addition, RTs (primarily recombinant MLV RTs) have become extremely valuable tools that are widely used in research, in clinical/diagnostic tests, and in biotechnology. We provide here a relatively brief description of the process of reverse transcription, the structure and biochemical functions of RT, some information about how other viral and cellular factors influence reverse transcription, and briefly consider how the reverse transcription process affects both the mutations that arise during the retroviral life cycle and recombination. The focus will be HIV-1 and HIV-1 RT; however, in some cases, we will draw on insights and include information obtained with other retroviruses and other RTs. Although the issues of the inhibition of HIV-1 RT by anti-RT drugs and the mechanisms of drug resistance are of considerable importance, these issues will not be addressed in detail here; the reader is directed to Arts and Hazuda (2011). Given that the literature on RT and reverse transcription is both vast and complex, and the space allowed for this article is limited, we have had to make some difficult choices in what to present, and what to omit, both in terms of the material and the references. For the omissions, we apologize.\nWhen a mature HIV-1 virion infects a susceptible target cell, interactions of the envelope glycoprotein with the coreceptors on the surface of the cell brings about a fusion of the membranes of the host cell and the virion (Wilen et al. 2011). This fusion introduces the contents of the virion into the cytoplasm of the cell, setting the stage for reverse transcription. There are complexities to the early events that accompany reverse transcription in an infected cell, not all of which are well understood, which will be considered later in this article. We will begin by discussing the mechanics of the conversion of the single-stranded RNA genome found in the virion into the linear double-stranded DNA that is the substrate for the integration process. The synthesis of this linear DNA is a reasonably well-understood process; additional details and references can be found in the books Retroviruses (Telesnitsky and Goff 1997) and Reverse Transcriptase (Skalka and Goff 1993). In orthoretroviruses, including HIV-1, reverse transcription takes place in newly infected cells. There is some debate in the literature about whether reverse transcription is initiated in producer cells. Primer tagging experiments suggest that most HIV-1 virions initiate reverse transcription in newly infected cells (Whitcomb et al. 1990); however, there are claims that a small number of nucleotides may be incorporated before the virions initiate infection of target cells (Lori et al. 1992; Trono 1992; Zhu and Cunningham 1993; Huang et al. 1997). Either way, the vast majority of the viral DNA is synthesized in newly infected cells. This is a lifestyle choice; spumaretroviruses and the more distantly related hepadna viruses carry out extensive reverse transcription in producer cells (Summers and Mason 1982; Yu et al. 1996, 1999). Although there are viral and cellular factors that assist in the process of reverse transcription (these will be discussed later) the two enzymatic activities that are necessary and sufficient to carry out reverse transcription are present in RT. These are a DNA polymerase that can copy either a RNA or a DNA template, and an RNase H that degrades RNA if, and only if, it is part of an RNA\u2013DNA duplex.\nLike many other DNA polymerases, RT needs both a primer and a template.

People with AIDS have very low counts of certain white blood cells and severely damaged immune ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nLearn about Human Immunodeficiency Virus and how it causes Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the cause of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV infects and destroys immune cells called CD4 T cells or T helper cells. Overtime the number of your immune cells will decrease as they are killed by the virus, which leads to AIDS. AIDS is when your immune system is significantly weakened by the virus, and you start to experience complications of a weakened immune system. Today, HIV treatment is highly effective at preventing HIV infection from progressing to AIDS and allowing people living with HIV to lead long lives.\nGlobally: In 2024, 40.8 million people worldwide were living with HIV and 1.3 million new people became infected with the virus.\nUS incidence: In 2024, 1.2 million people in the US were living with HIV and 31,800 new people became infected with the virus.\nSince the beginning of the HIV epidemic in 1981, 91.4 million people have been infected with the virus and 44.1 million have died from HIV-related causes.\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus that infects and destroys immune cells. HIV spreads through contact with bodily fluids including blood, semen, vaginal fluids, and breastmilk. This means HIV can spread through activities such as unprotected sex, sharing needles or syringes, or from mother to baby.\nOnce HIV enters the body, it infects T helper cells (also known as CD4 T cells). When HIV enters a T helper cell, it permanently inserts its viral DNA into the cell\u2019s DNA. The virus has now hijacked the T helper cell, using it to make more copies of the virus. The viral DNA from HIV also becomes permanently part of an infected T helper cell\u2019s DNA. This makes it very difficult for the immune system to find and kill the virus. Because of HIV\u2019s ability to quickly hide within your cells and because it mutates very often, developing a vaccine to prevent HIV is very challenging.\nThe first stage of HIV infection is called acute HIV. This is when someone is first infected with HIV and may experience mild flu-like symptoms or no symptoms at all. This can then progress to chronic infection where HIV will continue to replicate inside T helper cells, slowly killing them and infecting more cells. At this stage, it\u2019s likely that the infected person won\u2019t experience any noticeable symptoms. During this time, they can still transmit HIV, even if they don\u2019t realize they have it.\nHIV infection can affect anyone. To learn more or be tested for the virus, talk to a doctor or visit a local health clinic.\nThe final stage of HIV infection is acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). This is when the number of T helper cells becomes very low. This happens years after initial infection and the immune system has been severely weakened by the virus. The T helper cells that HIV infects and destroys are crucial for activating other immune cells to coordinate an immune response. As the number of T helper cells decreases, the immune system becomes weaker, unable to fight off simple infections or prevent the development of cancer.\nA person with AIDS is more likely to get opportunistic infections, which are infections a healthy immune system could normally prevent. They are also more likely to develop certain types of cancer. These infections and cancers are called AIDS-defining illnesses. They occur because the T helper cells that are supposed to help initiate immune responses are too weak to respond. Some examples include Kaposi sarcoma, tuberculosis, or chronic herpes ulcers.\nHIV treatment and prevention have come a long way, but there is no cure. Today, HIV treatment can prevent HIV infection from progressing to AIDS. When taking HIV treatment as prescribed, many people live long lives. Treatment can even reduce HIV to undetectable levels in person, meaning there is so little virus active in your blood that a test cannot detect it. This doesn\u2019t mean you are cured, but it does mean your treatment is working very effectively. Researchers have even determined that when HIV levels are undetectable and stay undetectable, the virus cannot be transmitted. Immunology research over the last 40 years contributed to these major advancements in HIV treatment that allow people to live decades with little to no symptoms of HIV infection.\nImmunology research is continuing to advance HIV treatments and even help find a cure for the infection. Immunotherapy, treatment that enhances the immune system\u2019s ability to fight disease, is providing promise for people with HIV. A study in 2022, found that a cancer immunotherapy, pembrolizumab, can reverse HIV\u2019s ability to hide in immune cells. The virus\u2019s ability to hide is a major barrier to curing HIV, and immunotherapies like this may be a key step in reaching a cure.\nmRNA vaccines are also showing incredible promise in curing HIV. One study found that mRNA can be delivered to the cells where HIV is hiding and provide instructions to the cell that reveal the virus. Being able to reveal the virus and prevent it from hiding can lead to drugs that permanently eliminate HIV from the body. Another study using mRNA vaccines, successfully trained the immune system to recognize and fight HIV, a major battle in developing successful HIV vaccines. With continued advances in immunology and personalized medicine, researchers hope new technology like mRNA vaccines and immunotherpay will finally lead to a cure for HIV.\nThe American Association of Immunologists (\u201cAAI\u201d) websites (www.aai.org, www.immunologyexplained.org, and all related webpages, the \u201cWebsites\u201d) include information meant to inform visitors (\u201cUsers\u201d) about immunology and its related disciplines.

Prolonged exposure to untreated HIV can eventually cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\nThere is no cure for HIV, but there is good news. Treatment with HIV medicines (called antiretroviral therapy or ART) can slow or prevent HIV from progressing into more serious forms. HIV medicines help people with HIV live long, healthy lives.\nResearch shows that people who start HIV treatment early can live as long as people who do not have the virus, largely due to the advancement of HIV medicines.\nThe progression of HIV occurs in three stages over time (months and years) in people who don\u2019t receive treatment. The stages of HIV infection include:\nAcute HIV infection is the earliest stage of HIV infection, and it generally develops within 2 to 4 weeks after infection with HIV. During this time, some people have flu-like symptoms, such as fever, headache, and rash. In the acute stage of infection, HIV multiplies rapidly and spreads throughout the body, attacking and destroying the infection-fighting CD4 cells (CD4 T lymphocytes) of the immune system. During this stage, the level of HIV in the blood is very high, which greatly increases the risk of HIV transmission.\nThe second stage of HIV infection is chronic HIV infection (also called asymptomatic HIV infection or clinical latency). During this stage, HIV continues to multiply in the body but at very low levels. People with chronic HIV infection may not have any HIV-related symptoms. Without ART, chronic HIV infection usually advances to AIDS in 10 years or longer, though in some people it may advance faster. People who are taking ART may be in this stage for several decades.\nAIDS is the final, most severe stage of HIV infection, and causes severe damage to the immune system. As a result, the body cannot fight off opportunistic infections, also called AIDS-defining conditions. People with HIV are diagnosed with AIDS if they have a CD4 count of less than 200 cells/mm3 or if they have certain opportunistic infections. Once HIV progresses to the AIDS stage, a person can have a high viral load and transmit HIV to others very easily. Without treatment, people with AIDS typically survive about 3 years.\nThe image above depicts what happens in the blood of people with HIV throughout the stages of HIV infection. Without treatment, HIV slowly increases in number and attacks and destroys normal CD4 cells. A lack of CD4 cells severely limits the immune system\u2019s ability to fight off other infections.\nART is very effective at reducing viral load to undetectable levels, particularly when started as early as possible during acute infection. Research trials found that there was a 53% reduction in the risk of death or serious illness if treatment was started with a high CD4 cell count.\nPeople with chronic HIV infection may still transmit HIV to others; however, people who take ART exactly as prescribed and maintain an undetectable viral load during this stage have minimal risk of transmitting HIV to someone without HIV through sex.\nEven if someone\u2019s HIV progresses to AIDS, HIV medicines can still reduce the amount of HIV virus in the blood to undetectable levels, allowing more CD4 cells to regenerate. In turn, people taking these medicines will be less likely to acquire an opportunistic infection, despite an AIDS diagnosis.\nUltimately, virtually anyone with HIV can benefit from modern HIV medicines, regardless of what stage of HIV they are in.\nOnce a person is diagnosed with HIV, they should start ART as soon as possible. One of the main goals of ART is to reduce a person's viral load to an undetectable level. People with HIV who maintain an undetectable viral load have effectively no risk of transmitting HIV to someone without HIV during sex and should maintain relatively normal immune function.\nIn addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that having an undetectable viral load likely reduces the risk of HIV transmission through sharing of needles, syringes, or other drug injection equipment (such as cookers), but are unsure how much the risk is reduced.\nImportantly, ART is only highly effective if taken exactly as prescribed. To ensure that HIV does not progress to more advanced stages, it is important to adhere to your prescribed medication schedule. In some cases, those who do not adhere to an ART schedule can develop resistance to their HIV medicines, making them ineffective.\nSome people face challenges that make it hard to stick to a treatment plan and maintain an undetectable viral load. In this case, they should encourage their partners to take pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). PrEP is medicine that people without HIV can take to prevent HIV infection, even if they get exposed to the virus.\nThis fact sheet is based on information from the following sources:\nFrom HIV.gov:\nFrom the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):\nAlso see the HIV Source collection of HIV links and resources.\nProvided in collaboration with NIH\u2019s Office of AIDS Research.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

HIV infects and destroys immune cells called CD4 T cells or T helper cells. Overtime the number of your immune cells will decrease as they are killed by the virus, which leads to AIDS. AIDS is when your immune system is significantly weakened by the virus, and you start to experience complications of a weakened immune system. Today, HIV treatment is highly effective at preventing HIV infection from progressing to AIDS and allowing people living with HIV to lead long lives.\nGlobally: In 2024, 40.8 million people worldwide were living with HIV and 1.3 million new people became infected with the virus.\nUS incidence: In 2024, 1.2 million people in the US were living with HIV and 31,800 new people became infected with the virus.\nSince the beginning of the HIV epidemic in 1981, 91.4 million people have been infected with the virus and 44.1 million have died from HIV-related causes.\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus that infects and destroys immune cells. HIV spreads through contact with bodily fluids including blood, semen, vaginal fluids, and breastmilk. This means HIV can spread through activities such as unprotected sex, sharing needles or syringes, or from mother to baby.\nOnce HIV enters the body, it infects T helper cells (also known as CD4 T cells). When HIV enters a T helper cell, it permanently inserts its viral DNA into the cell\u2019s DNA. The virus has now hijacked the T helper cell, using it to make more copies of the virus. The viral DNA from HIV also becomes permanently part of an infected T helper cell\u2019s DNA. This makes it very difficult for the immune system to find and kill the virus. Because of HIV\u2019s ability to quickly hide within your cells and because it mutates very often, developing a vaccine to prevent HIV is very challenging.\nThe first stage of HIV infection is called acute HIV. This is when someone is first infected with HIV and may experience mild flu-like symptoms or no symptoms at all. This can then progress to chronic infection where HIV will continue to replicate inside T helper cells, slowly killing them and infecting more cells. At this stage, it\u2019s likely that the infected person won\u2019t experience any noticeable symptoms. During this time, they can still transmit HIV, even if they don\u2019t realize they have it.\nHIV infection can affect anyone. To learn more or be tested for the virus, talk to a doctor or visit a local health clinic.\nThe final stage of HIV infection is acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). This is when the number of T helper cells becomes very low. This happens years after initial infection and the immune system has been severely weakened by the virus. The T helper cells that HIV infects and destroys are crucial for activating other immune cells to coordinate an immune response. As the number of T helper cells decreases, the immune system becomes weaker, unable to fight off simple infections or prevent the development of cancer.\nA person with AIDS is more likely to get opportunistic infections, which are infections a healthy immune system could normally prevent. They are also more likely to develop certain types of cancer. These infections and cancers are called AIDS-defining illnesses. They occur because the T helper cells that are supposed to help initiate immune responses are too weak to respond. Some examples include Kaposi sarcoma, tuberculosis, or chronic herpes ulcers.\nHIV treatment and prevention have come a long way, but there is no cure. Today, HIV treatment can prevent HIV infection from progressing to AIDS. When taking HIV treatment as prescribed, many people live long lives. Treatment can even reduce HIV to undetectable levels in person, meaning there is so little virus active in your blood that a test cannot detect it. This doesn\u2019t mean you are cured, but it does mean your treatment is working very effectively. Researchers have even determined that when HIV levels are undetectable and stay undetectable, the virus cannot be transmitted. Immunology research over the last 40 years contributed to these major advancements in HIV treatment that allow people to live decades with little to no symptoms of HIV infection.\nImmunology research is continuing to advance HIV treatments and even help find a cure for the infection. Immunotherapy, treatment that enhances the immune system\u2019s ability to fight disease, is providing promise for people with HIV. A study in 2022, found that a cancer immunotherapy, pembrolizumab, can reverse HIV\u2019s ability to hide in immune cells. The virus\u2019s ability to hide is a major barrier to curing HIV, and immunotherapies like this may be a key step in reaching a cure.\nmRNA vaccines are also showing incredible promise in curing HIV. One study found that mRNA can be delivered to the cells where HIV is hiding and provide instructions to the cell that reveal the virus. Being able to reveal the virus and prevent it from hiding can lead to drugs that permanently eliminate HIV from the body. Another study using mRNA vaccines, successfully trained the immune system to recognize and fight HIV, a major battle in developing successful HIV vaccines. With continued advances in immunology and personalized medicine, researchers hope new technology like mRNA vaccines and immunotherpay will finally lead to a cure for HIV.\nThe American Association of Immunologists (\u201cAAI\u201d) websites (www.aai.org, www.immunologyexplained.org, and all related webpages, the \u201cWebsites\u201d) include information meant to inform visitors (\u201cUsers\u201d) about immunology and its related disciplines.

Prolonged exposure to untreated HIV can eventually cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\nThere is no cure for HIV, but there is good news. Treatment with HIV medicines (called antiretroviral therapy or ART) can slow or prevent HIV from progressing into more serious forms. HIV medicines help people with HIV live long, healthy lives.\nResearch shows that people who start HIV treatment early can live as long as people who do not have the virus, largely due to the advancement of HIV medicines.\nThe progression of HIV occurs in three stages over time (months and years) in people who don\u2019t receive treatment. The stages of HIV infection include:\nAcute HIV infection is the earliest stage of HIV infection, and it generally develops within 2 to 4 weeks after infection with HIV. During this time, some people have flu-like symptoms, such as fever, headache, and rash. In the acute stage of infection, HIV multiplies rapidly and spreads throughout the body, attacking and destroying the infection-fighting CD4 cells (CD4 T lymphocytes) of the immune system. During this stage, the level of HIV in the blood is very high, which greatly increases the risk of HIV transmission.\nThe second stage of HIV infection is chronic HIV infection (also called asymptomatic HIV infection or clinical latency). During this stage, HIV continues to multiply in the body but at very low levels. People with chronic HIV infection may not have any HIV-related symptoms. Without ART, chronic HIV infection usually advances to AIDS in 10 years or longer, though in some people it may advance faster. People who are taking ART may be in this stage for several decades.\nAIDS is the final, most severe stage of HIV infection, and causes severe damage to the immune system. As a result, the body cannot fight off opportunistic infections, also called AIDS-defining conditions. People with HIV are diagnosed with AIDS if they have a CD4 count of less than 200 cells/mm3 or if they have certain opportunistic infections. Once HIV progresses to the AIDS stage, a person can have a high viral load and transmit HIV to others very easily. Without treatment, people with AIDS typically survive about 3 years.\nThe image above depicts what happens in the blood of people with HIV throughout the stages of HIV infection. Without treatment, HIV slowly increases in number and attacks and destroys normal CD4 cells. A lack of CD4 cells severely limits the immune system\u2019s ability to fight off other infections.\nART is very effective at reducing viral load to undetectable levels, particularly when started as early as possible during acute infection. Research trials found that there was a 53% reduction in the risk of death or serious illness if treatment was started with a high CD4 cell count.\nPeople with chronic HIV infection may still transmit HIV to others; however, people who take ART exactly as prescribed and maintain an undetectable viral load during this stage have minimal risk of transmitting HIV to someone without HIV through sex.\nEven if someone\u2019s HIV progresses to AIDS, HIV medicines can still reduce the amount of HIV virus in the blood to undetectable levels, allowing more CD4 cells to regenerate. In turn, people taking these medicines will be less likely to acquire an opportunistic infection, despite an AIDS diagnosis.\nUltimately, virtually anyone with HIV can benefit from modern HIV medicines, regardless of what stage of HIV they are in.\nOnce a person is diagnosed with HIV, they should start ART as soon as possible. One of the main goals of ART is to reduce a person's viral load to an undetectable level. People with HIV who maintain an undetectable viral load have effectively no risk of transmitting HIV to someone without HIV during sex and should maintain relatively normal immune function.\nIn addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that having an undetectable viral load likely reduces the risk of HIV transmission through sharing of needles, syringes, or other drug injection equipment (such as cookers), but are unsure how much the risk is reduced.\nImportantly, ART is only highly effective if taken exactly as prescribed. To ensure that HIV does not progress to more advanced stages, it is important to adhere to your prescribed medication schedule. In some cases, those who do not adhere to an ART schedule can develop resistance to their HIV medicines, making them ineffective.\nSome people face challenges that make it hard to stick to a treatment plan and maintain an undetectable viral load. In this case, they should encourage their partners to take pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). PrEP is medicine that people without HIV can take to prevent HIV infection, even if they get exposed to the virus.\nThis fact sheet is based on information from the following sources:\nFrom HIV.gov:\nFrom the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):\nAlso see the HIV Source collection of HIV links and resources.\nProvided in collaboration with NIH\u2019s Office of AIDS Research.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

If left untreated, HIV is the virus kills infected cells directly ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nImmune to Cancer: The CRI Blog\nMatthew Tontonoz\nHIV, the virus that causes AIDS, has a talent for spreading between cells of the immune system. Through a process called budding, virus particles are released from an infected cell as little blobs that protrude outward and then pinch off from the cell membrane. Once released from the host cell, the virus particles are free to move to other cells and infect them.\nThis budding process is emblematic of HIV and other viruses that are surrounded by a membrane, or envelope. Each virus particle takes a bit of cell membrane with it when it departs. By slowly denuding the immune cell of its membrane, the virus kills its host cell. When enough immune cells die, the result is immunodeficiency, or AIDS.\nFor many years, it was believed that this budding process represented a new type of cellular behavior induced by the virus\u2014as if (to use a modern analogy) your computer started sending emails without your permission. Now, researchers with NYU School of Medicine propose that HIV is co-opting a normal form of cell behavior\u2014attaching itself to an email you were sending anyway.\nIn an article published in this week\u2019s Nature, CRI postdoctoral fellow Kaushik Choudhuri, DPhil, and colleagues present evidence that HIV uses the same process that certain immune cells, called T cells, use to communicate with other immune cells.\nT cells facilitate an immune response against pathogens\u2014things like viruses or bacteria\u2014and also against cancer. Receptors located on the surface of a T cell are like the cell\u2019s \u201ceyes,\u201d allowing it to see and recognize signs of these dangerous invaders. When a T cell receptor recognizes and binds to a distinctive marker, or antigen, from a pathogen, the T cell becomes activated. Activated T cells kill infected cells directly and also signal other cells of the immune system to act, triggering an immune response.\nT cells only stay active for a brief period of time, at which point they shut down their receptors. (This shutting down is necessary to prevent autoimmunity.) The accepted process by which T cells shut down their signaling is by internalizing the T cell receptors, smuggling them back inside the cell. But new research suggests that something different is going on.\nWhat Choudhuri and colleagues have found is that immune cells also release T cell receptors (TCR) from the cell surface into the space outside the cell. Blobs of cytoplasm and membrane studded with TCRs pinch off from the cell and drift away, much like HIV particles do. They suggest that this budding serves two purposes: 1) it helps shut down an immune response; and 2) it packages up TCRs for delivery to neighboring immune cells awaiting news of invaders.\n\u201cOur discovery that TCR is shed in extracellular microvesicles suggests a radically different fate and function for TCR,\u201d says Choudhuri, who works in the lab of Dr. Michael Dustin at NYU School of Medicine. \u201cFor instance we think that these microvesicles may convey intercellular messages to partner cells.\u201d\nChoudhuri says he and his colleagues were not thinking about HIV when they began their work. Rather, they were more interested in understanding the basic structure and function of the immunological synapse\u2014the region of communication between two adjacent immune cells. It was only when they discovered that the TCR vesicle shedding process relies on the same protein machinery used in HIV budding that they suspected a link. They strengthened their case for a common mechanism by showing that HIV infection antagonizes, or competes with, the making of TCR vesicles.\nIt is a cruel irony that HIV infection appears to spread by co-opting the process by which immune cells communicate with each other. After all, the immune system is designed to protect us from invading pathogens. Communication between immune cells is necessary to keep us safe. HIV devilishly uses that same communication system to spread its deadly message from cell to cell.\nThis process may also suggest why HIV is so difficult to fully eradicate. Researchers have known for a long time that HIV infects CD4+ \u201chelper\u201d T cells, the depletion of which eviscerates the immune system and leaves the patient vulnerable to opportunistic infections. Other immune cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells also become infected but are not killed by the virus. These cells can become \u201creservoirs\u201d of virus hiding out in the body.\n\u201cDespite a lot of progress in treating and controlling HIV infection, it is clear that the virus can persist in reservoirs in the body at low levels even with highly active retroviral therapy,\u201d says Choudhuri. \u201cWe think that our results suggest a way for infected T cells to pass on the virus to these reservoirs\u2014dendritic cells and macrophages, or even other T cells\u2014especially when the infected T cells are interacting with these cells in response to an unrelated infection.\u201d\nChoudhuri\u2019s research is relevant to more than HIV/AIDS. In addition to protecting us from infectious diseases, the immune system also wages a constant battle against cancer. By providing us with basic insights into how the immune system operates, Choudhuri\u2019s work provides cancer immunologists with more tools with which to design better treatments. For example, his team is working on ways to make synthetic forms of these microvesicles that might serve to boost the immune system into fighting tumor cells.\nAnother reason this research is significant is that Choudhuri and his colleagues employed a powerful new approach to viewing cells at the ultramicroscopic level, one that marries cutting-edge light and electron microscopy techniques. \u201cWe anticipate that these techniques will unveil entirely new vistas of the cell biology of T cell activation,\u201d Choudhuri says.\nCRI has a long history of funding such basic immunological research, including research on HIV.

While current ART can manage HIV very well, it does not cure it and people living with HIV must take it for the rest of their lives to suppress viral replication and protect their immune systems. Even when taking ART, people living with HIV have latent HIV reservoirs, which are groups of immune systems cells that carry HIV in a dormant state (i.e., the virus is not able to actively reproduce to create new copies). When people stop taking ART, the virus usually starts multiplying again, rapidly increasing the amount of HIV in a person\u2019s body. As such, analytic treatment interruptions (ATIs; closely monitored treatment pauses) play a crucial role in HIV cure studies as they are currently the only way to know if dormant virus is still hiding in the body. Study A5345 was designed to identify surrogate factors that can predict the timing when HIV may rebound. The hope is that, by identifying these factors, researchers will be able to gauge the effectiveness of treatments without having to interrupt HIV treatment. This approach could accelerate the development of safer and more effective HIV cure strategies.\nIn this study, which was recently published in the journal JCI Insight, participants had been virally suppressed on ART for at least two years; 33 participants began taking ART during chronic HIV infection while 12 began taking it early after acquiring HIV. All participants interrupted ART and were closely monitored for virus in the blood. Participants restarted ART if they had two HIV viral loads of at least 1,000 copies/mL after ATI. As expected, participants who began treatment during early infection had smaller and less active HIV reservoirs, compared with those who began treatment when they had chronic infection.\nOverall, greater HIV specific CD8 T cells response was associated with lower intact proviral DNA. Interestingly, predictors of viral rebound were different across treatment groups. The strongest reservoir predictor of time to HIV rebound was the level of residual viremia in plasma in early-treated participants, while intact DNA level was the strongest predictor in chronic-treated individuals. Researchers also identified distinct sets of pre-ATI viral, immune, and inflammatory markers that differentiated participants who had rapid versus slow rebound; these also differed between treatment groups.\nThese results demonstrate that starting HIV treatment as early as possible resulted in less active virus that was able to reproduce in the HIV reservoir. They provide insights into the complex interplay of viral, immunologic, and inflammatory predictors of viral rebound and demonstrate that the timing of ART initiation modifies the features of rapid and slow viral rebound. This information help guide new studies looking at HIV cure and lowering the amount of active virus in the reservoir.\nJCI Insight. 2024;9(3):e173864.https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.173864.\nADVANCING CLINICAL THERAPEUTICS GLOBALLY\n\u00a9ACTG.

The T helper cells that HIV infects and destroys are crucial for activating other immune cells to coordinate an immune response. As the number of T helper cells decreases, the immune system becomes weaker, unable to fight off simple infections or prevent the development of cancer.\nA person with AIDS is more likely to get opportunistic infections, which are infections a healthy immune system could normally prevent. They are also more likely to develop certain types of cancer. These infections and cancers are called AIDS-defining illnesses. They occur because the T helper cells that are supposed to help initiate immune responses are too weak to respond. Some examples include Kaposi sarcoma, tuberculosis, or chronic herpes ulcers.\nHIV treatment and prevention have come a long way, but there is no cure. Today, HIV treatment can prevent HIV infection from progressing to AIDS. When taking HIV treatment as prescribed, many people live long lives. Treatment can even reduce HIV to undetectable levels in person, meaning there is so little virus active in your blood that a test cannot detect it. This doesn\u2019t mean you are cured, but it does mean your treatment is working very effectively. Researchers have even determined that when HIV levels are undetectable and stay undetectable, the virus cannot be transmitted. Immunology research over the last 40 years contributed to these major advancements in HIV treatment that allow people to live decades with little to no symptoms of HIV infection.\nImmunology research is continuing to advance HIV treatments and even help find a cure for the infection. Immunotherapy, treatment that enhances the immune system\u2019s ability to fight disease, is providing promise for people with HIV. A study in 2022, found that a cancer immunotherapy, pembrolizumab, can reverse HIV\u2019s ability to hide in immune cells. The virus\u2019s ability to hide is a major barrier to curing HIV, and immunotherapies like this may be a key step in reaching a cure.\nmRNA vaccines are also showing incredible promise in curing HIV. One study found that mRNA can be delivered to the cells where HIV is hiding and provide instructions to the cell that reveal the virus. Being able to reveal the virus and prevent it from hiding can lead to drugs that permanently eliminate HIV from the body. Another study using mRNA vaccines, successfully trained the immune system to recognize and fight HIV, a major battle in developing successful HIV vaccines. With continued advances in immunology and personalized medicine, researchers hope new technology like mRNA vaccines and immunotherpay will finally lead to a cure for HIV.\nThe American Association of Immunologists (\u201cAAI\u201d) websites (www.aai.org, www.immunologyexplained.org, and all related webpages, the \u201cWebsites\u201d) include information meant to inform visitors (\u201cUsers\u201d) about immunology and its related disciplines.

Video courtesy of Morgan Huse.\nScientists are coming to appreciate the importance of a specific type of immune cell that keeps people free from disease.\nMost people familiar with the immune system have heard of T cells. These versatile immune cells, which protect us from infections and cancer, have been the focus of immunotherapy \u2014 approaches that use the body\u2019s immune system to fight cancer.\nLesser known, but no less important to healthy immune function, is an immune cell called a natural killer (NK) cell. These specialized fighters destroy damaged or stressed cells, including those infected with viruses and ones showing signs of genetic damage.\nNK cells are experiencing something of a renaissance these days. Scientists are finding they can\u2019t fully understand the body\u2019s response to cancer without taking these cells into account.\nIn 2016, for instance, scientists at the Sloan Kettering Institute discovered that NK cells play a role in metastatic latency. This means that they help keep rogue cancer cells in check and prevent the disease from growing and spreading.\nAnd just last month, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) found that the presence of NK cells in a tumor may help explain why some people respond to certain types of immunotherapy while others do not.\nSo what sets these Quentin Tarantino\u2013esque cells apart from other immune cells?\nAs their name implies, natural killer cells have a special ability to kill their targets without needing to be trained. This contrasts with other immune cells, like T cells, which have to learn how to recognize danger.\nNK cells have two main ways of taking out threats. One is by detecting the presence of stress signals emitted by cells in trouble, including those with genetic damage that might lead to cancer. These stress signals cue NK cells to kill them, in a kind of altruistic self-sacrifice.\n\u201cI tell my students that stressed cells put up \u2018kill me\u2019 flags,\u201d says Joseph Sun, an immunologist in SKI and a professor at the Gerstner Sloan Kettering Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences who studies NK cells.\nThe other way NK cells protect us is by recognizing cells that lack identifiable markers of \u201cself.\u201d Each of our cells has a molecule on it called MHC that differentiates our cells from other people\u2019s cells. NK cells are naturally equipped to kill cells that lack these self-identifying molecules, which in most cases means virally infected cells. Certain viruses have evolved to trick the cells they infect into removing MHC molecules from their surface. This allows the viruses to fly under the radar of T cells, which require MHC for their action.\nLuckily, removing MHC makes the infected cells vulnerable to killing by NK cells.\nCancer cells also sometimes remove their MHC molecules, which means that T cells can\u2019t protect us from these transformed cells, but NK cells can.\nBiology textbooks usually refer to NK cells as part of the innate immune system. This is the system of immune defenses that are present from birth and are always active. Innate immune cells are good at stopping invaders at the gate, but they don\u2019t stick around after a fight, and they don\u2019t learn from past experience.\nThis description doesn\u2019t apply very well to NK cells, it turns out. \u201cNK cells remember, and they can persist in the body for long periods of time,\u201d explains Dr. Sun, whose lab discovered some of these previously unrecognized properties of NK cells. \u201cThis makes them more like the T or B cells of the adaptive immune system.\u201d\nDr. Sun discovered these adaptive qualities of NK cells while he was a postdoctoral fellow in Lewis Lanier\u2019s lab at UCSF. \u201cPeople were very skeptical at first because, for the longest time, the dogma was that NK cells are innate. Anytime you challenge what\u2019s written in a textbook, you\u2019re going to get some backlash from certain folks in the community,\u201d he explains.\nBut over time, he says, more and more evidence in both mice and humans has supported his findings. \u201cI think it\u2019s far more accepted now,\u201d he says.\nIt makes sense: NK cells, T cells, and B cells all develop from the same precursor cell, called a common lymphoid progenitor. They\u2019re basically siblings.\nScientists have begun exploring the use of NK cells in cancer immunotherapy. Some groups have equipped NK cells with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), in the hopes that these cells will prove safer or more effective than CAR T cells, for example.\nAnd NK cells may be playing an unacknowledged role in other types of immunotherapy. Like T cells, NK cells have immune checkpoint molecules, such as CTLA-4 and PD-1. These molecules function like brakes on immune cell activity. They are common targets for the immunotherapy drugs called checkpoint inhibitors. While T cells get most of the credit for the sometimes dramatic responses seen in people receiving these drugs, it could be that NK cells are also contributing to the effect.\n\u201cWhat some T cell biologists probably don\u2019t recognize, or just happily ignore, is that you\u2019re probably unleashing \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

AIDS is when your immune system is significantly weakened by the virus, and you start to experience complications of a weakened immune system. Today, HIV treatment is highly effective at preventing HIV infection from progressing to AIDS and allowing people living with HIV to lead long lives.\nGlobally: In 2024, 40.8 million people worldwide were living with HIV and 1.3 million new people became infected with the virus.\nUS incidence: In 2024, 1.2 million people in the US were living with HIV and 31,800 new people became infected with the virus.\nSince the beginning of the HIV epidemic in 1981, 91.4 million people have been infected with the virus and 44.1 million have died from HIV-related causes.\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus that infects and destroys immune cells. HIV spreads through contact with bodily fluids including blood, semen, vaginal fluids, and breastmilk. This means HIV can spread through activities such as unprotected sex, sharing needles or syringes, or from mother to baby.\nOnce HIV enters the body, it infects T helper cells (also known as CD4 T cells). When HIV enters a T helper cell, it permanently inserts its viral DNA into the cell\u2019s DNA. The virus has now hijacked the T helper cell, using it to make more copies of the virus. The viral DNA from HIV also becomes permanently part of an infected T helper cell\u2019s DNA. This makes it very difficult for the immune system to find and kill the virus. Because of HIV\u2019s ability to quickly hide within your cells and because it mutates very often, developing a vaccine to prevent HIV is very challenging.\nThe first stage of HIV infection is called acute HIV. This is when someone is first infected with HIV and may experience mild flu-like symptoms or no symptoms at all. This can then progress to chronic infection where HIV will continue to replicate inside T helper cells, slowly killing them and infecting more cells. At this stage, it\u2019s likely that the infected person won\u2019t experience any noticeable symptoms.

This activated T-cell response can inflict an overwhelming degree of damage to the targeted cells, which in most instances leads to the control and elimination of foreign invaders. However, in conditions of chronic infection, persistent exposure of T cells to high levels of antigen results in a severe T-cell dysfunctional state called exhaustion. T-cell exhaustion leads to a suboptimal immune-mediated control of multiple viral infections including the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In this review, we will discuss the role of T-cell exhaustion in HIV disease progression, the long-term defect of T-cell function even in aviremic patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART), the role of exhaustion-specific markers in maintaining a reservoir of latently infected cells, and exploiting these markers in HIV cure strategies.\nThe T-cell activation paradigm proceeds in a highly organized process involving three signals consisting of antigen recognition, receptor costimulation, and a termination signal that are required for the tight regulation of a strong functional and proliferative response.\nSignal one in T-cell activation represents the specific recognition through the T-cell receptor (TCR) of their cognate antigen presented by professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) including dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells.\nSignal two is the costimulatory signal where receptors on the T cells bind to their counterpart ligands. CD28 is the primary costimulatory receptor for T cells that acts through interaction with its ligands, CD80 and CD86 expressed on APCs. Costimulation is essential for T-cell activation since signal one TCR/antigen recognition in the absence of signal two drives the cell toward an anergic and/or tolerogenic state.1 Additional costimulatory receptors that can enhance T-cell activation include CD27, OX40 (CD134), ICOS (CD278), CD40L (CD154), CD226 that bind to CD70, OX40L (CD252), B7-H2 (CD275), CD40, and CD155/CD112, respectively, on APCs.2 The concentration of costimulatory and ligand molecules can vary significantly such that either no positive signal is sent or a paired interaction provides a strong supporting signal two to the T cells. Soluble pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-12 and type I interferons contribute to a fully activated T-cell response.\nSignal three arises in the days following T-cell activation, the effector phase of the immune response, and eventually the elimination of the pathogen. Signal three is responsible for terminating the immune response. Inhibitory receptors, also called immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), exert their influence on T-cell activation at this stage where under normal conditions, ICIs including programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1), cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), LAG3 (lymphocyte activation gene protein), and TIM3 (T-cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain-containing protein 3) are transiently upregulated on the surface of effector T cells within hours to days following T-cell activation. Here, their purpose is to attenuate T-cell activation and limit immune function at the end stages of an acute infection when a pathogen is controlled. Upon clearance of antigen, the expression of these ICIs on memory T cells declines to normal levels over time. Termination of the T-cell response is an essential self-limiting mechanisms to help preserve self-tolerance. However, in the case of chronic infection or cancer when the immune response is incapable of clearing the foreign antigen and there persistent chronic stimulation, T cells can enter a dysfunctional state called exhaustion.\nT-cell exhaustion is a progressive condition with increasing loss in effector function coinciding with increased expression levels and assortment of ICIs. PD-1 is recognized as the master inhibitory regulator of T-cell function but with increased degrees of exhaustion comes elevated levels of additional ICIs including CTLA-4, TIM3, LAG3, T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT), 2B4 (CD244), and CD1603, 4 (Figure 1). T-cell exhaustion mediated through PD-1 relies on interaction with its cognate ligands, PDL-1 and PD-L2, which regulate the delicate balance between immune defense and the protection of healthy tissue. Immune cells, non-immune endothelial, and epithelial cells constitutively express PDL-1, while PDL-2 expression is limited to APCs. The expression of PDL-1 is further upregulated after activation, which modulates the immune responses against self and foreign antigens.5 In a likewise fashion, the interaction of additional ICIs with their respective ligands exert a further level of control and suppression of T-cell function.\nIn exhausted CD8 T cells, the increased expression of ICIs leads to a hierarchical loss of function that begins with reduced IL-2 secretion, cytokine polyfunctionality, and diminished proliferative potential. Functional defects progress to the loss in cytotoxic capacity and TNF-\u03b1 secretion with highly exhausted cells having reduced ability to produce IFN-\u03b3.6-8 Although T-cell exhaustion was first identified in CD8 T cells, it is now accepted that CD4 T cells are also subject to exhaustion leading to reduced production of IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b19-11 along with reduced CD4 T-cell help.12 In addition to persistent antigen and pathogen burden, the loss or reduction of CD4 T-cell help is an important factor that contributes to the initial establishment of exhaustion.13-15 The precise nature of optimal CD4 T-cell help needed to antagonize exhaustion is unclear, but is likely to involve the production of IL-2 and IL-21 cytokines that support CD8 T-cell response both directly and indirectly through activation of APCs.16\nAside from a blunted immune response against infected or cancerous cells, exhausted T cells have a poor or varied response to homeostatic cytokines including IL-7 and IL-15 r\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This is when the number of T helper cells becomes very low. This happens years after initial infection and the immune system has been severely weakened by the virus. The T helper cells that HIV infects and destroys are crucial for activating other immune cells to coordinate an immune response. As the number of T helper cells decreases, the immune system becomes weaker, unable to fight off simple infections or prevent the development of cancer.\nA person with AIDS is more likely to get opportunistic infections, which are infections a healthy immune system could normally prevent. They are also more likely to develop certain types of cancer. These infections and cancers are called AIDS-defining illnesses. They occur because the T helper cells that are supposed to help initiate immune responses are too weak to respond. Some examples include Kaposi sarcoma, tuberculosis, or chronic herpes ulcers.\nHIV treatment and prevention have come a long way, but there is no cure. Today, HIV treatment can prevent HIV infection from progressing to AIDS. When taking HIV treatment as prescribed, many people live long lives. Treatment can even reduce HIV to undetectable levels in person, meaning there is so little virus active in your blood that a test cannot detect it. This doesn\u2019t mean you are cured, but it does mean your treatment is working very effectively. Researchers have even determined that when HIV levels are undetectable and stay undetectable, the virus cannot be transmitted. Immunology research over the last 40 years contributed to these major advancements in HIV treatment that allow people to live decades with little to no symptoms of HIV infection.\nImmunology research is continuing to advance HIV treatments and even help find a cure for the infection. Immunotherapy, treatment that enhances the immune system\u2019s ability to fight disease, is providing promise for people with HIV. A study in 2022, found that a cancer immunotherapy, pembrolizumab, can reverse HIV\u2019s ability to hide in immune cells. The virus\u2019s ability to hide is a major barrier to curing HIV, and immunotherapies like this may be a key step in reaching a cure.\nmRNA vaccines are also showing incredible promise in curing HIV. One study found that mRNA can be delivered to the cells where HIV is hiding and provide instructions to the cell that reveal the virus. Being able to reveal the virus and prevent it from hiding can lead to drugs that permanently eliminate HIV from the body. Another study using mRNA vaccines, successfully trained the immune system to recognize and fight HIV, a major battle in developing successful HIV vaccines. With continued advances in immunology and personalized medicine, researchers hope new technology like mRNA vaccines and immunotherpay will finally lead to a cure for HIV.\nThe American Association of Immunologists (\u201cAAI\u201d) websites (www.aai.org, www.immunologyexplained.org, and all related webpages, the \u201cWebsites\u201d) include information meant to inform visitors (\u201cUsers\u201d) about immunology and its related disciplines.

HIV infects and destroys immune cells called CD4 T cells or T helper cells. Overtime the number of your immune cells will decrease as they are killed by the virus, which leads to AIDS. AIDS is when your immune system is significantly weakened by the virus, and you start to experience complications of a weakened immune system. Today, HIV treatment is highly effective at preventing HIV infection from progressing to AIDS and allowing people living with HIV to lead long lives.\nGlobally: In 2024, 40.8 million people worldwide were living with HIV and 1.3 million new people became infected with the virus.\nUS incidence: In 2024, 1.2 million people in the US were living with HIV and 31,800 new people became infected with the virus.\nSince the beginning of the HIV epidemic in 1981, 91.4 million people have been infected with the virus and 44.1 million have died from HIV-related causes.\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus that infects and destroys immune cells. HIV spreads through contact with bodily fluids including blood, semen, vaginal fluids, and breastmilk. This means HIV can spread through activities such as unprotected sex, sharing needles or syringes, or from mother to baby.\nOnce HIV enters the body, it infects T helper cells (also known as CD4 T cells). When HIV enters a T helper cell, it permanently inserts its viral DNA into the cell\u2019s DNA. The virus has now hijacked the T helper cell, using it to make more copies of the virus. The viral DNA from HIV also becomes permanently part of an infected T helper cell\u2019s DNA. This makes it very difficult for the immune system to find and kill the virus. Because of HIV\u2019s ability to quickly hide within your cells and because it mutates very often, developing a vaccine to prevent HIV is very challenging.\nThe first stage of HIV infection is called acute HIV. This is when someone is first infected with HIV and may experience mild flu-like symptoms or no symptoms at all. This can then progress to chronic infection where HIV will continue to replicate inside T helper cells, slowly killing them and infecting more cells. At this stage, it\u2019s likely that the infected person won\u2019t experience any noticeable symptoms. During this time, they can still transmit HIV, even if they don\u2019t realize they have it.\nHIV infection can affect anyone.

Through a process called budding, virus particles are released from an infected cell as little blobs that protrude outward and then pinch off from the cell membrane. Once released from the host cell, the virus particles are free to move to other cells and infect them.\nThis budding process is emblematic of HIV and other viruses that are surrounded by a membrane, or envelope. Each virus particle takes a bit of cell membrane with it when it departs. By slowly denuding the immune cell of its membrane, the virus kills its host cell. When enough immune cells die, the result is immunodeficiency, or AIDS.\nFor many years, it was believed that this budding process represented a new type of cellular behavior induced by the virus\u2014as if (to use a modern analogy) your computer started sending emails without your permission. Now, researchers with NYU School of Medicine propose that HIV is co-opting a normal form of cell behavior\u2014attaching itself to an email you were sending anyway.\nIn an article published in this week\u2019s Nature, CRI postdoctoral fellow Kaushik Choudhuri, DPhil, and colleagues present evidence that HIV uses the same process that certain immune cells, called T cells, use to communicate with other immune cells.\nT cells facilitate an immune response against pathogens\u2014things like viruses or bacteria\u2014and also against cancer. Receptors located on the surface of a T cell are like the cell\u2019s \u201ceyes,\u201d allowing it to see and recognize signs of these dangerous invaders. When a T cell receptor recognizes and binds to a distinctive marker, or antigen, from a pathogen, the T cell becomes activated. Activated T cells kill infected cells directly and also signal other cells of the immune system to act, triggering an immune response.\nT cells only stay active for a brief period of time, at which point they shut down their receptors. (This shutting down is necessary to prevent autoimmunity.) The accepted process by which T cells shut down their signaling is by internalizing the T cell receptors, smuggling them back inside the cell. But new research suggests that something different is going on.\nWhat Choudhuri and colleagues have found is that immune cells also release T cell receptors (TCR) from the cell surface into the space outside the cell. Blobs of cytoplasm and membrane studded with TCRs pinch off from the cell and drift away, much like HIV particles do. They suggest that this budding serves two purposes: 1) it helps shut down an immune response; and 2) it packages up TCRs for delivery to neighboring immune cells awaiting news of invaders.\n\u201cOur discovery that TCR is shed in extracellular microvesicles suggests a radically different fate and function for TCR,\u201d says Choudhuri, who works in the lab of Dr. Michael Dustin at NYU School of Medicine. \u201cFor instance we think that these microvesicles may convey intercellular messages to partner cells.\u201d\nChoudhuri says he and his colleagues were not thinking about HIV when they began their work. Rather, they were more interested in understanding the basic structure and function of the immunological synapse\u2014the region of communication between two adjacent immune cells. It was only when they discovered that the TCR vesicle shedding process relies on the same protein machinery used in HIV budding that they suspected a link. They strengthened their case for a common mechanism by showing that HIV infection antagonizes, or competes with, the making of TCR vesicles.\nIt is a cruel irony that HIV infection appears to spread by co-opting the process by which immune cells communicate with each other. After all, the immune system is designed to protect us from invading pathogens. Communication between immune cells is necessary to keep us safe. HIV devilishly uses that same communication system to spread its deadly message from cell to cell.\nThis process may also suggest why HIV is so difficult to fully eradicate. Researchers have known for a long time that HIV infects CD4+ \u201chelper\u201d T cells, the depletion of which eviscerates the immune system and leaves the patient vulnerable to opportunistic infections. Other immune cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells also become infected but are not killed by the virus. These cells can become \u201creservoirs\u201d of virus hiding out in the body.\n\u201cDespite a lot of progress in treating and controlling HIV infection, it is clear that the virus can persist in reservoirs in the body at low levels even with highly active retroviral therapy,\u201d says Choudhuri. \u201cWe think that our results suggest a way for infected T cells to pass on the virus to these reservoirs\u2014dendritic cells and macrophages, or even other T cells\u2014especially when the infected T cells are interacting with these cells in response to an unrelated infection.\u201d\nChoudhuri\u2019s research is relevant to more than HIV/AIDS. In addition to protecting us from infectious diseases, the immune system also wages a constant battle against cancer. By providing us with basic insights into how the immune system operates, Choudhuri\u2019s work provides cancer immunologists with more tools with which to design better treatments.

Treatment with antiretroviral drugs is remarkably effective at suppressing replication of the virus, and most individuals who take antiretroviral drugs are able to reduce the amount of HIV circulating in their bloodstream to undetectable levels. However, this treatment cannot eliminate a small but stubborn population of infected white blood cells that contain a copy of the virus's genetic material within their own genomes. These cells can persist in the body for life, and they allow the virus to re-emerge and ignite new rounds of infection if antiretroviral therapy (or ART) is ever interrupted. Eliminating these cells is the focus of an emerging global effort aimed at finding a cure for HIV disease.\nIn order to eradicate these cells, we first need to be able to measure them accurately. Most people on long-term ART have about 10\u20131000 copies of HIV DNA per million white blood cells that can be infected by the virus (Eriksson et al., 2013). However, most of this \u2018total HIV DNA\u2019 is defective and cannot trigger new infections (See Figure 1A). The rare cells that appear to contain intact copies of the virus, which are able to replicate, are referred to as the \u2018latent reservoir\u2019. Moreover, only a fraction of the cells in the latent reservoir can be induced to produce new viruses in cell culture experiments (Ho et al., 2013). Developing a high-throughput method for measuring the size of the latent reservoir will therefore require us to identify a specific molecule (or biomarker) that distinguishes the cells in the reservoir from other infected cells. In the absence of such a method, the only way to currently determine if an intervention has effectively cured a patient, and reduced or eliminated the reservoir, is to interrupt therapy under the supervision of a physician and wait until the virus re-emerges or \u2018rebounds\u2019 (Figure 1B). This approach clearly carries some risk to the patient (and his or her sexual partners) and is logistically challenging.\nIdentifying a biomarker for the latent reservoir of HIV could be used to guide future clinical trials. (A) Much of the HIV DNA harboured by infected cells is defective and cannot replicate itself, \u2026 see more\nNow, in eLife, John Frater at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford and co-workers in the SPARTAC collaboration report an important advance in the search for a biomarker for the latent reservoir. The SPARTAC study enrolled a cohort of individuals infected with HIV who were identified during the early stages of their infection. Subjects were randomly selected to receive either antiretroviral therapy for several weeks before the therapy was stopped, or no antiretroviral therapy (which is the standard course of action for an early HIV infection). This study aimed to determine if short-term ART during an early infection preserves the function of the immune system and eventually allows individuals to stop therapy safely. As previously reported (Fidler et al., 2013), the SPARTAC group found that this was not the case, and concluded that once ART is initiated it should not be interrupted.\nA cure\u2014or more accurately remission (a temporary end of disease symptoms)\u2014will likely be defined based on how long a person remains free from replicating HIV in the absence of therapy. It is logical to predict that the smaller the HIV reservoir during ART, the longer it will take for the virus to rebound after the treatment is stopped (Hill et al., 2014): this idea is also supported by recent clinical experience (Yukl et al., 2013; Henrich et al., 2014; Persaud et al., 2013). A test that is inexpensive, sensitive and reproducible, and that accurately reflects the total amount of replication-competent HIV, would therefore have profound effects on cure research\u2014particularly if it could predict what would happen if therapy were interrupted. Finding a biomarker that achieves all of this would allow investigators to perform efficient proof-of-concept studies and allow regulators to guide companies through the drug development process. Such a development would be comparable to the tremendous advances in antiviral therapies that were enabled by developing the HIV plasma viral load test, which measures how much virus is circulating in the bloodstream.\nOne way to estimate the size of the HIV latent reservoir would be to measure how many cells contain HIV DNA. In the SPARTAC study, Frater and co-workers\u2014who include James Williams and Jacob Hurst as joint first authors\u2014measured the frequency of certain white blood cells (the CD4+ T cells) that harbour HIV DNA (that is, the \u2018total HIV DNA\u2019) in all the participants at the start of the trial. Even though it is well recognised that most HIV DNA is defective and unable to support replication, the total DNA in early untreated HIV infection could predict how the disease would progress (Williams et al., 2014). The total DNA declined by several fold during the course of ART, as expected. The total DNA prior to stopping ART also predicted how quickly the number of CD4+ T cells would decline and how quickly the virus would rebound. Those patients with high levels of total DNA had over double the rate of viral rebound as individuals with low levels of total DNA. Total HIV DNA levels can thus predict how long a patient can safely remain off treatment, and may prove to be useful in monitoring potential cure treatments (Figure 1C). Studies to confirm these observations are now being planned.\nDeveloping and evaluating possible HIV cures faces many challenges beyond how best to measure the reservoir. Nevertheless, there are now many interventions that might provide a cure, including early ART (Persaud et al., 2013; Saez-Cirion et al., 2013) and drugs that essentially shock the virus out of hiding (Archin et al., 2012). Other possible cures include gene therapies (Tebas et al., 2014), stem cell transplantation (Hutter et al., 2009; He\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Video courtesy of Morgan Huse.\nScientists are coming to appreciate the importance of a specific type of immune cell that keeps people free from disease.\nMost people familiar with the immune system have heard of T cells. These versatile immune cells, which protect us from infections and cancer, have been the focus of immunotherapy \u2014 approaches that use the body\u2019s immune system to fight cancer.\nLesser known, but no less important to healthy immune function, is an immune cell called a natural killer (NK) cell. These specialized fighters destroy damaged or stressed cells, including those infected with viruses and ones showing signs of genetic damage.\nNK cells are experiencing something of a renaissance these days. Scientists are finding they can\u2019t fully understand the body\u2019s response to cancer without taking these cells into account.\nIn 2016, for instance, scientists at the Sloan Kettering Institute discovered that NK cells play a role in metastatic latency. This means that they help keep rogue cancer cells in check and prevent the disease from growing and spreading.\nAnd just last month, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) found that the presence of NK cells in a tumor may help explain why some people respond to certain types of immunotherapy while others do not.\nSo what sets these Quentin Tarantino\u2013esque cells apart from other immune cells?\nAs their name implies, natural killer cells have a special ability to kill their targets without needing to be trained. This contrasts with other immune cells, like T cells, which have to learn how to recognize danger.\nNK cells have two main ways of taking out threats. One is by detecting the presence of stress signals emitted by cells in trouble, including those with genetic damage that might lead to cancer. These stress signals cue NK cells to kill them, in a kind of altruistic self-sacrifice.\n\u201cI tell my students that stressed cells put up \u2018kill me\u2019 flags,\u201d says Joseph Sun, an immunologist in SKI and a professor at the Gerstner Sloan Kettering Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences who studies NK cells.\nThe other way NK cells protect us is by recognizing cells that lack identifiable markers of \u201cself.\u201d Each of our cells has a molecule on it called MHC that differentiates our cells from other people\u2019s cells. NK cells are naturally equipped to kill cells that lack these self-identifying molecules, which in most cases means virally infected cells. Certain viruses have evolved to trick the cells they infect into removing MHC molecules from their surface. This allows the viruses to fly under the radar of T cells, which require MHC for their action.\nLuckily, removing MHC makes the infected cells vulnerable to killing by NK cells.\nCancer cells also sometimes remove their MHC molecules, which means that T cells can\u2019t protect us from these transformed cells, but NK cells can.\nBiology textbooks usually refer to NK cells as part of the innate immune system. This is the system of immune defenses that are present from birth and are always active. Innate immune cells are good at stopping invaders at the gate, but they don\u2019t stick around after a fight, and they don\u2019t learn from past experience.\nThis description doesn\u2019t apply very well to NK cells, it turns out. \u201cNK cells remember, and they can persist in the body for long periods of time,\u201d explains Dr. Sun, whose lab discovered some of these previously unrecognized properties of NK cells. \u201cThis makes them more like the T or B cells of the adaptive immune system.\u201d\nDr. Sun discovered these adaptive qualities of NK cells while he was a postdoctoral fellow in Lewis Lanier\u2019s lab at UCSF. \u201cPeople were very skeptical at first because, for the longest time, the dogma was that NK cells are innate. Anytime you challenge what\u2019s written in a textbook, you\u2019re going to get some backlash from certain folks in the community,\u201d he explains.\nBut over time, he says, more and more evidence in both mice and humans has supported his findings. \u201cI think it\u2019s far more accepted now,\u201d he says.\nIt makes sense: NK cells, T cells, and B cells all develop from the same precursor cell, called a common lymphoid progenitor. They\u2019re basically siblings.\nScientists have begun exploring the use of NK cells in cancer immunotherapy. Some groups have equipped NK cells with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), in the hopes that these cells will prove safer or more effective than CAR T cells, for example.\nAnd NK cells may be playing an unacknowledged role in other types of immunotherapy. Like T cells, NK cells have immune checkpoint molecules, such as CTLA-4 and PD-1. These molecules function like brakes on immune cell activity. They are common targets for the immunotherapy drugs called checkpoint inhibitors. While T cells get most of the credit for the sometimes dramatic responses seen in people receiving these drugs, it could be that NK cells are also contributing to the effect.\n\u201cWhat some T cell biologists probably don\u2019t recognize, or just happily ignore, is that you\u2019re probably unleashing \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This is particularly relevant ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nImmune to Cancer: The CRI Blog\nMatthew Tontonoz\nHIV, the virus that causes AIDS, has a talent for spreading between cells of the immune system. Through a process called budding, virus particles are released from an infected cell as little blobs that protrude outward and then pinch off from the cell membrane. Once released from the host cell, the virus particles are free to move to other cells and infect them.\nThis budding process is emblematic of HIV and other viruses that are surrounded by a membrane, or envelope. Each virus particle takes a bit of cell membrane with it when it departs. By slowly denuding the immune cell of its membrane, the virus kills its host cell. When enough immune cells die, the result is immunodeficiency, or AIDS.\nFor many years, it was believed that this budding process represented a new type of cellular behavior induced by the virus\u2014as if (to use a modern analogy) your computer started sending emails without your permission. Now, researchers with NYU School of Medicine propose that HIV is co-opting a normal form of cell behavior\u2014attaching itself to an email you were sending anyway.\nIn an article published in this week\u2019s Nature, CRI postdoctoral fellow Kaushik Choudhuri, DPhil, and colleagues present evidence that HIV uses the same process that certain immune cells, called T cells, use to communicate with other immune cells.\nT cells facilitate an immune response against pathogens\u2014things like viruses or bacteria\u2014and also against cancer. Receptors located on the surface of a T cell are like the cell\u2019s \u201ceyes,\u201d allowing it to see and recognize signs of these dangerous invaders. When a T cell receptor recognizes and binds to a distinctive marker, or antigen, from a pathogen, the T cell becomes activated. Activated T cells kill infected cells directly and also signal other cells of the immune system to act, triggering an immune response.\nT cells only stay active for a brief period of time, at which point they shut down their receptors. (This shutting down is necessary to prevent autoimmunity.) The accepted process by which T cells shut down their signaling is by internalizing the T cell receptors, smuggling them back inside the cell. But new research suggests that something different is going on.\nWhat Choudhuri and colleagues have found is that immune cells also release T cell receptors (TCR) from the cell surface into the space outside the cell. Blobs of cytoplasm and membrane studded with TCRs pinch off from the cell and drift away, much like HIV particles do. They suggest that this budding serves two purposes: 1) it helps shut down an immune response; and 2) it packages up TCRs for delivery to neighboring immune cells awaiting news of invaders.\n\u201cOur discovery that TCR is shed in extracellular microvesicles suggests a radically different fate and function for TCR,\u201d says Choudhuri, who works in the lab of Dr. Michael Dustin at NYU School of Medicine. \u201cFor instance we think that these microvesicles may convey intercellular messages to partner cells.\u201d\nChoudhuri says he and his colleagues were not thinking about HIV when they began their work. Rather, they were more interested in understanding the basic structure and function of the immunological synapse\u2014the region of communication between two adjacent immune cells. It was only when they discovered that the TCR vesicle shedding process relies on the same protein machinery used in HIV budding that they suspected a link. They strengthened their case for a common mechanism by showing that HIV infection antagonizes, or competes with, the making of TCR vesicles.\nIt is a cruel irony that HIV infection appears to spread by co-opting the process by which immune cells communicate with each other. After all, the immune system is designed to protect us from invading pathogens. Communication between immune cells is necessary to keep us safe. HIV devilishly uses that same communication system to spread its deadly message from cell to cell.\nThis process may also suggest why HIV is so difficult to fully eradicate. Researchers have known for a long time that HIV infects CD4+ \u201chelper\u201d T cells, the depletion of which eviscerates the immune system and leaves the patient vulnerable to opportunistic infections. Other immune cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells also become infected but are not killed by the virus. These cells can become \u201creservoirs\u201d of virus hiding out in the body.\n\u201cDespite a lot of progress in treating and controlling HIV infection, it is clear that the virus can persist in reservoirs in the body at low levels even with highly active retroviral therapy,\u201d says Choudhuri. \u201cWe think that our results suggest a way for infected T cells to pass on the virus to these reservoirs\u2014dendritic cells and macrophages, or even other T cells\u2014especially when the infected T cells are interacting with these cells in response to an unrelated infection.\u201d\nChoudhuri\u2019s research is relevant to more than HIV/AIDS. In addition to protecting us from infectious diseases, the immune system also wages a constant battle against cancer. By providing us with basic insights into how the immune system operates, Choudhuri\u2019s work provides cancer immunologists with more tools with which to design better treatments. For example, his team is working on ways to make synthetic forms of these microvesicles that might serve to boost the immune system into fighting tumor cells.\nAnother reason this research is significant is that Choudhuri and his colleagues employed a powerful new approach to viewing cells at the ultramicroscopic level, one that marries cutting-edge light and electron microscopy techniques. \u201cWe anticipate that these techniques will unveil entirely new vistas of the cell biology of T cell activation,\u201d Choudhuri says.\nCRI has a long history of funding such basic immunological research, including research on HIV. In fact, CRI became an early funder of AIDS research in the 1980s when immunodeficient individuals began to develop Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma, a \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Diagnosis and staging were based on the 2014 US surveillance case definition for HIV infection. We divided early HIV-1 infection (stage 0) into two subcategories. Subcategory 0\u03b1: a negative or indeterminate HIV-1 antibody test was \u226460 days after the first confirmed positive HIV-1 test or a negative or indeterminate antibody test or qualitative HIV-1 nucleic acid test (NAT) was \u2264180 days before the first positive test, the latter being a NAT or detectable viral load. Subcategory 0\u03b2: a negative or indeterminate antibody or qualitative NAT was \u2264180 days before the first positive test, the latter being an HIV antibody or antigen/antibody test. We compared median earliest viral loads for each stage and subcategory in each of the first 6 weeks after diagnosis using only the earliest viral load for each individual.\nOf 203,392 infections, 56.69% (115,297/203,392) were reported with a quantified earliest viral load within 6 weeks after diagnosis and criteria sufficient to determine the stage at diagnosis. Among 5081 infections at stage 0, the median earliest viral load fell from 694,000 copies/mL in week 1 to 125,022 in week 2 and 43,473 by week 6. Among 30,910 infections in stage 1, the median earliest viral load ranged 15,412-17,495. Among 42,784 infections in stage 2, the median viral load declined from 44,973 in week 1 to 38,497 in week 6. Among 36,522 infections in stage 3 (AIDS), the median viral load dropped from 205,862 in week 1 to 119,000 in week 6. The median earliest viral load in stage 0 subcategory 0\u03b1 fell from 1,344,590 copies/mL in week 1 to 362,467 in week 2 and 47,320 in week 6, while that in subcategory 0\u03b2 was 70,114 copies/mL in week 1 and then 32,033 to 44,067 in weeks 2-6. The median viral load in subcategory 0\u03b1 was higher than that in subcategory 0\u03b2 in each of the first 6 weeks after diagnosis (P<.001).\nIn the 1st week after diagnosis, viral loads in early infections are generally several times higher than those in later stages at diagnosis. By the 3rd week, however, most are lower than those in stage 3. High viral loads in early infection are much more common in subcategory 0\u03b1 than in subcategory 0\u03b2, consistent with 0\u03b1 comprising mostly acute infections and 0\u03b2 comprising mostly postacute early infections. These findings may inform the prioritization of interventions for prevention.\nKeywords: acute HIV infection, early HIV infection, primary HIV infection, HIV testing, viral load\nThe 2014 revision of the US surveillance case definition for HIV infection added \u201cstage 0\u201d to its staging system to represent early infection (assumed to last about 6 months after the start of infection). HIV infections are classified in stage 0 if they have evidence of being early\u2014negative or indeterminate HIV test results near the time of diagnosis. Otherwise, they are classified in the later stages\u20141, 2, or 3 (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]) [1]. Prompt recognition of infections in stage 0 can provide a critical opportunity to prevent transmission of HIV infection during acute (or primary) infection (part of stage 0). Acute infection is often associated with very high viral loads [2-7], which increase the risk of transmission [8]. Intervention would include antiretroviral treatment to suppress the viral load and the provision of \u201cpartner services,\u201d in which public health workers interview the patient to identify sex or needle-sharing partners in the past 12 months; locate the partners; and offer them HIV testing, counseling, and linkage to care, as appropriate [9,10]. If infected, such partners may also have early infection.\nThis analysis was intended to document the high viral loads that justify giving priority to stage 0 infections for intervention to prevent transmission. For that purpose, we compared median earliest viral loads by week in the first 6 weeks after diagnosis for each stage (0, 1, 2, or 3). Another objective was to demonstrate how HIV surveillance data could be used to distinguish between acute infections and other early HIV infections in stage 0, as the highest priority for intervention should be given to acute infections (expected to have the highest viral loads) rather than given equally to postacute early infections (with lower viral loads). To do that, we defined subcategories of stage 0 that approximate acute infection and postacute early infection and compared median viral loads among these two subcategories.\nWe used data for the 203,392 HIV infections diagnosed during 2012-2016 and reported to the National HIV Surveillance System (NHSS) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention through December 2017 from the 50 US states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands. In the software of the NHSS database, the stage at diagnosis can be automatically classified as stage 0 only for HIV infections diagnosed in or after 2014, when the definition of stage 0 was published [1]. For this analysis, however, we retroactively extended the application of the definition of stage 0 to infections diagnosed in 2012 and 2013 to increase the number of stage 0 diagnoses available for analysis.\nWe excluded the 24.03% (48,880/203,392) of infections for which the stage at diagnosis could not be determined. Their reported data did not include the negative or indeterminate HIV test results required to meet the criteria for stage 0 nor a CD4 T-lymphocyte test result or opportunistic illness diagnosis required to meet the criteria for stage 1, 2, or 3 within 3 months after diagnosis.\nWe assumed that specimens for earliest viral loads would general\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

They saw that six months after this early treatment, the immune system did indeed work as in people without HIV. But in the longer term, the immune system was disrupted again. This is shown by research by Amsterdam UMC, published in the journal eBioMedicine.\nFor this study, the scientists examined the immune system of men with HIV who started taking HIV medication immediately after infection (acute HIV infection) and compared it with people who started taking HIV medication later, in the chronic phase. The immune system was also compared with that of people without HIV. The researchers mainly looked at the role of certain immune cells, so-called monocytes, which are important for the initial defense against viruses.\nThe research shows that people who start taking HIV medication in the acute phase still have a well-functioning immune system in the beginning. This immune response is similar to that of people without HIV. But three years after the start of treatment, the immune cells have become dysfunctional, blood tests show. The cells then no longer react as they do in healthy people: The production of important pro-inflammatory proteins decreases.\nThis finding is striking, because until now it was thought that starting HIV inhibitors very early actually prevents permanent damage to the immune system. However, the current results show that this advantage is only temporary.\nAccording to Godelieve de Bree, internist-infectiologist at Amsterdam UMC, \u201cOur research shows that after an acute HIV infection, there is a limited period in which the immune system still responds normally, but that this protection disappears over the years, even with successful treatment. This makes it clear that in HIV infection and treatment, it is important to continue to look for ways to protect the immune system in a truly sustainable way.\u201d\nTheo Geijtenbeek, professor of immunology at Amsterdam UMC, also emphasizes the importance of this discovery, stating, \u201cThis is really new. Our results show that early treatment does provide temporary benefit, but that after a few years, dysregulation still occurs in the immune system. Our results show that the so-called \u2018window of opportunity\u2019 in which the immune system responds well is probably only in the first months after infection.\u201d\nThis requires new treatment systems that also protect the immune system in the longer term. Further research must show why this happens, and how this disruption can be prevented.\n\u201cThese insights are relevant for future HIV treatment,\u201d says de Bree. \u201cWe must focus on better protection of the immune system, even after the first period.\u201d\nMore information: Treatment in acute HIV infection only temporarily preserves monocyte function: a comparative cohort study in adult males, eBioMedicine (2025).\nSource : Medical Xpress\nAre you living with HIV/AIDS?

NK cells are naturally equipped to kill cells that lack these self-identifying molecules, which in most cases means virally infected cells. Certain viruses have evolved to trick the cells they infect into removing MHC molecules from their surface. This allows the viruses to fly under the radar of T cells, which require MHC for their action.\nLuckily, removing MHC makes the infected cells vulnerable to killing by NK cells.\nCancer cells also sometimes remove their MHC molecules, which means that T cells can\u2019t protect us from these transformed cells, but NK cells can.\nBiology textbooks usually refer to NK cells as part of the innate immune system. This is the system of immune defenses that are present from birth and are always active. Innate immune cells are good at stopping invaders at the gate, but they don\u2019t stick around after a fight, and they don\u2019t learn from past experience.\nThis description doesn\u2019t apply very well to NK cells, it turns out. \u201cNK cells remember, and they can persist in the body for long periods of time,\u201d explains Dr. Sun, whose lab discovered some of these previously unrecognized properties of NK cells. \u201cThis makes them more like the T or B cells of the adaptive immune system.\u201d\nDr. Sun discovered these adaptive qualities of NK cells while he was a postdoctoral fellow in Lewis Lanier\u2019s lab at UCSF. \u201cPeople were very skeptical at first because, for the longest time, the dogma was that NK cells are innate. Anytime you challenge what\u2019s written in a textbook, you\u2019re going to get some backlash from certain folks in the community,\u201d he explains.\nBut over time, he says, more and more evidence in both mice and humans has supported his findings. \u201cI think it\u2019s far more accepted now,\u201d he says.\nIt makes sense: NK cells, T cells, and B cells all develop from the same precursor cell, called a common lymphoid progenitor. They\u2019re basically siblings.\nScientists have begun exploring the use of NK cells in cancer immunotherapy. Some groups have equipped NK cells with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), in the hopes that these cells will prove safer or more effective than CAR T cells, for example.\nAnd NK cells may be playing an unacknowledged role in other types of immunotherapy. Like T cells, NK cells have immune checkpoint molecules, such as CTLA-4 and PD-1. These molecules function like brakes on immune cell activity. They are common targets for the immunotherapy drugs called checkpoint inhibitors. While T cells get most of the credit for the sometimes dramatic responses seen in people receiving these drugs, it could be that NK cells are also contributing to the effect.\n\u201cWhat some T cell biologists probably don\u2019t recognize, or just happily ignore, is that you\u2019re probably unleashing \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

If left untreated, HIV is the virus kills infected cells directly ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nLearn about Human Immunodeficiency Virus and how it causes Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the cause of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV infects and destroys immune cells called CD4 T cells or T helper cells. Overtime the number of your immune cells will decrease as they are killed by the virus, which leads to AIDS. AIDS is when your immune system is significantly weakened by the virus, and you start to experience complications of a weakened immune system. Today, HIV treatment is highly effective at preventing HIV infection from progressing to AIDS and allowing people living with HIV to lead long lives.\nGlobally: In 2024, 40.8 million people worldwide were living with HIV and 1.3 million new people became infected with the virus.\nUS incidence: In 2024, 1.2 million people in the US were living with HIV and 31,800 new people became infected with the virus.\nSince the beginning of the HIV epidemic in 1981, 91.4 million people have been infected with the virus and 44.1 million have died from HIV-related causes.\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus that infects and destroys immune cells. HIV spreads through contact with bodily fluids including blood, semen, vaginal fluids, and breastmilk. This means HIV can spread through activities such as unprotected sex, sharing needles or syringes, or from mother to baby.\nOnce HIV enters the body, it infects T helper cells (also known as CD4 T cells). When HIV enters a T helper cell, it permanently inserts its viral DNA into the cell\u2019s DNA. The virus has now hijacked the T helper cell, using it to make more copies of the virus. The viral DNA from HIV also becomes permanently part of an infected T helper cell\u2019s DNA. This makes it very difficult for the immune system to find and kill the virus. Because of HIV\u2019s ability to quickly hide within your cells and because it mutates very often, developing a vaccine to prevent HIV is very challenging.\nThe first stage of HIV infection is called acute HIV. This is when someone is first infected with HIV and may experience mild flu-like symptoms or no symptoms at all. This can then progress to chronic infection where HIV will continue to replicate inside T helper cells, slowly killing them and infecting more cells. At this stage, it\u2019s likely that the infected person won\u2019t experience any noticeable symptoms. During this time, they can still transmit HIV, even if they don\u2019t realize they have it.\nHIV infection can affect anyone. To learn more or be tested for the virus, talk to a doctor or visit a local health clinic.\nThe final stage of HIV infection is acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). This is when the number of T helper cells becomes very low. This happens years after initial infection and the immune system has been severely weakened by the virus. The T helper cells that HIV infects and destroys are crucial for activating other immune cells to coordinate an immune response. As the number of T helper cells decreases, the immune system becomes weaker, unable to fight off simple infections or prevent the development of cancer.\nA person with AIDS is more likely to get opportunistic infections, which are infections a healthy immune system could normally prevent. They are also more likely to develop certain types of cancer. These infections and cancers are called AIDS-defining illnesses. They occur because the T helper cells that are supposed to help initiate immune responses are too weak to respond. Some examples include Kaposi sarcoma, tuberculosis, or chronic herpes ulcers.\nHIV treatment and prevention have come a long way, but there is no cure. Today, HIV treatment can prevent HIV infection from progressing to AIDS. When taking HIV treatment as prescribed, many people live long lives. Treatment can even reduce HIV to undetectable levels in person, meaning there is so little virus active in your blood that a test cannot detect it. This doesn\u2019t mean you are cured, but it does mean your treatment is working very effectively. Researchers have even determined that when HIV levels are undetectable and stay undetectable, the virus cannot be transmitted. Immunology research over the last 40 years contributed to these major advancements in HIV treatment that allow people to live decades with little to no symptoms of HIV infection.\nImmunology research is continuing to advance HIV treatments and even help find a cure for the infection. Immunotherapy, treatment that enhances the immune system\u2019s ability to fight disease, is providing promise for people with HIV. A study in 2022, found that a cancer immunotherapy, pembrolizumab, can reverse HIV\u2019s ability to hide in immune cells. The virus\u2019s ability to hide is a major barrier to curing HIV, and immunotherapies like this may be a key step in reaching a cure.\nmRNA vaccines are also showing incredible promise in curing HIV. One study found that mRNA can be delivered to the cells where HIV is hiding and provide instructions to the cell that reveal the virus. Being able to reveal the virus and prevent it from hiding can lead to drugs that permanently eliminate HIV from the body. Another study using mRNA vaccines, successfully trained the immune system to recognize and fight HIV, a major battle in developing successful HIV vaccines. With continued advances in immunology and personalized medicine, researchers hope new technology like mRNA vaccines and immunotherpay will finally lead to a cure for HIV.\nThe American Association of Immunologists (\u201cAAI\u201d) websites (www.aai.org, www.immunologyexplained.org, and all related webpages, the \u201cWebsites\u201d) include information meant to inform visitors (\u201cUsers\u201d) about immunology and its related disciplines.

CD28 is the primary costimulatory receptor for T cells that acts through interaction with its ligands, CD80 and CD86 expressed on APCs. Costimulation is essential for T-cell activation since signal one TCR/antigen recognition in the absence of signal two drives the cell toward an anergic and/or tolerogenic state.1 Additional costimulatory receptors that can enhance T-cell activation include CD27, OX40 (CD134), ICOS (CD278), CD40L (CD154), CD226 that bind to CD70, OX40L (CD252), B7-H2 (CD275), CD40, and CD155/CD112, respectively, on APCs.2 The concentration of costimulatory and ligand molecules can vary significantly such that either no positive signal is sent or a paired interaction provides a strong supporting signal two to the T cells.

Signal three is responsible for terminating the immune response. Inhibitory receptors, also called immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), exert their influence on T-cell activation at this stage where under normal conditions, ICIs including programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1), cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), LAG3 (lymphocyte activation gene protein), and TIM3 (T-cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain-containing protein 3) are transiently upregulated on the surface of effector T cells within hours to days following T-cell activation. Here, their purpose is to attenuate T-cell activation and limit immune function at the end stages of an acute infection when a pathogen is controlled. Upon clearance of antigen, the expression of these ICIs on memory T cells declines to normal levels over time. Termination of the T-cell response is an essential self-limiting mechanisms to help preserve self-tolerance. However, in the case of chronic infection or cancer when the immune response is incapable of clearing the foreign antigen and there persistent chronic stimulation, T cells can enter a dysfunctional state called exhaustion.\nT-cell exhaustion is a progressive condition with increasing loss in effector function coinciding with increased expression levels and assortment of ICIs.

T-cell exhaustion mediated through PD-1 relies on interaction with its cognate ligands, PDL-1 and PD-L2, which regulate the delicate balance between immune defense and the protection of healthy tissue. Immune cells, non-immune endothelial, and epithelial cells constitutively express PDL-1, while PDL-2 expression is limited to APCs.

New Study Reveals the Steps\n\nGoogle Search Snippet:\nA new study reveals for the first time the steps through which human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) binds to the receptors on the membranes of T cells.\n\nFull Page Content:\nImmune to Cancer: The CRI Blog\nMatthew Tontonoz\nHIV, the virus that causes AIDS, has a talent for spreading between cells of the immune system. Through a process called budding, virus particles are released from an infected cell as little blobs that protrude outward and then pinch off from the cell membrane. Once released from the host cell, the virus particles are free to move to other cells and infect them.\nThis budding process is emblematic of HIV and other viruses that are surrounded by a membrane, or envelope. Each virus particle takes a bit of cell membrane with it when it departs. By slowly denuding the immune cell of its membrane, the virus kills its host cell. When enough immune cells die, the result is immunodeficiency, or AIDS.\nFor many years, it was believed that this budding process represented a new type of cellular behavior induced by the virus\u2014as if (to use a modern analogy) your computer started sending emails without your permission. Now, researchers with NYU School of Medicine propose that HIV is co-opting a normal form of cell behavior\u2014attaching itself to an email you were sending anyway.\nIn an article published in this week\u2019s Nature, CRI postdoctoral fellow Kaushik Choudhuri, DPhil, and colleagues present evidence that HIV uses the same process that certain immune cells, called T cells, use to communicate with other immune cells.\nT cells facilitate an immune response against pathogens\u2014things like viruses or bacteria\u2014and also against cancer. Receptors located on the surface of a T cell are like the cell\u2019s \u201ceyes,\u201d allowing it to see and recognize signs of these dangerous invaders. When a T cell receptor recognizes and binds to a distinctive marker, or antigen, from a pathogen, the T cell becomes activated. Activated T cells kill infected cells directly and also signal other cells of the immune system to act, triggering an immune response.\nT cells only stay active for a brief period of time, at which point they shut down their receptors. (This shutting down is necessary to prevent autoimmunity.) The accepted process by which T cells shut down their signaling is by internalizing the T cell receptors, smuggling them back inside the cell. But new research suggests that something different is going on.\nWhat Choudhuri and colleagues have found is that immune cells also release T cell receptors (TCR) from the cell surface into the space outside the cell. Blobs of cytoplasm and membrane studded with TCRs pinch off from the cell and drift away, much like HIV particles do. They suggest that this budding serves two purposes: 1) it helps shut down an immune response; and 2) it packages up TCRs for delivery to neighboring immune cells awaiting news of invaders.\n\u201cOur discovery that TCR is shed in extracellular microvesicles suggests a radically different fate and function for TCR,\u201d says Choudhuri, who works in the lab of Dr. Michael Dustin at NYU School of Medicine. \u201cFor instance we think that these microvesicles may convey intercellular messages to partner cells.\u201d\nChoudhuri says he and his colleagues were not thinking about HIV when they began their work. Rather, they were more interested in understanding the basic structure and function of the immunological synapse\u2014the region of communication between two adjacent immune cells. It was only when they discovered that the TCR vesicle shedding process relies on the same protein machinery used in HIV budding that they suspected a link. They strengthened their case for a common mechanism by showing that HIV infection antagonizes, or competes with, the making of TCR vesicles.\nIt is a cruel irony that HIV infection appears to spread by co-opting the process by which immune cells communicate with each other. After all, the immune system is designed to protect us from invading pathogens. Communication between immune cells is necessary to keep us safe. HIV devilishly uses that same communication system to spread its deadly message from cell to cell.\nThis process may also suggest why HIV is so difficult to fully eradicate. Researchers have known for a long time that HIV infects CD4+ \u201chelper\u201d T cells, the depletion of which eviscerates the immune system and leaves the patient vulnerable to opportunistic infections. Other immune cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells also become infected but are not killed by the virus. These cells can become \u201creservoirs\u201d of virus hiding out in the body.\n\u201cDespite a lot of progress in treating and controlling HIV infection, it is clear that the virus can persist in reservoirs in the body at low levels even with highly active retroviral therapy,\u201d says Choudhuri. \u201cWe think that our results suggest a way for infected T cells to pass on the virus to these reservoirs\u2014dendritic cells and macrophages, or even other T cells\u2014especially when the infected T cells are interacting with these cells in response to an unrelated infection.\u201d\nChoudhuri\u2019s research is relevant to more than HIV/AIDS. In addition to protecting us from infectious diseases, the immune system also wages a constant battle against cancer. By providing us with basic insights into how the immune system operates, Choudhuri\u2019s work provides cancer immunologists with more tools with which to design better treatments. For example, his team is working on ways to make synthetic forms of these microvesicles that might serve to boost the immune system into fighting tumor cells.\nAnother reason this research is significant is that Choudhuri and his colleagues employed a powerful new approach to viewing cells at the ultramicroscopic level, one that marries cutting-edge light and electron microscopy techniques. \u201cWe anticipate that these techniques will unveil entirely new vistas of the cell biology of T cell activation,\u201d Choudhuri says.\nCRI has a long history of funding such basic immunological research, including research on HIV.

The immune system was also compared with that of people without HIV. The researchers mainly looked at the role of certain immune cells, so-called monocytes, which are important for the initial defense against viruses.\nThe research shows that people who start taking HIV medication in the acute phase still have a well-functioning immune system in the beginning.

The cells then no longer react as they do in healthy people: The production of important pro-inflammatory proteins decreases.\nThis finding is striking, because until now it was thought that starting HIV inhibitors very early actually prevents permanent damage to the immune system.

Video courtesy of Morgan Huse.\nScientists are coming to appreciate the importance of a specific type of immune cell that keeps people free from disease.\nMost people familiar with the immune system have heard of T cells. These versatile immune cells, which protect us from infections and cancer, have been the focus of immunotherapy \u2014 approaches that use the body\u2019s immune system to fight cancer.\nLesser known, but no less important to healthy immune function, is an immune cell called a natural killer (NK) cell. These specialized fighters destroy damaged or stressed cells, including those infected with viruses and ones showing signs of genetic damage.\nNK cells are experiencing something of a renaissance these days. Scientists are finding they can\u2019t fully understand the body\u2019s response to cancer without taking these cells into account.\nIn 2016, for instance, scientists at the Sloan Kettering Institute discovered that NK cells play a role in metastatic latency. This means that they help keep rogue cancer cells in check and prevent the disease from growing and spreading.\nAnd just last month, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) found that the presence of NK cells in a tumor may help explain why some people respond to certain types of immunotherapy while others do not.\nSo what sets these Quentin Tarantino\u2013esque cells apart from other immune cells?\nAs their name implies, natural killer cells have a special ability to kill their targets without needing to be trained. This contrasts with other immune cells, like T cells, which have to learn how to recognize danger.\nNK cells have two main ways of taking out threats. One is by detecting the presence of stress signals emitted by cells in trouble, including those with genetic damage that might lead to cancer. These stress signals cue NK cells to kill them, in a kind of altruistic self-sacrifice.\n\u201cI tell my students that stressed cells put up \u2018kill me\u2019 flags,\u201d says Joseph Sun, an immunologist in SKI and a professor at the Gerstner Sloan Kettering Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences who studies NK cells.\nThe other way NK cells protect us is by recognizing cells that lack identifiable markers of \u201cself.\u201d Each of our cells has a molecule on it called MHC that differentiates our cells from other people\u2019s cells. NK cells are naturally equipped to kill cells that lack these self-identifying molecules, which in most cases means virally infected cells. Certain viruses have evolved to trick the cells they infect into removing MHC molecules from their surface. This allows the viruses to fly under the radar of T cells, which require MHC for their action.\nLuckily, removing MHC makes the infected cells vulnerable to killing by NK cells.\nCancer cells also sometimes remove their MHC molecules, which means that T cells can\u2019t protect us from these transformed cells, but NK cells can.\nBiology textbooks usually refer to NK cells as part of the innate immune system. This is the system of immune defenses that are present from birth and are always active. Innate immune cells are good at stopping invaders at the gate, but they don\u2019t stick around after a fight, and they don\u2019t learn from past experience.\nThis description doesn\u2019t apply very well to NK cells, it turns out. \u201cNK cells remember, and they can persist in the body for long periods of time,\u201d explains Dr. Sun, whose lab discovered some of these previously unrecognized properties of NK cells. \u201cThis makes them more like the T or B cells of the adaptive immune system.\u201d\nDr. Sun discovered these adaptive qualities of NK cells while he was a postdoctoral fellow in Lewis Lanier\u2019s lab at UCSF. \u201cPeople were very skeptical at first because, for the longest time, the dogma was that NK cells are innate. Anytime you challenge what\u2019s written in a textbook, you\u2019re going to get some backlash from certain folks in the community,\u201d he explains.\nBut over time, he says, more and more evidence in both mice and humans has supported his findings. \u201cI think it\u2019s far more accepted now,\u201d he says.\nIt makes sense: NK cells, T cells, and B cells all develop from the same precursor cell, called a common lymphoid progenitor. They\u2019re basically siblings.\nScientists have begun exploring the use of NK cells in cancer immunotherapy. Some groups have equipped NK cells with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), in the hopes that these cells will prove safer or more effective than CAR T cells, for example.\nAnd NK cells may be playing an unacknowledged role in other types of immunotherapy. Like T cells, NK cells have immune checkpoint molecules, such as CTLA-4 and PD-1. These molecules function like brakes on immune cell activity. They are common targets for the immunotherapy drugs called checkpoint inhibitors. While T cells get most of the credit for the sometimes dramatic responses seen in people receiving these drugs, it could be that NK cells are also contributing to the effect.\n\u201cWhat some T cell biologists probably don\u2019t recognize, or just happily ignore, is that you\u2019re probably unleashing \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

These can suppress viral replication, reduce viral load, and stop disease progression, but they can't target hidden proviruses.\nThat means antiretroviral therapy can subdue but not eliminate HIV, forcing many patients to continue treatment indefinitely or risk a viral rebound.\nPrevious research shows HIV can linger in a variety of body tissues, including the brain, kidneys, liver, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract, among others.\nThe immune system's T helper cells are the main latent reservoir, but not the only one. HIV also hides in skin cells, white blood cells, and organ-specific cells such as podocytes from the kidneys and support cells for neurons.\nMany details of HIV latency remain poorly understood, including not just where the virus hides but also how it infiltrates diverse tissues and cell types and then settles in.\nAccording to the new study, HIV achieves this with a tissue-specific approach, cloaking itself in a host cell's DNA by adjusting its behavior to fit the setting. In the brain, for example, it avoids genes and hides in less active regions of DNA.\n\"We found that HIV doesn't integrate randomly. Instead, it follows unique patterns in different tissues, possibly shaped by the local environment and immune responses,\" says microbiologist Stephen Barr from Western University in Ontario.\n\"This helps explain how HIV manages to persist in the body for decades, and why certain tissues may act as reservoirs of infection.\"\nThe study examined tissue samples from participants' blood, colon, esophagus, small intestine, and stomach, along with unmatched brain tissue.\nThe authors analyzed how often HIV integrated itself into specific parts of the host genome, then compared the patterns they observed across different body tissues from different people.\n\"Knowing where the virus hides in our genomes will help us identify ways to target those cells and tissues with targeted therapeutic approaches \u2013 either by eliminating these cells or 'silencing' the virus,\" says molecular virologist Guido van Marle from the University of Calgary.\nThe researchers discovered this using rare tissue samples collected from patients during the early years of the HIV/ AIDS pandemic, before modern treatments were available.\nThat allowed them to observe the virus in its natural state across multiple organs from the same individuals, revealing not only new details about HIV but also the scientific value of preserving historic samples.\n\"Our study is a powerful example of how we can learn from historic samples to better understand a virus that continues to affect tens of millions of people worldwide,\" Barr says. These samples exist thanks to people who volunteered for HIV research early in the pandemic.\n\"Their willingness to contribute samples, at a time of stigma, fear, and with limited treatment options, was an act of bravery, foresight, and generosity that continues to advance scientific understanding of HIV and save lives today,\" van Marle says.\nThe study was published in Communications Medicine.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Most inflammatory markers decline during the first several months of ART and may achieve a stable \u201csetpoint\u201d within 1 to 2 years.21,22 In observational studies, people with HIV who initiated ART during acute HIV infection appeared to achieve a lower immune activation setpoint during ART-mediated viral suppression than those who started ART at later disease stages.23 These data reinforce the recommendation to start ART as soon as possible after HIV diagnosis, regardless of CD4 count (see Initiation of Antiretroviral Therapy).\nCurrently, data do not support intensifying or modifying ART as a strategy to reduce immune activation after viral suppression is already achieved. For example, adding antiretroviral (ARV) drugs to an already suppressive regimen (or ART intensification) does not consistently improve immune activation.24-28 Although some studies have suggested that switching an ARV regimen to one with a more favorable lipid profile may improve some markers of immune activation and inflammation, these studies have limitations, and results are not consistent across markers or among studies.29-31 Thus, adding or switching ARVs solely to reduce immune activation or inflammation is not recommended, except in a clinical trial (AII).\nTreatment strategies targeting immune activation and inflammation have been a focus of ongoing investigation. In this context, research strategies to mitigate inflammation among people with HIV on suppressive ART have typically taken one of three approaches: (1) target the root drivers of immune activation specific to HIV disease, (2) downregulate inflammatory pathways broadly, or (3) leverage anti-inflammatory properties of medications targeting traditional risk factors.\nThe HIV-related mechanisms driving immune activation have been posited to include viral persistence, permanent injury impairing immune recovery (i.e., due to lymphatic tissue fibrosis), presence of copathogens, as well as dysbiosis and microbial translocation.32-36 Among these mechanisms, investigational approaches have targeted HIV reactivation from latently infected cells, fibrotic pathways, the gut microbiome, and cytomegalovirus coinfection.27,37-41 However, thus far, none of these strategies have improved clinical outcomes. Therefore, these interventions should be pursued only in the context of clinical trials.\nData have emerged demonstrating the potential clinical benefit of broadly anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive strategies among people without HIV who are at high risk for ASCVD events. The CANTOS trial (Canakinumab Anti-Inflammatory Thrombosis Outcomes Study) studied canakinumab, a human monoclonal antibody targeting cytokine interleukin-1b, a driver of the IL-6 signaling pathway, as a secondary prevention strategy among people with known ASCVD who do not have HIV. CANTOS demonstrated a treatment effect for reducing inflammation, as well as cardiovascular events and cancer death, in the general population.42 In people with HIV, canakinumab and tocilizumab, inhibitors of the receptor for IL-6, have been shown to reduce blood levels of markers of inflammation and immune activation.43,44 However, it is unclear whether the potential risks of these immunomodulatory therapies, including the increased sepsis risk seen in the CANTOS trial,42 outweigh their possible benefits for people with HIV, particularly with long-term use. Therefore, the clinical use of immunomodulatory or anti-inflammatory therapy solely to reduce HIV-associated immune activation or inflammation is not recommended among people with HIV, except in a clinical trial (AII).\nFinally, beyond the well-established clinical benefit for reducing ASCVD events, hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (or HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, also known as statins, have been shown to improve biomarker levels of inflammation (e.g., hsCRP) and immune activation in the general population.45,46 In this context, data from REPRIEVE (Randomized Trial to Prevent Vascular Events in HIV) have demonstrated a reduction in cardiovascular events with pitavastatin use among people with HIV (see Statin Therapy in People With HIV). Other commonly used medications with anti-inflammatory properties\u2014such as aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, methotrexate, and angiotensin receptor blockers\u2014have failed to consistently reduce biomarkers of immune acti\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This activated T-cell response can inflict an overwhelming degree of damage to the targeted cells, which in most instances leads to the control and elimination of foreign invaders. However, in conditions of chronic infection, persistent exposure of T cells to high levels of antigen results in a severe T-cell dysfunctional state called exhaustion. T-cell exhaustion leads to a suboptimal immune-mediated control of multiple viral infections including the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In this review, we will discuss the role of T-cell exhaustion in HIV disease progression, the long-term defect of T-cell function even in aviremic patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART), the role of exhaustion-specific markers in maintaining a reservoir of latently infected cells, and exploiting these markers in HIV cure strategies.\nThe T-cell activation paradigm proceeds in a highly organized process involving three signals consisting of antigen recognition, receptor costimulation, and a termination signal that are required for the tight regulation of a strong functional and proliferative response.\nSignal one in T-cell activation represents the specific recognition through the T-cell receptor (TCR) of their cognate antigen presented by professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) including dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells.\nSignal two is the costimulatory signal where receptors on the T cells bind to their counterpart ligands. CD28 is the primary costimulatory receptor for T cells that acts through interaction with its ligands, CD80 and CD86 expressed on APCs. Costimulation is essential for T-cell activation since signal one TCR/antigen recognition in the absence of signal two drives the cell toward an anergic and/or tolerogenic state.1 Additional costimulatory receptors that can enhance T-cell activation include CD27, OX40 (CD134), ICOS (CD278), CD40L (CD154), CD226 that bind to CD70, OX40L (CD252), B7-H2 (CD275), CD40, and CD155/CD112, respectively, on APCs.2 The concentration of costimulatory and ligand molecules can vary significantly such that either no positive signal is sent or a paired interaction provides a strong supporting signal two to the T cells. Soluble pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-12 and type I interferons contribute to a fully activated T-cell response.\nSignal three arises in the days following T-cell activation, the effector phase of the immune response, and eventually the elimination of the pathogen. Signal three is responsible for terminating the immune response. Inhibitory receptors, also called immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), exert their influence on T-cell activation at this stage where under normal conditions, ICIs including programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1), cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), LAG3 (lymphocyte activation gene protein), and TIM3 (T-cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain-containing protein 3) are transiently upregulated on the surface of effector T cells within hours to days following T-cell activation. Here, their purpose is to attenuate T-cell activation and limit immune function at the end stages of an acute infection when a pathogen is controlled. Upon clearance of antigen, the expression of these ICIs on memory T cells declines to normal levels over time. Termination of the T-cell response is an essential self-limiting mechanisms to help preserve self-tolerance. However, in the case of chronic infection or cancer when the immune response is incapable of clearing the foreign antigen and there persistent chronic stimulation, T cells can enter a dysfunctional state called exhaustion.\nT-cell exhaustion is a progressive condition with increasing loss in effector function coinciding with increased expression levels and assortment of ICIs. PD-1 is recognized as the master inhibitory regulator of T-cell function but with increased degrees of exhaustion comes elevated levels of additional ICIs including CTLA-4, TIM3, LAG3, T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT), 2B4 (CD244), and CD1603, 4 (Figure 1). T-cell exhaustion mediated through PD-1 relies on interaction with its cognate ligands, PDL-1 and PD-L2, which regulate the delicate balance between immune defense and the protection of healthy tissue. Immune cells, non-immune endothelial, and epithelial cells constitutively express PDL-1, while PDL-2 expression is limited to APCs. The expression of PDL-1 is further upregulated after activation, which modulates the immune responses against self and foreign antigens.5 In a likewise fashion, the interaction of additional ICIs with their respective ligands exert a further level of control and suppression of T-cell function.\nIn exhausted CD8 T cells, the increased expression of ICIs leads to a hierarchical loss of function that begins with reduced IL-2 secretion, cytokine polyfunctionality, and diminished proliferative potential.

Paradoxically, some ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nDespite effective HIV medication, the immune system of people with HIV remains disrupted in the long term.\nResearchers at Amsterdam UMC investigated whether this dysregulation can be prevented by starting HIV medication immediately after infection, i.e., within a few days. They saw that six months after this early treatment, the immune system did indeed work as in people without HIV. But in the longer term, the immune system was disrupted again. This is shown by research by Amsterdam UMC, published in the journal eBioMedicine.\nFor this study, the scientists examined the immune system of men with HIV who started taking HIV medication immediately after infection (acute HIV infection) and compared it with people who started taking HIV medication later, in the chronic phase. The immune system was also compared with that of people without HIV. The researchers mainly looked at the role of certain immune cells, so-called monocytes, which are important for the initial defense against viruses.\nThe research shows that people who start taking HIV medication in the acute phase still have a well-functioning immune system in the beginning. This immune response is similar to that of people without HIV. But three years after the start of treatment, the immune cells have become dysfunctional, blood tests show. The cells then no longer react as they do in healthy people: The production of important pro-inflammatory proteins decreases.\nThis finding is striking, because until now it was thought that starting HIV inhibitors very early actually prevents permanent damage to the immune system. However, the current results show that this advantage is only temporary.\nAccording to Godelieve de Bree, internist-infectiologist at Amsterdam UMC, \u201cOur research shows that after an acute HIV infection, there is a limited period in which the immune system still responds normally, but that this protection disappears over the years, even with successful treatment. This makes it clear that in HIV infection and treatment, it is important to continue to look for ways to protect the immune system in a truly sustainable way.\u201d\nTheo Geijtenbeek, professor of immunology at Amsterdam UMC, also emphasizes the importance of this discovery, stating, \u201cThis is really new. Our results show that early treatment does provide temporary benefit, but that after a few years, dysregulation still occurs in the immune system. Our results show that the so-called \u2018window of opportunity\u2019 in which the immune system responds well is probably only in the first months after infection.\u201d\nThis requires new treatment systems that also protect the immune system in the longer term. Further research must show why this happens, and how this disruption can be prevented.\n\u201cThese insights are relevant for future HIV treatment,\u201d says de Bree. \u201cWe must focus on better protection of the immune system, even after the first period.\u201d\nMore information: Treatment in acute HIV infection only temporarily preserves monocyte function: a comparative cohort study in adult males, eBioMedicine (2025).\nSource : Medical Xpress\nAre you living with HIV/AIDS?

Most inflammatory markers decline during the first several months of ART and may achieve a stable \u201csetpoint\u201d within 1 to 2 years.21,22 In observational studies, people with HIV who initiated ART during acute HIV infection appeared to achieve a lower immune activation setpoint during ART-mediated viral suppression than those who started ART at later disease stages.23 These data reinforce the recommendation to start ART as soon as possible after HIV diagnosis, regardless of CD4 count (see Initiation of Antiretroviral Therapy).\nCurrently, data do not support intensifying or modifying ART as a strategy to reduce immune activation after viral suppression is already achieved. For example, adding antiretroviral (ARV) drugs to an already suppressive regimen (or ART intensification) does not consistently improve immune activation.24-28 Although some studies have suggested that switching an ARV regimen to one with a more favorable lipid profile may improve some markers of immune activation and inflammation, these studies have limitations, and results are not consistent across markers or among studies.29-31 Thus, adding or switching ARVs solely to reduce immune activation or inflammation is not recommended, except in a clinical trial (AII).\nTreatment strategies targeting immune activation and inflammation have been a focus of ongoing investigation. In this context, research strategies to mitigate inflammation among people with HIV on suppressive ART have typically taken one of three approaches: (1) target the root drivers of immune activation specific to HIV disease, (2) downregulate inflammatory pathways broadly, or (3) leverage anti-inflammatory properties of medications targeting traditional risk factors.\nThe HIV-related mechanisms driving immune activation have been posited to include viral persistence, permanent injury impairing immune recovery (i.e., due to lymphatic tissue fibrosis), presence of copathogens, as well as dysbiosis and microbial translocation.32-36 Among these mechanisms, investigational approaches have targeted HIV reactivation from latently infected cells, fibrotic pathways, the gut microbiome, and cytomegalovirus coinfection.27,37-41 However, thus far, none of these strategies have improved clinical outcomes. Therefore, these interventions should be pursued only in the context of clinical trials.\nData have emerged demonstrating the potential clinical benefit of broadly anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive strategies among people without HIV who are at high risk for ASCVD events. The CANTOS trial (Canakinumab Anti-Inflammatory Thrombosis Outcomes Study) studied canakinumab, a human monoclonal antibody targeting cytokine interleukin-1b, a driver of the IL-6 signaling pathway, as a secondary prevention strategy among people with known ASCVD who do not have HIV. CANTOS demonstrated a treatment effect for reducing inflammation, as well as cardiovascular events and cancer death, in the general population.42 In people with HIV, canakinumab and tocilizumab, inhibitors of the receptor for IL-6, have been shown to reduce blood levels of markers of inflammation and immune activation.43,44 However, it is unclear whether the potential risks of these immunomodulatory therapies, including the increased sepsis risk seen in the CANTOS trial,42 outweigh their possible benefits for people with HIV, particularly with long-term use. Therefore, the clinical use of immunomodulatory or anti-inflammatory therapy solely to reduce HIV-associated immune activation or inflammation is not recommended among people with HIV, except in a clinical trial (AII).\nFinally, beyond the well-established clinical benefit for reducing ASCVD events, hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (or HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, also known as statins, have been shown to improve biomarker levels of inflammation (e.g., hsCRP) and immune activation in the general population.45,46 In this context, data from REPRIEVE (Randomized Trial to Prevent Vascular Events in HIV) have demonstrated a reduction in cardiovascular events with pitavastatin use among people with HIV (see Statin Therapy in People With HIV). Other commonly used medications with anti-inflammatory properties\u2014such as aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, methotrexate, and angiotensin receptor blockers\u2014have failed to consistently reduce biomarkers of immune acti\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

In this context, research strategies to mitigate inflammation among people with HIV on suppressive ART have typically taken one of three approaches: (1) target the root drivers of immune activation specific to HIV disease, (2) downregulate inflammatory pathways broadly, or (3) leverage anti-inflammatory properties of medications targeting traditional risk factors.\nThe HIV-related mechanisms driving immune activation have been posited to include viral persistence, permanent injury impairing immune recovery (i.e., due to lymphatic tissue fibrosis), presence of copathogens, as well as dysbiosis and microbial translocation.32-36 Among these mechanisms, investigational approaches have targeted HIV reactivation from latently infected cells, fibrotic pathways, the gut microbiome, and cytomegalovirus coinfection.27,37-41 However, thus far, none of these strategies have improved clinical outcomes. Therefore, these interventions should be pursued only in the context of clinical trials.\nData have emerged demonstrating the potential clinical benefit of broadly anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive strategies among people without HIV who are at high risk for ASCVD events. The CANTOS trial (Canakinumab Anti-Inflammatory Thrombosis Outcomes Study) studied canakinumab, a human monoclonal antibody targeting cytokine interleukin-1b, a driver of the IL-6 signaling pathway, as a secondary prevention strategy among people with known ASCVD who do not have HIV. CANTOS demonstrated a treatment effect for reducing inflammation, as well as cardiovascular events and cancer death, in the general population.42 In people with HIV, canakinumab and tocilizumab, inhibitors of the receptor for IL-6, have been shown to reduce blood levels of markers of inflammation and immune activation.43,44 However, it is unclear whether the potential risks of these immunomodulatory therapies, including the increased sepsis risk seen in the CANTOS trial,42 outweigh their possible benefits for people with HIV, particularly with long-term use. Therefore, the clinical use of immunomodulatory or anti-inflammatory therapy solely to reduce HIV-associated immune activation or inflammation is not recommended among people with HIV, except in a clinical trial (AII).\nFinally, beyond the well-established clinical benefit for reducing ASCVD events, hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (or HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, also known as statins, have been shown to improve biomarker levels of inflammation (e.g., hsCRP) and immune activation in the general population.45,46 In this context, data from REPRIEVE (Randomized Trial to Prevent Vascular Events in HIV) have demonstrated a reduction in cardiovascular events with pitavastatin use among people with HIV (see Statin Therapy in People With HIV). Other commonly used medications with anti-inflammatory properties\u2014such as aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, methotrexate, and angiotensin receptor blockers\u2014have failed to consistently reduce biomarkers of immune acti\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

They saw that six months after this early treatment, the immune system did indeed work as in people without HIV. But in the longer term, the immune system was disrupted again. This is shown by research by Amsterdam UMC, published in the journal eBioMedicine.\nFor this study, the scientists examined the immune system of men with HIV who started taking HIV medication immediately after infection (acute HIV infection) and compared it with people who started taking HIV medication later, in the chronic phase. The immune system was also compared with that of people without HIV. The researchers mainly looked at the role of certain immune cells, so-called monocytes, which are important for the initial defense against viruses.\nThe research shows that people who start taking HIV medication in the acute phase still have a well-functioning immune system in the beginning. This immune response is similar to that of people without HIV. But three years after the start of treatment, the immune cells have become dysfunctional, blood tests show. The cells then no longer react as they do in healthy people: The production of important pro-inflammatory proteins decreases.\nThis finding is striking, because until now it was thought that starting HIV inhibitors very early actually prevents permanent damage to the immune system. However, the current results show that this advantage is only temporary.\nAccording to Godelieve de Bree, internist-infectiologist at Amsterdam UMC, \u201cOur research shows that after an acute HIV infection, there is a limited period in which the immune system still responds normally, but that this protection disappears over the years, even with successful treatment. This makes it clear that in HIV infection and treatment, it is important to continue to look for ways to protect the immune system in a truly sustainable way.\u201d\nTheo Geijtenbeek, professor of immunology at Amsterdam UMC, also emphasizes the importance of this discovery, stating, \u201cThis is really new. Our results show that early treatment does provide temporary benefit, but that after a few years, dysregulation still occurs in the immune system. Our results show that the so-called \u2018window of opportunity\u2019 in which the immune system responds well is probably only in the first months after infection.\u201d\nThis requires new treatment systems that also protect the immune system in the longer term. Further research must show why this happens, and how this disruption can be prevented.\n\u201cThese insights are relevant for future HIV treatment,\u201d says de Bree. \u201cWe must focus on better protection of the immune system, even after the first period.\u201d\nMore information: Treatment in acute HIV infection only temporarily preserves monocyte function: a comparative cohort study in adult males, eBioMedicine (2025).\nSource : Medical Xpress\nAre you living with HIV/AIDS?

Through a process called budding, virus particles are released from an infected cell as little blobs that protrude outward and then pinch off from the cell membrane. Once released from the host cell, the virus particles are free to move to other cells and infect them.\nThis budding process is emblematic of HIV and other viruses that are surrounded by a membrane, or envelope. Each virus particle takes a bit of cell membrane with it when it departs. By slowly denuding the immune cell of its membrane, the virus kills its host cell. When enough immune cells die, the result is immunodeficiency, or AIDS.\nFor many years, it was believed that this budding process represented a new type of cellular behavior induced by the virus\u2014as if (to use a modern analogy) your computer started sending emails without your permission. Now, researchers with NYU School of Medicine propose that HIV is co-opting a normal form of cell behavior\u2014attaching itself to an email you were sending anyway.\nIn an article published in this week\u2019s Nature, CRI postdoctoral fellow Kaushik Choudhuri, DPhil, and colleagues present evidence that HIV uses the same process that certain immune cells, called T cells, use to communicate with other immune cells.\nT cells facilitate an immune response against pathogens\u2014things like viruses or bacteria\u2014and also against cancer. Receptors located on the surface of a T cell are like the cell\u2019s \u201ceyes,\u201d allowing it to see and recognize signs of these dangerous invaders. When a T cell receptor recognizes and binds to a distinctive marker, or antigen, from a pathogen, the T cell becomes activated. Activated T cells kill infected cells directly and also signal other cells of the immune system to act, triggering an immune response.\nT cells only stay active for a brief period of time, at which point they shut down their receptors. (This shutting down is necessary to prevent autoimmunity.) The accepted process by which T cells shut down their signaling is by internalizing the T cell receptors, smuggling them back inside the cell. But new research suggests that something different is going on.\nWhat Choudhuri and colleagues have found is that immune cells also release T cell receptors (TCR) from the cell surface into the space outside the cell. Blobs of cytoplasm and membrane studded with TCRs pinch off from the cell and drift away, much like HIV particles do. They suggest that this budding serves two purposes: 1) it helps shut down an immune response; and 2) it packages up TCRs for delivery to neighboring immune cells awaiting news of invaders.\n\u201cOur discovery that TCR is shed in extracellular microvesicles suggests a radically different fate and function for TCR,\u201d says Choudhuri, who works in the lab of Dr. Michael Dustin at NYU School of Medicine. \u201cFor instance we think that these microvesicles may convey intercellular messages to partner cells.\u201d\nChoudhuri says he and his colleagues were not thinking about HIV when they began their work. Rather, they were more interested in understanding the basic structure and function of the immunological synapse\u2014the region of communication between two adjacent immune cells. It was only when they discovered that the TCR vesicle shedding process relies on the same protein machinery used in HIV budding that they suspected a link. They strengthened their case for a common mechanism by showing that HIV infection antagonizes, or competes with, the making of TCR vesicles.\nIt is a cruel irony that HIV infection appears to spread by co-opting the process by which immune cells communicate with each other. After all, the immune system is designed to protect us from invading pathogens. Communication between immune cells is necessary to keep us safe. HIV devilishly uses that same communication system to spread its deadly message from cell to cell.\nThis process may also suggest why HIV is so difficult to fully eradicate. Researchers have known for a long time that HIV infects CD4+ \u201chelper\u201d T cells, the depletion of which eviscerates the immune system and leaves the patient vulnerable to opportunistic infections. Other immune cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells also become infected but are not killed by the virus. These cells can become \u201creservoirs\u201d of virus hiding out in the body.\n\u201cDespite a lot of progress in treating and controlling HIV infection, it is clear that the virus can persist in reservoirs in the body at low levels even with highly active retroviral therapy,\u201d says Choudhuri. \u201cWe think that our results suggest a way for infected T cells to pass on the virus to these reservoirs\u2014dendritic cells and macrophages, or even other T cells\u2014especially when the infected T cells are interacting with these cells in response to an unrelated infection.\u201d\nChoudhuri\u2019s research is relevant to more than HIV/AIDS. In addition to protecting us from infectious diseases, the immune system also wages a constant battle against cancer. By providing us with basic insights into how the immune system operates, Choudhuri\u2019s work provides cancer immunologists with more tools with which to design better treatments. For example, his team is working on ways to make synthetic forms of these microvesicles that might serve to boost the immune system into fighting tumor cells.\nAnother reason this research is significant is that Choudhuri and his colleagues employed a powerful new approach to viewing cells at the ultramicroscopic level, one that marries cutting-edge light and electron microscopy techniques. \u201cWe anticipate that these techniques will unveil entirely new vistas of the cell biology of T cell activation,\u201d Choudhuri says.\nCRI has a long history of funding such basic immunological research, including research on HIV.
