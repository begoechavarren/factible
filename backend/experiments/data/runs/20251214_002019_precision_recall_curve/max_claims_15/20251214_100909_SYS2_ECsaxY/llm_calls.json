Huq[1]\nIntroduction\nThe violence of January 6, 2021, embodied one threat to American democracy, and then gave rise to yet others. Rioters that day acted on then-President Donald Trump\u2019s exhortation to \u201cwalk down to the Capitol\u201d and then \u201cdemand that Congress do the right thing and only count the electors who have been lawfully slated.\u201d[2] What ensued placed Vice President Mike Pence and others at immediate risk of physical harm.[3] The ensuing extra-legal violence came startling close to a disabling or thwarting the counting of Electoral College votes, and so preventing the orderly handover of presidential power after an incumbent had lost at the polls.[4] It would have been the first time in more than two centuries that such a peaceful transfer of power failed to happen.\nRather than shining a clarifying light on the risks to American democracy, however, the events of January 6 have muddied those waters. Like a kaleidoscope, that day showed how fragmented Americans\u2019 shared understanding of the democratic project and its risks have become\u2014and then its aftermath shook those understandings up just a bit more. Since that day, belief in Trump\u2019s false claim of a stolen election has led to \u201csham \u2018audits\u2019\u201d and a wave of \u201cnew laws not only restricting the vote but also making it easier to sabotage election results\u201d among the several states, and the primary victory of several prominent advocates of the \u201cbig lie.\u201d[5] There is also little sign that belief among Republicans in the falsehood of a stolen presidential election has significantly abated. Indeed, the latter Big Lie, propagating through social media and cable news, is effectively a symptom, as well as a cause, of a broader, more diffuse, and yet more profound distemper\u2014a malady of the popular dispositions necessary for democracy to rule.\nSuperfically, this discontent might seem to have unexpected positive effects. A July 2022 Pew Research Trusts poll found a \u201cvast majority of Americans (85%) said that the U.S. political system either needs major changes (43%) or needs to be completely reformed (42%).\u201d[6] Under other circumstances, such an appetite for change might be healthy, and might be tapped to push through pro-democracy reforms. But this seems unlikely to happen in 2023. Instead, what will likely flow from such discontent in a season of rampant misinformation about election fraud, when even a public performance of murderous political violence is not enough to dislodge false beliefs, is not so likely be redemptive. January 6, in this fashion, poisons not just democratic practice but also the wellsprings that might feed its reform.\nHence, if the January 6 insurrection was\u2014and still remains\u2014a democratic emergency, it is very far from being a straightforward one. It does not invite a simple diagnosis. Nor does it obviously yield to straightforward remedies. To reflect upon it is instead to uncover a messy plurality of entangled crises. Each compels its own analytics, and its distinctive solutions.\nTo my mind, there are at least three different ways in which the January 6 insurrection manifests and enables a complex, multifaceted democratic emergency. This term is first an appropriate description of January 6 simply as an event\u2014an eruption of violence wreathed in constitutional slogans and defended, paradoxically in the name of (ordinarily nonviolent) democratic practice.[7] Second, that day also revealed an institutional crisis\u2014an unveiling of the fragility of democracy\u2019s legal foundations\u2014that might also be labeled an emergency. For example, January 6 cast an unflattering light on the creaky apparatus for counting Electoral College votes.[8] And third, as already intimated, it manifested a democratic emergency as in the sense of a sharp splintering of the shared public understandings that are essential for the peaceful back-and-forth of elected office via elections. Divergent understanding of supposedly basic empirical facts (e.g., which candidate won the 2020 election), as well as discordant views about what happened on January 6, constitute a crisis of public knowledge\u2014a sense that Americans no longer share a common ground of facts. This is an epistemic crisis as emergency.\nThese three emergencies run concurrently into each other. They intertwine, Ouroboros-like. And they interact in ways that mutually reinforce. Yet each also unfolds at a different pace; each has its own history. And each works via a distinctive modality\u2014violence, institutional failure, or misinformation. There is, of course, no single \u201cfix\u201d that can alleviate the ensuing amalgam of challenges. To the contrary, part of the challenge of the moment for American democracy is the interconnectedness and the simultaneity of emergencies flowing at different levels toward the same malign end.\nIn this Essay, I want to isolate one strand of the ensuing problematic\u2014without, to be clear, claiming to offer a resolution for all the multiple, difficult issues at play.[9] There is a historically pedigreed way of analyzing democracy through what is called the problematic of constitutional guardianship. I aim to consider here whether that lens has anything to teach us now. In a democratic system, this problematic asks, which institution(s) (if, indeed, any at all) should take the lead in responding to threats to the basic institutional structure of popular choice? This is not only the question of which institution (again, if any) should have been understood to have the power to act on an emergency basis to sudden, unanticipated threats to democracy\u2014most obviously through violence of the sort used on January 6, 2021\u2014but which institution can and should decide on the existence of any one of the three enumerated emergencies, so as to facilitate responsive state action?\nIn its classic form, the question of constitutional guardianship has been understood to demand the identification of a single institution, such as a court or an elected entity, to play this role across a range of dif\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Chaired by Idaho Senator Frank Church (D-ID), the committee was part of a series of investigations into intelligence abuses in 1975, dubbed the \"Year of Intelligence\", including its House counterpart, the Pike Committee, and the presidential Rockefeller Commission. The committee's efforts led to the establishment of the permanent US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.\nOne of the revelations of the committee include Operation MKULTRA, which involved the drugging of US citizens as part of human experimentation on mind control;[1][2] COINTELPRO, which involved the surveillance and infiltration of American political and civil-rights organizations;[3] Family Jewels, a set of reports detailing potentially illegal, inappropriate and otherwise sensitive activities conducted by the CIA;[4][5][6][7] and Operation Mockingbird, a purported campaign with domestic and foreign journalists operating as CIA assets and dozens of US news organizations providing cover for CIA activity,[8] although these particular allegations have been described as not \u201cgrounded in reality\u201d by historians.[9] Without identifying individuals by name, the Church Committee stated that it found 50 reporters, mostly stringers paid per story, who had official, but secret, relationships with the CIA.[9]\nIt also unearthed Project SHAMROCK, a program in which the major telecommunications companies shared their traffic with the NSA, and officially confirmed the existence of this signals intelligence agency to the public for the first time.\nBy the early years of the 1970s, a series of troubling reports had appeared in the press concerning U.S. intelligence activities. First came revelations by Army intelligence officer Christopher Pyle in January 1970 regarding the US Army's spying on the civilian population in the United States.[10] Senator Sam Ervin's investigations of military surveillance produced further revelations.[11]\nThen on December 22, 1974, The New York Times published a lengthy front-page article by investigative journalist Seymour Hersh detailing covert activities engaged in by the Central Intelligence Agency under Operation CHAOS to collect information on the political activities of American citizens.[12]\nThe resulting uproar led to the creation of the Church Committee, which was approved by the Senate on January 27, 1975, on a vote of 82 to 4.[13][14]\nThe Church Committee's final report was published in April 1976 in six books. Also published were seven volumes of Church Committee hearings in the Senate.[15]\nBefore the release of the final report, the committee also published an interim report titled \"Alleged Assassination Plots Involving Foreign Leaders\",[16] which investigated alleged attempts to assassinate foreign leaders, including Patrice Lumumba of Zaire, Rafael Trujillo of the Dominican Republic, Ngo Dinh Diem of South Vietnam, Gen. Ren\u00e9 Schneider of Chile, and Fidel Castro of Cuba. President Gerald Ford urged the Senate to withhold the report from the public, but failed,[17] and under recommendations and pressure by the committee, Ford issued Executive Order 11905 (ultimately replaced in 1981 by President Reagan's Executive Order 12333) to ban US sanctioned assassinations of foreign leaders.\nIn addition, the committee produced seven case studies on covert operations, but only the one on Chile was released, titled \"Covert Action in Chile: 1963\u20131973\".[18] The rest were kept secret at CIA's request.[15]\nAccording to a declassified National Security Agency history, the Church Committee also helped to uncover the NSA's Watch List. The information for the list was compiled into the so-called \"Rhyming Dictionary\" of biographical information, which at its peak held millions of names\u2014thousands of which were US citizens. Some prominent members of this list were Joanne Woodward, Thomas Watson, Walter Mondale, Art Buchwald, Arthur F. Burns, Gregory Peck, Otis G. Pike, Tom Wicker, Whitney Young, Howard Baker, Frank Church, David Dellinger, Ralph Abernathy, and others.[19]\nAnother revelation of the committee was the discovery of Operation SHAMROCK, in which the major telecommunications companies shared their traffic with the NSA from 1945 to the early 1970s. The information gathered in this operation fed directly into the Watch List. In 1975, the committee decided to unilaterally declassify the particulars of this operation, against the objections of President Ford's administration.[19]\nTogether, the Church Committee's reports have been said to constitute the most extensive review of intelligence activities ever made available to the public. Much of the contents were classified, but over 50,000 pages were declassified under the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992.\nThe commission also carried out an investigation into the November 22, 1963, assassination of John F. Kennedy, questioning 50 witnesses and accessing 3,000 documents. It focused on the actions of the FBI and CIA, and their support for the Warren Commission.\nThe Church commission raised the question of the possible connection between the plans to assassinate political leaders abroad, particularly in Cuba, and that of the 35th President of the United States.[20]\nThe Church Commission questioned the processes for obtaining information, blaming federal agencies for failing in their duties and responsibilities and concluding that the investigation into the assassination had been deficient.[20]\nIt participated in the creation of the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA), the second major investigation of the JFK assassination, from 1976 to 1979.[21]\nThe Church Co\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Except they will be the antithesis.\nThe 1975 Senate select committee, chaired by Sen. Frank Church, was a bipartisan, serious, carefully assembled investigation into alleged offenses by American intelligence agencies. It uncovered major abuses, which resulted in important reforms.\nThe current House panels, starting with the weirdly named \u201cweaponization\u201d subcommittee, are purely partisan, carelessly staffed, and have two purposes: to go after President Biden and his family ahead of the 2024 election and to vindicate Donald Trump from his many well-documented transgressions.\nBoth the Judiciary Committee and its \u201cweaponization\u201d subcommittee are chaired by Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who has promised \u201cdozens and dozens\u201d of whistleblowers to tell how U.S. intelligence agencies have been \u201cweaponized\u201d against Trump and conservatives. The third, the Oversight Committee, is chaired by Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.) with Jordan the ranking Republican.\nHouse Republicans see Jordan as the Democrats\u2019 worst nightmare. He does a James Cagney-like impersonation shedding his jacket, scowling, and making rapid-fire combative charges in the form of questions.\nThe record, however, suggests that Jordan is, as they say in Texas, all hat and no cattle.\nJordan was a ringleader in two Obama-era investigations. One looked into charges that the IRS was targeting conservative non-profits; it fizzled when it was revealed the agency was targeting both conservative and liberal non-profits for stretching the tax laws with their political activities. Jordan also was one of the loudest voices on the Benghazi inquest, which sought to blame then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for the death of four Americans at the hands of Libyan terrorists. It was a dud.\nThis may be worse.\nRep. Daniel Goldman (D-N.Y.), a freshman Democrat on two of these committees, was lead House Democratic counsel in the first Trump impeachment, and for ten years in U.S. Attorney\u2019s office, he prosecuted Russian mafiosos and organized crime mobsters. So far, what he sees from Jordan & Co. is they \u201cpontificate with almost no facts or evidence.\u201d Goldman said Jordan reminds him of a defense lawyer \u201cwho could poke some holes in the prosecutor\u2019s case but then lacks the expertise to put together his own case.\u201d\nThey want to paint Trump as a victim, Goldman says, but Trump\u2019s \u201cthe albatross around their neck\u201d with the multiple charges that the former president used intelligence and law enforcement agencies for his own personal political purposes.\nOf the 35,000 FBI employees, it shouldn\u2019t be hard to find a few disgruntled ex-agents \u2014 but anyone who has spent time with FBI personnel finds comical the notion that the bureau is populated by left-wing radicals.\nIn a detailed 315-page analysis, first reported by the New York Times, subcommittee Democrats said the initial witnesses \u2014 supposed whistleblowers \u2014 provided almost no specifics and had pedaled wild conspiracy charges; two had been paid by a Trump loyalist.\nIt\u2019s easy to see why former Democratic Sen. Gary Hart, a member of the Church committee, rejects any comparison with the weaponization panel and its partisan Republican bomb throwers: Jordan, Rep. Matt Goetz (R-Fla.), Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) and Darrell Issa (R-Calif.). They bear no resemblance to the Church Committee\u2019s stalwart conservatives, serious-minded Republicans like Barry Goldwater, John Tower and future Senate GOP leader Howard Baker.\nJim Risen, a top investigative reporter who is writing a book on the Church Committee and all the intelligence scandals it uncovered \u2014 plots to assassinate foreign leaders, eavesdropping on Americans, using journalists as CIA assets \u2014 says the Jordan effort instead \u201cseems destined to follow the patterns\u201d of the infamous Joe McCarthy witch hunts in the 1950s.\nA priority of Jordan\u2019s full committee reportedly is to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. There are no grounds \u2014 it\u2019s just a political sop to the Trump MAGA crowd. The only time a cabinet officer was impeached in American history was President Grant\u2019s war secretary 147 years ago. During the Obama administration, Jordan wanted to impeach John Koskinen, the well-regarded IRS commissioner.\nThe Oversight Committee also is off to an inauspicious start. Initially, the committee held a hearing to prove that Twitter caved to political pressure and took down and blocked a story about Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop weeks before the election. Except the witnesses arguably did more damage to the GOP premise than confirming it.\nChairman Comer claims he\u2019ll be fair-minded and says it\u2019s necessary to investigate Hunter Biden, who he has pronounced guilty of something because he apparently traded on his father\u2019s famous name and connections. In a bizarre charge, Comer suggested the president\u2019s late son, Beau, should have been prosecuted years ago. Comer brushed aside Democrats\u2019 request to also investigate Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law, who certainly appears to have parlayed his own White House connections to get a $2 billion investment from the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia.\nComer may indeed want to be a little fair-minded \u2013 but with so many committee Republicans from the \u201ccrazy caucus\u201d \u2014 including Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), Scott Perry (R-Pa.) and Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) \u2014 that\u2019s not an option.\nSerious oversight is an important congressional role. In the not-too-distant past, heavyweights like Reps. John Dingell, Henry Waxman and Tom Davis, a Republican, have conducted substantive important oversight investigations.\nThere are matters today\u2019s Republicans should look into: the Biden administration\u2019s botched withdrawal from Afghanistan; some fraud and abuse in the massive COVID relief funds doled out under both the Trump and Biden regimes, maybe a bi-partisan inquiry on China.\nBut unfortunately, House oversight will \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Chaired by Idaho Senator Frank Church (D-ID), the committee was part of a series of investigations into intelligence abuses in 1975, dubbed the \"Year of Intelligence\", including its House counterpart, the Pike Committee, and the presidential Rockefeller Commission. The committee's efforts led to the establishment of the permanent US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.\nOne of the revelations of the committee include Operation MKULTRA, which involved the drugging of US citizens as part of human experimentation on mind control;[1][2] COINTELPRO, which involved the surveillance and infiltration of American political and civil-rights organizations;[3] Family Jewels, a set of reports detailing potentially illegal, inappropriate and otherwise sensitive activities conducted by the CIA;[4][5][6][7] and Operation Mockingbird, a purported campaign with domestic and foreign journalists operating as CIA assets and dozens of US news organizations providing cover for CIA activity,[8] although these particular allegations have been described as not \u201cgrounded in reality\u201d by historians.[9] Without identifying individuals by name, the Church Committee stated that it found 50 reporters, mostly stringers paid per story, who had official, but secret, relationships with the CIA.[9]\nIt also unearthed Project SHAMROCK, a program in which the major telecommunications companies shared their traffic with the NSA, and officially confirmed the existence of this signals intelligence agency to the public for the first time.\nBy the early years of the 1970s, a series of troubling reports had appeared in the press concerning U.S. intelligence activities. First came revelations by Army intelligence officer Christopher Pyle in January 1970 regarding the US Army's spying on the civilian population in the United States.[10] Senator Sam Ervin's investigations of military surveillance produced further revelations.[11]\nThen on December 22, 1974, The New York Times published a lengthy front-page article by investigative journalist Seymour Hersh detailing covert activities engaged in by the Central Intelligence Agency under Operation CHAOS to collect information on the political activities of American citizens.[12]\nThe resulting uproar led to the creation of the Church Committee, which was approved by the Senate on January 27, 1975, on a vote of 82 to 4.[13][14]\nThe Church Committee's final report was published in April 1976 in six books. Also published were seven volumes of Church Committee hearings in the Senate.[15]\nBefore the release of the final report, the committee also published an interim report titled \"Alleged Assassination Plots Involving Foreign Leaders\",[16] which investigated alleged attempts to assassinate foreign leaders, including Patrice Lumumba of Zaire, Rafael Trujillo of the Dominican Republic, Ngo Dinh Diem of South Vietnam, Gen. Ren\u00e9 Schneider of Chile, and Fidel Castro of Cuba. President Gerald Ford urged the Senate to withhold the report from the public, but failed,[17] and under recommendations and pressure by the committee, Ford issued Executive Order 11905 (ultimately replaced in 1981 by President Reagan's Executive Order 12333) to ban US sanctioned assassinations of foreign leaders.\nIn addition, the committee produced seven case studies on covert operations, but only the one on Chile was released, titled \"Covert Action in Chile: 1963\u20131973\".[18] The rest were kept secret at CIA's request.[15]\nAccording to a declassified National Security Agency history, the Church Committee also helped to uncover the NSA's Watch List. The information for the list was compiled into the so-called \"Rhyming Dictionary\" of biographical information, which at its peak held millions of names\u2014thousands of which were US citizens.

In 1975, the committee decided to unilaterally declassify the particulars of this operation, against the objections of President Ford's administration.[19]\nTogether, the Church Committee's reports have been said to constitute the most extensive review of intelligence activities ever made available to the public. Much of the contents were classified, but over 50,000 pages were declassified under the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992.\nThe commission also carried out an investigation into the November 22, 1963, assassination of John F.

Chaired by Idaho Senator Frank Church (D-ID), the committee was part of a series of investigations into intelligence abuses in 1975, dubbed the \"Year of Intelligence\", including its House counterpart, the Pike Committee, and the presidential Rockefeller Commission. The committee's efforts led to the establishment of the permanent US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.\nOne of the revelations of the committee include Operation MKULTRA, which involved the drugging of US citizens as part of human experimentation on mind control;[1][2] COINTELPRO, which involved the surveillance and infiltration of American political and civil-rights organizations;[3] Family Jewels, a set of reports detailing potentially illegal, inappropriate and otherwise sensitive activities conducted by the CIA;[4][5][6][7] and Operation Mockingbird, a purported campaign with domestic and foreign journalists operating as CIA assets and dozens of US news organizations providing cover for CIA activity,[8] although these particular allegations have been described as not \u201cgrounded in reality\u201d by historians.[9] Without identifying individuals by name, the Church Committee stated that it found 50 reporters, mostly stringers paid per story, who had official, but secret, relationships with the CIA.[9]\nIt also unearthed Project SHAMROCK, a program in which the major telecommunications companies shared their traffic with the NSA, and officially confirmed the existence of this signals intelligence agency to the public for the first time.\nBy the early years of the 1970s, a series of troubling reports had appeared in the press concerning U.S. intelligence activities. First came revelations by Army intelligence officer Christopher Pyle in January 1970 regarding the US Army's spying on the civilian population in the United States.[10] Senator Sam Ervin's investigations of military surveillance produced further revelations.[11]\nThen on December 22, 1974, The New York Times published a lengthy front-page article by investigative journalist Seymour Hersh detailing covert activities engaged in by the Central Intelligence Agency under Operation CHAOS to collect information on the political activities of American citizens.[12]\nThe resulting uproar led to the creation of the Church Committee, which was approved by the Senate on January 27, 1975, on a vote of 82 to 4.[13][14]\nThe Church Committee's final report was published in April 1976 in six books. Also published were seven volumes of Church Committee hearings in the Senate.[15]\nBefore the release of the final report, the committee also published an interim report titled \"Alleged Assassination Plots Involving Foreign Leaders\",[16] which investigated alleged attempts to assassinate foreign leaders, including Patrice Lumumba of Zaire, Rafael Trujillo of the Dominican Republic, Ngo Dinh Diem of South Vietnam, Gen. Ren\u00e9 Schneider of Chile, and Fidel Castro of Cuba. President Gerald Ford urged the Senate to withhold the report from the public, but failed,[17] and under recommendations and pressure by the committee, Ford issued Executive Order 11905 (ultimately replaced in 1981 by President Reagan's Executive Order 12333) to ban US sanctioned assassinations of foreign leaders.\nIn addition, the committee produced seven case studies on covert operations, but only the one on Chile was released, titled \"Covert Action in Chile: 1963\u20131973\".[18] The rest were kept secret at CIA's request.[15]\nAccording to a declassified National Security Agency history, the Church Committee also helped to uncover the NSA's Watch List. The information for the list was compiled into the so-called \"Rhyming Dictionary\" of biographical information, which at its peak held millions of names\u2014thousands of which were US citizens. Some prominent members of this list were Joanne Woodward, Thomas Watson, Walter Mondale, Art Buchwald, Arthur F. Burns, Gregory Peck, Otis G. Pike, Tom Wicker, Whitney Young, Howard Baker, Frank Church, David Dellinger, Ralph Abernathy, and others.[19]\nAnother revelation of the committee was the discovery of Operation SHAMROCK, in which the major telecommunications companies shared their traffic with the NSA from 1945 to the early 1970s. The information gathered in this operation fed directly into the Watch List. In 1975, the committee decided to unilaterally declassify the particulars of this operation, against the objections of President Ford's administration.[19]\nTogether, the Church Committee's reports have been said to constitute the most extensive review of intelligence activities ever made available to the public. Much of the contents were classified, but over 50,000 pages were declassified under the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992.\nThe commission also carried out an investigation into the November 22, 1963, assassination of John F. Kennedy, questioning 50 witnesses and accessing 3,000 documents. It focused on the actions of the FBI and CIA, and their support for the Warren Commission.\nThe Church commission raised the question of the possible connection between the plans to assassinate political leaders abroad, particularly in Cuba, and that of the 35th President of the United States.[20]\nThe Church Commission questioned the processes for obtaining information, blaming federal agencies for failing in their duties and responsibilities and concluding that the investigation into the assassination had been deficient.[20]\nIt participated in the creation of the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA), the second major investigation of the JFK assassination, from 1976 to 1979.[21]\nThe Church Co\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Most of them received full pardons, while the sentences of 14 members of the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys were commuted. More than 600 rioters had been convicted of or pleaded guilty to assault of or obstructing law enforcement officers and 170 of using a deadly weapon.[1]\nIn the aftermath of his 2020 presidential election loss to Joe Biden, Trump repeatedly made false claims that widespread electoral fraud had occurred and that only he himself had legitimately won the election. Although most resulting lawsuits were either dismissed or ruled against by numerous courts,[2][3][4] Trump nonetheless conspired with his campaign team to submit documents in several states (all of which had been won by Biden) which falsely claimed to be legitimate electoral certificates for President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.[5] After the submission of these documents, the Trump campaign intended that the presiding officer of the United States Senate, either President of the Senate Pence or President pro tempore Chuck Grassley, would claim to have the unilateral power to reject electors during the January 6, 2021 vote counting session; the presiding officer would reject all electors from the several states in which the Trump campaign had submitted false documents, leaving 232 votes for Trump and 222 votes for Biden, thereby overturning the election results in favor of Trump.[6][7][8] The plans for January 6 failed to come to fruition after Pence refused to follow the campaign's proposals.[9][10]\nTrump nevertheless urged his supporters on January 6, 2021, to march to the Capitol while the joint session of Congress was assembled there to count electoral votes and formalize Biden's victory, culminating with hundreds storming the building and interrupting the electoral vote count.[11]\nBy the end of 2021, 725 people had been charged with federal crimes.[12][13] That number rose to 1,000 by the second anniversary of the attack,[12] to 1,200 by the third anniversary (three-quarters of whom had by then been found guilty)[14][15] and to 1,500 before the fourth anniversary.[16] The Justice Department documented assaults on over 140 police officers and property damage exceeding $2.8 million to the Capitol building and grounds. Approximately 170 defendants had been accused of using deadly or dangerous weapons against law enforcement officers, including fire extinguishers and bear spray.[17]\nThroughout the Biden administration, Trump characterized the January 6 defendants as \"political prisoners\" and \"hostages.\"[17] He promoted a revisionist history of the event by downplaying the severity of the violence and spreading conspiracy theories.[18][19] House Republicans also spread a fringe conspiracy that the FBI orchestrated the attack.[20] On January 29, 2022, when over 760 people had been charged,[12] Trump said at a Texas rally that he would be inclined to pardon the rioters if he were reelected in 2024,[21] which he repeated at a Tennessee rally in June 2022.[22] In November, four days before the midterm elections, he said: \"Let them all go now!\"[23] On May 10, 2023, he said he would be \"inclined to pardon many of them\" while hedging by saying \"a couple of them, probably, they got out of control\".[24] On September 15, 2023, he said in an interview that aired two days later: \"I'm going to look at them, and I certainly might [pardon them] if I think it's appropriate.\"[25]\nThen-representative Adam Schiff, who served on the House committee that investigated the attack and was the lead manager during Trump's first impeachment trial, told MSNBC in February 2022 that Trump's offer of pardons suggested that he \"condoned\" the violence.[26] Representative Pete Aguilar, who was also on the committee, told CNN the same day that he considered Trump's offer to be witness tampering.[27]\nOn December 8, 2024, as president-elect, Trump said in an interview with Kristen Welker on Meet the Press, that he would pardon the rioters on his \"first day\" in office except for any he might deem to be \"radical, crazy.\"[28] Then-vice president elect JD Vance stated that pardons should be given to those who \"protested peacefully\", and not those who did so violently.[29] Vance initially advocated for a blanket pardon in private but thought Trump wouldn't want to do so for political reasons, and was reportedly \"100% behind\" Trump's decision to grant clemency to all rioters.[30] A week following the pardon, Vance told Face the Nation that he and Trump perceived a \"massive denial of due process of liberty\" and that the pardon was the \"right decision\".[31]\nOn January 20, 2025, Trump issued a proclamation titled \"Granting Pardons and Commutation of Sentences for Certain Offenses Relating to the Events at or Near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021\". The proclamation categorized prior criminal proceedings as a \"grave national injustice\" against the American people, and positioned the pardons as beginning a \"process of national reconciliation\".[32] Two inside sources stated that Trump made the decision to give blanket pardons at the \"last minute\" just days before the inauguration,[33] with one advisor saying Trump said \"Fuck it: Release 'em all\".[30]\nCiting Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution of the United States, the proclamation established two distinct categories of clemency for individuals involved in the events at the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021. The first category of clemency consisted of sentence commutations to time served for fourteen named individuals. These commutations applied to prominent figures in the January 6 events, including Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes with members Kelly Meggs a\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

In 1974 Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning journalist Seymour Hersh published a front-page New York Times article claiming that the CIA had been spying on anti-war activists for more than a decade, violating the agency\u2019s charter. Former CIA officials and some lawmakers, including Senators William Proxmire and Stuart Symington, called for a congressional inquiry.\nProcess On January 21, 1975, Senator John Pastore introduced a resolution to establish a select committee to investigate federal intelligence operations and determine \u201cthe extent, if any, to which illegal, improper, or unethical activities were engaged in by any agency of the Federal Government.\u201d The Senate approved the resolution, 82-4.\nMajority Leader Mike Mansfield cautioned the Senate \"against letting the affair become a \u2018television extravaganza.\u2019\u201d He and Republican Leader Hugh Scott carefully selected committee members, balancing experienced lawmakers with junior members and ensuring that members represented a variety of political viewpoints. When Philip Hart declined to lead the committee for health-related reasons, Mansfield selected Democrat Frank Church of Idaho to serve as chairman. A 16-year member of the Committee on Foreign Relations, Church had co-chaired a special committee to critically examine the executive branch\u2019s consolidation of power in the Cold War era. Church recognized the strategic value of the nation\u2019s top intelligence agencies and was also mindful of the need for American institutions to function within the confines of U.S. constitutional law. He had aggressively lobbied to lead the investigation. Republican John Tower of Texas, a member of the Armed Services Committee, was selected as the committee\u2019s vice-chairman.\nPublic Relations The committee decided that most of its hearings would be held in closed, executive session, in order to protect intelligence sources and methods. The committee held a series of public hearings in September and October of 1975 to educate the American public about the \u201cunlawful or improper conduct\u201d of the intelligence community, highlighting a few carefully selected cases of misconduct. These hearings examined a CIA biological agents program, a White House domestic surveillance program, IRS intelligence activities, and the FBI\u2019s program to disrupt the civil rights and anti-Vietnam War movements. These nationally televised events offered the American public an opportunity to learn about the secret operations conducted for decades by U.S. intelligence agencies.\nThough the committee\u2019s work garnered much national attention, it was not without its critics, some of whom dismissed the inquiry as a vehicle for Senator Church\u2019s 1976 presidential bid. (Church declared his candidacy in March 1976.) Others argued that congressional inquiries (the House conducted its own separate investigation) undermined the security and credibility of U.S. intelligence agencies. The assassination of Richard Welch, CIA station chief in Greece, outside his home in Athens on Christmas Day, 1975, diverted the public\u2019s attention from the committee\u2019s focus on intelligence abuses. Church remained resolute in his belief of \u201cthe right of the public to know what the instrumentalities of their Government have done.\u201d\nInvestigation The committee faced a formidable task: to conduct a wide-ranging investigation of the nation\u2019s most secret agencies and programs, and based on those findings, write a detailed report including legislative recommendations. All of this work was to be completed within one year (later extended to 16 months). After a meeting with President Gerald Ford and his top national security advisors, Church and Vice-Chairman Tower secured from the president a pledge that the White House would cooperate with Senate investigators. Staff identified potential programs for study and began requesting documents from intelligence agencies. Though staff did not always receive documents in a timely fashion, they enjoyed unprecedented access to materials that had never before been made public. Perhaps the most well-known of these internal reports, the CIA\u2019s so-called \u201cFamily Jewels,\u201d outlined the agency\u2019s misdeeds dating back to President Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s administration. This report, as well as those found in other agencies, provided road maps that staff investigators used to piece together complicated histories of domestic, foreign, and military intelligence programs during the Cold War era. Even with a peak staff of 150, however, organizing and analyzing these materials proved to be an arduous task.\nDespite these numerous challenges, the Church Committee investigated and identified a wide range of intelligence abuses by federal agencies, including the CIA, FBI, Internal Revenue Service, and National Security Agency. In the course of their work, investigators identified programs that had never before been known to the American public, including NSA\u2019s Projects SHAMROCK and MINARET, programs which monitored wire communications to and from the United States and shared some of that data with other intelligence agencies. Committee staff researched the FBI\u2019s long-running program of \u201ccovert action designed to disrupt and discredit the activities of groups and individuals deemed a threat to\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The violence that played out on Capitol Hill was unacceptable then and ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nOn January 20, 2025, during the first day of his second term, United States president Donald Trump granted blanket clemency to all people, nearly 1,600, convicted of or awaiting trial or sentencing for offenses related to the January 6 United States Capitol attack that occurred near the end of his first presidential term. Most of them received full pardons, while the sentences of 14 members of the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys were commuted. More than 600 rioters had been convicted of or pleaded guilty to assault of or obstructing law enforcement officers and 170 of using a deadly weapon.[1]\nIn the aftermath of his 2020 presidential election loss to Joe Biden, Trump repeatedly made false claims that widespread electoral fraud had occurred and that only he himself had legitimately won the election. Although most resulting lawsuits were either dismissed or ruled against by numerous courts,[2][3][4] Trump nonetheless conspired with his campaign team to submit documents in several states (all of which had been won by Biden) which falsely claimed to be legitimate electoral certificates for President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.[5] After the submission of these documents, the Trump campaign intended that the presiding officer of the United States Senate, either President of the Senate Pence or President pro tempore Chuck Grassley, would claim to have the unilateral power to reject electors during the January 6, 2021 vote counting session; the presiding officer would reject all electors from the several states in which the Trump campaign had submitted false documents, leaving 232 votes for Trump and 222 votes for Biden, thereby overturning the election results in favor of Trump.[6][7][8] The plans for January 6 failed to come to fruition after Pence refused to follow the campaign's proposals.[9][10]\nTrump nevertheless urged his supporters on January 6, 2021, to march to the Capitol while the joint session of Congress was assembled there to count electoral votes and formalize Biden's victory, culminating with hundreds storming the building and interrupting the electoral vote count.[11]\nBy the end of 2021, 725 people had been charged with federal crimes.[12][13] That number rose to 1,000 by the second anniversary of the attack,[12] to 1,200 by the third anniversary (three-quarters of whom had by then been found guilty)[14][15] and to 1,500 before the fourth anniversary.[16] The Justice Department documented assaults on over 140 police officers and property damage exceeding $2.8 million to the Capitol building and grounds. Approximately 170 defendants had been accused of using deadly or dangerous weapons against law enforcement officers, including fire extinguishers and bear spray.[17]\nThroughout the Biden administration, Trump characterized the January 6 defendants as \"political prisoners\" and \"hostages.\"[17] He promoted a revisionist history of the event by downplaying the severity of the violence and spreading conspiracy theories.[18][19] House Republicans also spread a fringe conspiracy that the FBI orchestrated the attack.[20] On January 29, 2022, when over 760 people had been charged,[12] Trump said at a Texas rally that he would be inclined to pardon the rioters if he were reelected in 2024,[21] which he repeated at a Tennessee rally in June 2022.[22] In November, four days before the midterm elections, he said: \"Let them all go now!\"[23] On May 10, 2023, he said he would be \"inclined to pardon many of them\" while hedging by saying \"a couple of them, probably, they got out of control\".[24] On September 15, 2023, he said in an interview that aired two days later: \"I'm going to look at them, and I certainly might [pardon them] if I think it's appropriate.\"[25]\nThen-representative Adam Schiff, who served on the House committee that investigated the attack and was the lead manager during Trump's first impeachment trial, told MSNBC in February 2022 that Trump's offer of pardons suggested that he \"condoned\" the violence.[26] Representative Pete Aguilar, who was also on the committee, told CNN the same day that he considered Trump's offer to be witness tampering.[27]\nOn December 8, 2024, as president-elect, Trump said in an interview with Kristen Welker on Meet the Press, that he would pardon the rioters on his \"first day\" in office except for any he might deem to be \"radical, crazy.\"[28] Then-vice president elect JD Vance stated that pardons should be given to those who \"protested peacefully\", and not those who did so violently.[29] Vance initially advocated for a blanket pardon in private but thought Trump wouldn't want to do so for political reasons, and was reportedly \"100% behind\" Trump's decision to grant clemency to all rioters.[30] A week following the pardon, Vance told Face the Nation that he and Trump perceived a \"massive denial of due process of liberty\" and that the pardon was the \"right decision\".[31]\nOn January 20, 2025, Trump issued a proclamation titled \"Granting Pardons and Commutation of Sentences for Certain Offenses Relating to the Events at or Near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021\". The proclamation categorized prior criminal proceedings as a \"grave national injustice\" against the American people, and positioned the pardons as beginning a \"process of national reconciliation\".[32] Two inside sources stated that Trump made the decision to give blanket pardons at the \"last minute\" just days before the inauguration,[33] with one advisor saying Trump said \"Fuck it: Release 'em all\".[30]\nCiting Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution of the United States, the proclamation established two distinct categories of clemency for individuals involved in the events at the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021. The first category of clemency consisted of sentence commutations to time served for fourteen named individuals. These commutations applied to prominent figures in the January 6 events, including Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes with members Kelly Meggs a\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Most of them received full pardons, while the sentences of 14 members of the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys were commuted. More than 600 rioters had been convicted of or pleaded guilty to assault of or obstructing law enforcement officers and 170 of using a deadly weapon.[1]\nIn the aftermath of his 2020 presidential election loss to Joe Biden, Trump repeatedly made false claims that widespread electoral fraud had occurred and that only he himself had legitimately won the election. Although most resulting lawsuits were either dismissed or ruled against by numerous courts,[2][3][4] Trump nonetheless conspired with his campaign team to submit documents in several states (all of which had been won by Biden) which falsely claimed to be legitimate electoral certificates for President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.[5] After the submission of these documents, the Trump campaign intended that the presiding officer of the United States Senate, either President of the Senate Pence or President pro tempore Chuck Grassley, would claim to have the unilateral power to reject electors during the January 6, 2021 vote counting session; the presiding officer would reject all electors from the several states in which the Trump campaign had submitted false documents, leaving 232 votes for Trump and 222 votes for Biden, thereby overturning the election results in favor of Trump.[6][7][8] The plans for January 6 failed to come to fruition after Pence refused to follow the campaign's proposals.[9][10]\nTrump nevertheless urged his supporters on January 6, 2021, to march to the Capitol while the joint session of Congress was assembled there to count electoral votes and formalize Biden's victory, culminating with hundreds storming the building and interrupting the electoral vote count.[11]\nBy the end of 2021, 725 people had been charged with federal crimes.[12][13] That number rose to 1,000 by the second anniversary of the attack,[12] to 1,200 by the third anniversary (three-quarters of whom had by then been found guilty)[14][15] and to 1,500 before the fourth anniversary.[16] The Justice Department documented assaults on over 140 police officers and property damage exceeding $2.8 million to the Capitol building and grounds. Approximately 170 defendants had been accused of using deadly or dangerous weapons against law enforcement officers, including fire extinguishers and bear spray.[17]\nThroughout the Biden administration, Trump characterized the January 6 defendants as \"political prisoners\" and \"hostages.\"[17] He promoted a revisionist history of the event by downplaying the severity of the violence and spreading conspiracy theories.[18][19] House Republicans also spread a fringe conspiracy that the FBI orchestrated the attack.[20] On January 29, 2022, when over 760 people had been charged,[12] Trump said at a Texas rally that he would be inclined to pardon the rioters if he were reelected in 2024,[21] which he repeated at a Tennessee rally in June 2022.[22] In November, four days before the midterm elections, he said: \"Let them all go now!\"[23] On May 10, 2023, he said he would be \"inclined to pardon many of them\" while hedging by saying \"a couple of them, probably, they got out of control\".[24] On September 15, 2023, he said in an interview that aired two days later: \"I'm going to look at them, and I certainly might [pardon them] if I think it's appropriate.\"[25]\nThen-representative Adam Schiff, who served on the House committee that investigated the attack and was the lead manager during Trump's first impeachment trial, told MSNBC in February 2022 that Trump's offer of pardons suggested that he \"condoned\" the violence.[26] Representative Pete Aguilar, who was also on the committee, told CNN the same day that he considered Trump's offer to be witness tampering.[27]\nOn December 8, 2024, as president-elect, Trump said in an interview with Kristen Welker on Meet the Press, that he would pardon the rioters on his \"first day\" in office except for any he might deem to be \"radical, crazy.\"[28] Then-vice president elect JD Vance stated that pardons should be given to those who \"protested peacefully\", and not those who did so violently.[29] Vance initially advocated for a blanket pardon in private but thought Trump wouldn't want to do so for political reasons, and was reportedly \"100% behind\" Trump's decision to grant clemency to all rioters.[30] A week following the pardon, Vance told Face the Nation that he and Trump perceived a \"massive denial of due process of liberty\" and that the pardon was the \"right decision\".[31]\nOn January 20, 2025, Trump issued a proclamation titled \"Granting Pardons and Commutation of Sentences for Certain Offenses Relating to the Events at or Near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021\". The proclamation categorized prior criminal proceedings as a \"grave national injustice\" against the American people, and positioned the pardons as beginning a \"process of national reconciliation\".[32] Two inside sources stated that Trump made the decision to give blanket pardons at the \"last minute\" just days before the inauguration,[33] with one advisor saying Trump said \"Fuck it: Release 'em all\".[30]\nCiting Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution of the United States, the proclamation established two distinct categories of clemency for individuals involved in the events at the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021.

Although most resulting lawsuits were either dismissed or ruled against by numerous courts,[2][3][4] Trump nonetheless conspired with his campaign team to submit documents in several states (all of which had been won by Biden) which falsely claimed to be legitimate electoral certificates for President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.[5] After the submission of these documents, the Trump campaign intended that the presiding officer of the United States Senate, either President of the Senate Pence or President pro tempore Chuck Grassley, would claim to have the unilateral power to reject electors during the January 6, 2021 vote counting session; the presiding officer would reject all electors from the several states in which the Trump campaign had submitted false documents, leaving 232 votes for Trump and 222 votes for Biden, thereby overturning the election results in favor of Trump.[6][7][8] The plans for January 6 failed to come to fruition after Pence refused to follow the campaign's proposals.[9][10]\nTrump nevertheless urged his supporters on January 6, 2021, to march to the Capitol while the joint session of Congress was assembled there to count electoral votes and formalize Biden's victory, culminating with hundreds storming the building and interrupting the electoral vote count.[11]\nBy the end of 2021, 725 people had been charged with federal crimes.[12][13] That number rose to 1,000 by the second anniversary of the attack,[12] to 1,200 by the third anniversary (three-quarters of whom had by then been found guilty)[14][15] and to 1,500 before the fourth anniversary.[16] The Justice Department documented assaults on over 140 police officers and property damage exceeding $2.8 million to the Capitol building and grounds. Approximately 170 defendants had been accused of using deadly or dangerous weapons against law enforcement officers, including fire extinguishers and bear spray.[17]\nThroughout the Biden administration, Trump characterized the January 6 defendants as \"political prisoners\" and \"hostages.\"[17] He promoted a revisionist history of the event by downplaying the severity of the violence and spreading conspiracy theories.[18][19] House Republicans also spread a fringe conspiracy that the FBI orchestrated the attack.[20] On January 29, 2022, when over 760 people had been charged,[12] Trump said at a Texas rally that he would be inclined to pardon the rioters if he were reelected in 2024,[21] which he repeated at a Tennessee rally in June 2022.[22] In November, four days before the midterm elections, he said: \"Let them all go now!\"[23] On May 10, 2023, he said he would be \"inclined to pardon many of them\" while hedging by saying \"a couple of them, probably, they got out of control\".[24] On September 15, 2023, he said in an interview that aired two days later: \"I'm going to look at them, and I certainly might [pardon them] if I think it's appropriate.\"[25]\nThen-representative Adam Schiff, who served on the House committee that investigated the attack and was the lead manager during Trump's first impeachment trial, told MSNBC in February 2022 that Trump's offer of pardons suggested that he \"condoned\" the violence.[26] Representative Pete Aguilar, who was also on the committee, told CNN the same day that he considered Trump's offer to be witness tampering.[27]\nOn December 8, 2024, as president-elect, Trump said in an interview with Kristen Welker on Meet the Press, that he would pardon the rioters on his \"first day\" in office except for any he might deem to be \"radical, crazy.\"[28] Then-vice president elect JD Vance stated that pardons should be given to those who \"protested peacefully\", and not those who did so violently.[29] Vance initially advocated for a blanket pardon in private but thought Trump wouldn't want to do so for political reasons, and was reportedly \"100% behind\" Trump's decision to grant clemency to all rioters.[30] A week following the pardon, Vance told Face the Nation that he and Trump perceived a \"massive denial of due process of liberty\" and that the pardon was the \"right decision\".[31]\nOn January 20, 2025, Trump issued a proclamation titled \"Granting Pardons and Commutation of Sentences for Certain Offenses Relating to the Events at or Near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021\". The proclamation categorized prior criminal proceedings as a \"grave national injustice\" against the American people, and positioned the pardons as beginning a \"process of national reconciliation\".[32] Two inside sources stated that Trump made the decision to give blanket pardons at the \"last minute\" just days before the inauguration,[33] with one advisor saying Trump said \"Fuck it: Release 'em all\".[30]\nCiting Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution of the United States, the proclamation established two distinct categories of clemency for individuals involved in the events at the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021. The first category of clemency consisted of sentence commutations to time served for fourteen named individuals. These commutations applied to prominent figures in the January 6 events, including Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes with members Kelly Meggs a\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This was politicized intelligence that was used as the basis for countless smears seeking to delegitimize President Trump\u2019s victory, the years-long Mueller investigation, two Congressional impeachments, high level officials being investigated, arrested, and thrown in jail, heightened US-Russia tensions, and more.\n\u201cThe issue I am raising is not a partisan issue. It is one that concerns every American. The information we are releasing today clearly shows there was a treasonous conspiracy in 2016 committed by officials at the highest level of our government. Their goal was to subvert the will of the American people and enact what was essentially a years-long coup with the objective of trying to usurp the President from fulfilling the mandate bestowed upon him by the American people,\u201d said DNI Tulsi Gabbard. \u201cTheir egregious abuse of power and blatant rejection of our Constitution threatens the very foundation and integrity of our democratic republic. No matter how powerful, every person involved in this conspiracy must be investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, to ensure nothing like this ever happens again. The American people\u2019s faith and trust in our democratic republic and therefore the future of our nation depends on it. As such, I am providing all documents to the Department of Justice to deliver the accountability that President Trump, his family, and the American people deserve.\u201d\nThe files and a memo on today\u2019s release are available on DNI.gov.

Introduction and Scope.\nProtecting our national security is the Department's top priority. National security encompasses the national defense, foreign intelligence and counterintelligence, international and internal security, and foreign relations. This includes countering terrorism; combating espionage and economic espionage conducted for the benefit of any foreign government, foreign instrumentality, or foreign agent; enforcing export controls and sanctions; and disrupting cyber threats that are perpetrated by nation states, terrorists, or their agents or proxies.\nWhen national security issues arise during a criminal prosecution, they must be resolved through careful coordination by the Department of Justice (Department) with high level officials from the intelligence, military and foreign affairs communities. In addition, the Attorney General, or the Attorney General's designee, has certain statutory authority and obligations related to national security prosecutions.That authority and those obligations may be properly exercised and met only with appropriate coordination within the Department by the respective United States Attorneys' Offices (USAOs).\nThis chapter applies to national security matters other than counterterrorism matters; counterterrorism matters are covered principally by JM 9-2.136 et seq. In addition, this chapter does not apply when a matter's sole nexus to national security is foreign relations (e.g., international extradition; indictment of a high ranking foreign official for a non\u00ad national security crime; and other treaty-related issues). Coordination of such matters will be handled by the Criminal Division, Office of International Affairs (OIA). See JM 9-2.400 for circumstances requiring prior consultation with or approval from OIA.\nPrior approval, consultation and notification requirements related to national security can be found in JM 9-90.020, below.\nB. Authority to Conduct Prosecutions Relating to the National Security.\nThe enforcement of all criminal laws affecting, involving or relating to the national security, and the responsibility for prosecuting criminal offenses, such as conspiracy, perjury and false statements, arising out of offenses related to national security, is assigned to the Assistant Attorney General (AAG) of the National Security Division. Where a matter affects the national security, regardless of the specific statute(s) implicated, prosecutions shall be instituted and conducted under the supervision of the Assistant Attorney General, National Security Division, or higher authority. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 0.72.\nThe Counterintelligence and Export Control Section (CES) of the National Security Division, under the supervision of the AAG or a higher authority, conducts, handles, and supervises prosecutions within the scope of this chapter.\n[updated March 2016]\nOther Matters that Affect the National Security\nA variety of other Federal statutes may also be used to prevent, disrupt, and prosecute national security threats. Thus, prosecutions pursuant to criminal statutes other than those set forth in 9-90.020(A)(1) may also affect national security (e.g., a case involving wire fraud or hacking by or on behalf of a foreign government in which 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1831 or 18 U.S.C.\u00a7 1030(a)(1) are not specifically included as charges).\nIf a particular matter affects the national security, or if there is a reasonable question about whether a particular matter affects the national security, the USAO shall consult with CES to discuss how the matter should be treated. If the USAO is coordinating with another component of Main Justice, the USAO shall consult directly with CES unless the other component of Main Justice has agreed to facilitate this required consultation.\nConsultation and Approval Requirements. Prosecution of a case involving a national security statute set forth in 9-90.020(A)(1) shall not be instituted without the express approval of the National Security Division or higher authority. In addition, in such cases, CES shall be consulted before:\nIn any other prosecution that affects the national security, regardless of the specific statute(s) implicated, or if there is a reasonable question about whether a particular matter affects the national security, the USAO shall consult with CES to discuss how the matter should be treated and whether the above prior approval or consultation requirements should apply. If the USAO is coordinating with another component of Main Justice, the USAO shall consult directly with CES unless the other component of Main Justice has agreed to facilitate this required consultation.\nConsultation with CES is also required in all cases in which classified information plays a role in the prosecutive decision, and all cases that require the protections afforded by the Classified Information Procedures Act, 18 U.S.C. app. 3, i.e., cases in which classified information may be disclosed during the pretrial, trial or appellate stage of the litigation.\nFinally, before initiating a prosecution under 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441e, Campaign Contributions by Foreign Nationals, the Registration Unit of CES, (202) 233-0986, shall be consulted.\n[cited in JM 9-2.111; JM 9-90.010; JM 9-90.300; JM 9-90.400; JM 9-90.500; JM 9-90.550; JM 9-90.600; JM 9-90.610; JM 9-90.620; JM 9-90.640; JM 9-90.700; JM 9-90.720]\n[updated December 2020]\nEach United States Attorney\u2019s Office (USAO) shall designate one or more AUSAs as the district\u2019s National Security Cyber Specialist (NSCS).

This was politicized intelligence that was used as the basis for countless smears seeking to delegitimize President Trump\u2019s victory, the years-long Mueller investigation, two Congressional impeachments, high level officials being investigated, arrested, and thrown in jail, heightened US-Russia tensions, and more.\n\u201cThe issue I am raising is not a partisan issue. It is one that concerns every American. The information we are releasing today clearly shows there was a treasonous conspiracy in 2016 committed by officials at the highest level of our government. Their goal was to subvert the will of the American people and enact what was essentially a years-long coup with the objective of trying to usurp the President from fulfilling the mandate bestowed upon him by the American people,\u201d said DNI Tulsi Gabbard. \u201cTheir egregious abuse of power and blatant rejection of our Constitution threatens the very foundation and integrity of our democratic republic. No matter how powerful, every person involved in this conspiracy must be investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, to ensure nothing like this ever happens again. The American people\u2019s faith and trust in our democratic republic and therefore the future of our nation depends on it.
