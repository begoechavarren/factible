    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nThe nation's historical preservation group, is now suing the Trump administration over its plans to build a giant ballroom over at the white House. Back in October, the Trump administration quickly demolished the white House East Wing to make room for the ballroom for this project. Want to bring in CNN's Brian Todd? Brian, why is the National Trust taking this dramatic step? And this is a lengthy lawsuit. It's a lengthy lawsuit, Wolf, 47 pages. It was filed just moments ago. We have a copy of this lawsuit now to answer your question, Wolf. They are suing because they want this project halted, first and foremost. And they're suing because they said that the white House and its allies and in certain agencies like the National Park Service, did not get the necessary approvals or conduct the necessary reviews. We have a copy of this lawsuit. You see the pictures here. This has been what many people have been complaining about, the demolition of the East wing of the white House that began in October for the construction of a 90,000 square foot ballroom. And just moments ago, as Wolf mentioned, we've obtained a copy of this lawsuit from the National Trust for Historic Preservation. They are suing the National Park Service. They are suing President Trump himself, plus the National Park Service, plus the Department of the Interior and Interior Secretary Douglas Burgum, and others over the construction of the ballroom where the east wing and the colonnade used to be. And here is just one quote from one of the initial pages of the lawsuit. No president is legally allowed to tear down portions of the white House without any review whatsoever. Not President Trump, not President Biden, and not anyone else. And no president is legally allowed to construct a ballroom on public property without giving the public the opportunity to weigh in. President Trump's efforts to do so should be immediately halted, and work on the ballroom project should be paused until the defendants complete the required reviews. Reviews that should have taken place before the defendants demolish the East Wing and before they began construction of the ballroom and secured the necessary approvals. What they are also saying is that there are two entities, from which the white House needed to seek approval and at least a review of this project. The National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts. And according to this lawsuit from the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the white House did not seek any review from those agencies and did not seek any, public, input on this project. Now, I can I can tell you also, Wolf, we are reaching out to the white House for comment. Our colleague Kevin Liptak is handling that right now. We should be able to get that from Kevin in just a moment. But what I will say is that the president has had this in his, in his sights to to renovate this area, to do a ballroom for years, not just months, years, including before he came into office. He said he offered the Obama administration, you know, that he said he would pay for it. The Obama administration, he said, never got back to him. President Trump has said many times that he believes this is necessary, that people who come to the white House, for certain events, they have to go to a tent that's kind of separate from the main, main body of the white House. And in bad weather, a lot of people who are here for balls and things like that, they just get kind of, disheveled, having to walk through the rain and get into a tent. That's been his perspective. He's been eyeing this for a long time. His idea is to make this very much like the Donald Trump Ballroom at Mar-A-Lago. It's going to look a lot like that. And there are plenty of other ballrooms that I've been to, many of them. Right near the white House, huge ballrooms that they could go to, not just a. I've been to the tent on the backyard of the white House on this, on this on the North Lawn of the white House, and the South Lawn of the white House as well. And that east wing was beautiful. And too bad it's been destroyed. Ari. Brian, thank you very, very much. Kevin Liptak is over at the white House right now. This has been a huge priority for the president. And as Brian just said, you're working to get some reaction. Are you learning anything? Yeah. The white House hasn't responded to this lawsuit specifically, but I'll tell you that white House officials have sort of downplayed criticism from this particular group, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which you'll remember back in October as this project was getting underway, actually wrote a letter to the white House asking them to pause work to, go through some of these various boards for review. And the white House said at the time that this, trust, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, was comprised of, quote, loser Democrats and liberal donors. And so you see them kind of shrugging off the criticism, we should say that this body is chartered by Congress, tasked with, preserving some of the nation's historic buildings. It actually does have a relationship with President Trump dating back to the 1990s. It worked with him on some projects at Mar-A-Lago. So he does have sort of an existing relationship with this, body, going back several decades. We should say that, the boards that this, group is now requesting and demanding that the court, require that the administration go through the National Capital Planning Commission is now stacked with President Trump's appointees. It's led by Will Scharf, who's the staff secretary at the white House. He has said previously that this project will eventually go before that body, but that it's purview and that its remit does not cover demolition. And that is why they say this project didn't go before that board, before they began tearing down the East wing, but that once sort of vertical construction begins, that it will go before that body. And so, whether this lawsuit sort of spurs that action and prompts them to go more quickly remains to be seen. But you're right. This is an absolute priority of the president. He still mentions that, on almost a weekly basis, you know, when, the crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was here, for example, the president said, that the dinner he held in his honor on the white House state floor would have been a much grander occasion if they had had, that ballroom constructed in his honor. We should also say that there has been some, discord among the planning team. You know, the president has assigned a new architect, the previous architect still on board, but he had reportedly raised some questions about the sheer scale of this project. You know, the president is envisioning a 90,000 square foot ballroom. The white House itself is only about 55,000ft\u00b2. And one of the concerns that the National Trust for Historic Preservation has raised is that they would essentially dwarf the original building once it's completed. And so all of these concerns are now due to be, heard in court, Wolf, the president keeps pointing out that, this ballroom will be paid for by private donations, not taxpayers. Is that a factor here? It could be. And I think, you know, the president and the white House have said that they will be transparent and they have released, some of the names of the donors who will contribute to this project. One of the questions is how potentially they'll be honored as part of it, whether their names will be, written on the wall or whether they'll have sort of plaques, in the final, ballroom to designate who who donated and, what sort of contribution they were able to make to this project. But it has raised a certainly questions about what kind of influence those donors, might have with the white House and whether or not these individuals are essentially using these donations to curry favor with the president, recognizing that this is a major priority of his. All right. Kevin Liptak at the white House for us, Kevin, thank you very, very much.",

The floor area is about 55,000 square feet.\n\nFull Page Content:\nThe White House is the name given to the official residence and workplace of the President of the United States. Since it is typically associated with the President, it is also a symbol of the executive branch of the U.S. Government, and every President except George Washington has lived here. It is located at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, DC, and is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the country. The White House is about one mile north of the Washington Monument and about two miles northwest of the U.S. Capitol Building.\nThe White House was built between 1792 and 1800; in 1814, it was burned by the British army when they invaded the city during the War of 1812. After the war ended, the White House was rebuilt in the 1820s and has been expanded over the years, including major internal reconstruction from 1949 to 1951. It has been redecorated on the inside and today is open for public tours. The President\u2019s family also lives in the White House, and although each President may make changes to the interior, these must be approved by the Committee for the Preservation of the White House. Any changes must be in keeping with the historical character of the White House.\nThe President\u2019s office is called the Oval Office because the room is shaped like an oval. In the Oval Office, the President signs bills, meets with staff, and hosts guests and visitors. One of the most famous pieces of furniture in the room is the Resolute desk, which was made from the wood of a British ship and was given to President Hayes in 1880 by Queen Victoria.\nThe White House and its grounds have seen many changes. During World War I, President Woodrow Wilson had a flock of sheep on the south grounds that ate the grass; their wool was sold for the war effort. The South Lawn is also where the President\u2019s helicopter, Marine One, takes off and lands. It is the site of the annual Easter Egg Roll, where children can participate in a traditional Easter event. The grounds have also been used as gardens for food for the White House meals.\nWhite House facts and figures:\nTo learn more, including an interactive tour, see the White House official site.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

On July 31, 2025, the White House issued a statement that a 90,000 sq. ft. addition will be made to the White House to incorporate a 650-person capacity ballroom.1 The project is set to begin in September 2025 and planned to be completed \u201clong before\u201d the end of the President\u2019s term in 2029.2 Funded privately by the President and other unspecified donors, the approximately $200 million dollar project involves a major expansion of the East Wing of the White House.3\nAs the leading scholarly organization for architectural historians in North America, SAH limits its advocacy to matters of national and international import. We assess such issues with rigor and deliberation, and do not speak without due consideration of a site\u2019s architectural and cultural significance. The White House is one of the most important historic buildings in the United States. As stated in the \u2018Design Guidelines for the White House and President\u2019s Park\u2019 (1997), issued by the National Park Service: \u201cThe White House and President\u2019s Park are first and foremost a public trust, an important part of our national heritage.\u201d 4\nWhile we recognize that the White House is a building with evolving needs, and that it has undergone various exterior and interior modifications since construction began in 1792, the proposed ballroom will be the first major change to its exterior appearance in the last 83 years (since the East Wing in its current form was built in 1942). Therefore, such a significant change to a historic building of this import should follow a rigorous and deliberate design and review process. Since the project announcement, the American Institute of Architects (AIA) has expressed concern and offered recommendations in five areas: establishing a qualifications-based architect selection process, enacting a rigorous historic preservation review, prioritizing transparency and public accountability, considering \u201cproportionality\u201d and \u201cdesign harmony\u201d, and leveraging collaboration and expertise across the architecture profession.5 We share the AIA\u2019s concern and support their recommendations, while offering the following additional items for consideration:\nSincerely, SAH Heritage Conservation Committee Priya Jain, AIA (Chair) Fallon Aidoo, Ph.D. Kenneth Breisch, Ph.D. Pushpita Eshika, Ph.D. Yannick Etoundi Bryan Clark Green, Ph.D. Ba\u015fak Kalfa, Ph.D. Mary Rzepczynski Mohammad Gharipour, Ph.D. (ex-officio member) Ben Thomas, Ph.D. (ex-officio member) Approved September 16, 2025.\n*This statement was revised on October 23 to remove a reference to an incorrectly attributed quote in a report by The Associated Press.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 1 \u201cThe White House Announces White House Ballroom Construction to Begin,\u201d The White House, July 31, 2025. https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/07/the-white-house-announces-white-house-ballroom-construction-to-begin/ 2 Ibid. 3 Ibid. 4 US Department of the Interior, National Park Service, Design Guidelines: The White House and President\u2019s Park, Washington D.C., December 1997, 7. https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/prpa/prpa_design_guidelines.pdf 5 \u201cAIA Advocates for Preservation and Transparency in Proposed $200 million White House Expansion,\u201d American Institute of Architects, August 5, 2025. https://www.aia.org/about-aia/press/aia-advocates-preservation-and-transparency-proposed-200-million-white-house 6 Will Scharf, Chair of the National Planning Commission, as quoted in Elizabeth Crisp, \u201cWhite House Ballroom Demolition Doesn\u2019t Need Approval: Trump-Appointed Panel Chief,\u201d The Hill, September 5, 2025. https://thehill.com/homenews/5488638-trump-ballroom-demolition-no-approval/ 7 President Donald Trump as quoted in Peter Nicholas, \u201cTrump Says the New White House Ballroom Will be \u2018a Little Bigger\u2019 Than Initially Planned,\u201d NBC News, September 13, 2025. https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-white-house-ballroom-bigger-rcna231033\nCover photo: The White House from Washington, DC, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\nSAH thanks the Richard H.

Read the statement here.\nOctober 21, 2025\nMr. William Scharf, Chair National Capital Planning Commission 401 Ninth Street NW, Suite 500N Washington, DC 20004\nMs. Jessica Bowron Acting Director, National Park Service National Park Service 1849 C Street NW Washington, DC 20240\nMs. Billie Tsien, Chair Commission of Fine Arts 401 F Street NW, Suite 312 Washington, DC 20001-2728\nRe: Proposed Construction of White House Ballroom\nMr. Scharf, Ms. Bowron, and Ms. Tsien,\nThe National Trust for Historic Preservation in the United States (\u201cNational Trust\u201d) is a private charitable, educational, nonprofit corporation headquartered in Washington, D.C. and chartered by Congress in 1949 to further the historic preservation policy of the United States. 54 U.S.C. \u00a7 312102(a). This Congressional charter obligates the National Trust to \u201cfacilitate public participation in the preservation of sites, buildings, and objects of national significance or interest.\u201d Our mission is to protect America\u2019s significant historic sites and to advocate for historic preservation as a core public value.\nPresident Trump has proposed the construction of a 90,000-square-foot ballroom on the east side of the White House campus, adjacent to the historic Treasury Building. Site preparation is already underway, including the demolition of a portion of the existing East Wing.\nWhile the National Trust acknowledges the utility of a larger meeting space at the White House, we are deeply concerned that the massing and height of the proposed new construction will overwhelm the White House itself\u2014it is 55,000 square feet\u2014and may also permanently disrupt the carefully balanced classical design of the White House with its two smaller, and lower, East and West Wings. The federally recognized Secretary of the Interior\u2019s Standards for Rehabilitation offer clear guidance for construction projects affecting historic properties. The Standards provide that new additions should not destroy the historic fabric of the property and that the new work should be compatible with existing massing, size, scale, and architectural features.\nOwned by the American people, the White House was designed by Irish architect James Hoban, whose winning proposal was selected by President George Washington. The building respects Georgian and neoclassical principles. It is a National Historic Landmark, a National Park, and a globally recognized symbol of our nation\u2019s ideals.\nWe respectfully urge the Administration and the National Park Service to pause demolition until plans for the proposed ballroom go through the legally required public review processes, including consultation and review by the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts, and to invite comment from the public. These processes provide a crucial opportunity for transparency and broad engagement\u2014values that have guided preservation of the White House under every administration going back to the public competition in 1792 that produced the building\u2019s original design. Doing so will help ensure that the project both honors the exceptional historic significance of the White House and acknowledges the investment that the American people have in the preservation of this beloved place.\nThe National Trust stands ready to assist the White House, the National Park Service, and relevant review agencies in exploring design alternatives and modifications that would accomplish the objectives of the Administration while preserving the historic integrity and symbolism of the People\u2019s House.\nAs we approach the 250th Anniversary of our country\u2019s founding, the preservation of historic places that represent our nation\u2019s history has never been more relevant or important. We urge you to take into account the deep reverence that all Americans hold for this iconic place, and to initiate the review process that can ensure the preservation of the historic White House for future generations.\nSincerely,\nDr. Carol Quillen President and Chief Executive Officer\nCarol Quillen is the 10th President and Chief Executive Officer of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.\nRelated Stories\nNow is the time for preservation advocates to engage directly with your members of Congress and elevate the importance of historic preservation in your communities.\n600 14th Street NW Suite 500 Washington, DC 20005\ninfo@savingplaces.org\n\u00a9 2025 National Trust for Historic Preservation.
