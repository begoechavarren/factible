      "text": "7.1 billion people on this planet are completely in the dark The Continuous and escalating extreme weather events occurring every day around the planet are blamed on mother nature but nothing could be further from the [Music] truth all that is required to understand explain and demonstrate how Decades of global geoengineering development is directly and deliberately responsible for all of the Super Storms hurricanes tornadoes and floods is the understanding of a few simple [Music] Concepts however to find un altered explanations of these Concepts we must first travel back 60 years [Music] rain rain go away come again some other day two young fellas want to play one is Fred he lives in this Farm the other is Pete he lives in the city he's visiting [Music] friend boy where does all this rain come from from the sky everybody knows that [Music] but what Pete really wants to know is how does the water get into the sky well let's see Fred sees one way as the water dries off the horses it goes into the air but there are lots of other ways when the sun comes out strongly after a shower we can almost see the water disappearing into the air [Music] here heat from the Sun is drying the roof water at the top edge of the puddle slowly disappears into the air right before our eyes billions of gallons of water go into the air every hour from the ponds lakes rivers and oceans all over the world in fact everything that dries as giving water to the air even wet Fields do [Music] this and wet clothes on a line slowly lose water to the air and become [Music] dry whether you can see it or whether you can't water is always going into the air from many things even dogs give water to the air as they pant [Music] people as well as animals have to replace the water their bodies give off to the [Music] air yep there's another way water can get into the air the water on the doghouse roof dried pretty fast in the warm sun this this water disappears faster because the stove is hotter this change from water we can see to water vapor we can't see is called [Music] evaporation no that's not evaporation that water isn't changing to water vapor it's just sinking into the soil evaporation comes later the leaves give off water to the air water taken up of the plant's Roots it's hard to believe so let's find out if it's true first a cardboard disc to cover the wet soil then a jar to keep any water vapor from the leaves from being lost to the air and the jar without a [Music] plan and last time until tomorrow [Music] morning during the night the plant gave off water because the jar without the plant is dry inside the jar are droplets just like the droplets that form in the moisture from Fred's warm breath hits the window glass the water vapor changes into very small drops of water because the window is cold in the same way the water vapor from the plant changed to water when it touched the cooler surface of the jar but what happens if the glass is warm the best way to answer such a question is to try [Music] it first a glass is [Music] warm then another glass is chilled [Music] what happens with the warm glass nothing but soon on the cold glass glass water collects water from the air when this happens it's called condensation condensation causes dew on the grass during the night when the earth and grass is cooler than the air condensation takes place and the water vapor forms little drops of water the cloud from the spot of the teac kettle is condensation of the water vapor from the teac kettle hitting the colder air the water vapor in the warm air of the room forms a cloud as it hits the very cold air from the refrigerator [Music] uh-oh now what's going to happen [Music] condensation rain [Music] the hot water in the kettle gives off water vapor to the air by rapid evaporation just as rivers lakes and ponds give off water vapor to the air by slow evaporation as the hot water-filled air hits the colder air near the ice tray the water vapor turns into clouds of tiny water droplets floating in the air condensation when the air is quite cold and cannot hold any more water droplets they collect together to form larger drops as on the ice tray and being too heavy to float in the air they fall back to the Earth as [Music] rain without water in the air we couldn't live our Fields would be dry and nothing would grow because water evaporates in the air and returns again as rain we have water running through the valleys in our Brooks and streams filling reservoirs with water to drink turning our water wheels and turning the turbines and the powerhouses to give us electricity all from water in the air the fundamentals of global geoengineering are no different than this child's experiment water vapor is artificially introduced into the air in place of the natural evaporation stage and is artificially cooled and condensed to produce [Music] rain you need a great many tea kettal to produce the massive amounts of water vapor required to fuel these Global storm systems and this planet is deliberately covered with them [Music] [Music] this artificial precipitation generation is easy to see on infrared satellite and is identified by sudden coordinated bursts of superheated water vapor from no natural source [Music] [Music] ironically the same primary source of CO2 Emissions on this planet is the same source of artificial [Music] precipitation this Nationwide artificial precipitation generation site clickers like clockwork every single day [Music] hexagonal Center of Vortex with flat size proves geoengineering manufacturer nightly Nationwide coordinated artificial precipitation generation Noti is the total absence of natural precipitation before the nightly generation cycle [Music] manufactured vortex in exactly the same area rotating in the opposite direction twin vortices rotating in opposite directions Drive artificial precipitation to the southeast [Music] [Music] [Music] the same identifying cycle of circular and sudden coordinated bursts of artificial precipitation can be seen all around the world in every industrialized and colonized country [Music] in [Music] [Music] [Music] this man-made Global artificial precipitation cycle is the singular reason for massive and continuous flooding worldwide at least nine states with flash flood watches Coast to Coast tonight in Newton North Carolina look at this the water suddenly Rising above the windows of this family's home you can barely see the tops of their cars there and this roadway washed away a giant collapse under the rains today this as we get new information tonight on those two tropical systems big changes there as well we get to it all beginning with the flooding and the pictures just now coming in here's ABC meteorologist Ginger Z tonight chest deep Rescuers pulling people to Safety in Western North Carolina at least 10 Swiftwater rescues already today thanks I just it was raining so hard I did not see like any of that a state of emergency declared in cataba County more than a foot of rain in less than 24 hours busting storm drains and swallowing street signs and mailboxes it's bad it come up fast since 9:00 it probably come up 3T from the drowning Southeast to the wild Southwest that is Albuquerque New Mexico just yesterday near 90 m per hour wind gust sliced through the typically tranquil Town pour down like like a hurricane people plucked from their flooded cars the desert rains swamping the streets near Tucson Arizona the millions of tons of heavy metal nanen trails and frequency activated ice nucleation used to control these storm systems is a topic for another [Music] video however don't believe that mother nature monsoons in the United States or any other fairy tale is responsible for worldwide man-made flooding that you can't see with your own eyes look up",
