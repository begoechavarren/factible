    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\n7.1 billion people on this planet are completely in the dark The Continuous and escalating extreme weather events occurring every day around the planet are blamed on mother nature but nothing could be further from the [Music] truth all that is required to understand explain and demonstrate how Decades of global geoengineering development is directly and deliberately responsible for all of the Super Storms hurricanes tornadoes and floods is the understanding of a few simple [Music] Concepts however to find un altered explanations of these Concepts we must first travel back 60 years [Music] rain rain go away come again some other day two young fellas want to play one is Fred he lives in this Farm the other is Pete he lives in the city he's visiting [Music] friend boy where does all this rain come from from the sky everybody knows that [Music] but what Pete really wants to know is how does the water get into the sky well let's see Fred sees one way as the water dries off the horses it goes into the air but there are lots of other ways when the sun comes out strongly after a shower we can almost see the water disappearing into the air [Music] here heat from the Sun is drying the roof water at the top edge of the puddle slowly disappears into the air right before our eyes billions of gallons of water go into the air every hour from the ponds lakes rivers and oceans all over the world in fact everything that dries as giving water to the air even wet Fields do [Music] this and wet clothes on a line slowly lose water to the air and become [Music] dry whether you can see it or whether you can't water is always going into the air from many things even dogs give water to the air as they pant [Music] people as well as animals have to replace the water their bodies give off to the [Music] air yep there's another way water can get into the air the water on the doghouse roof dried pretty fast in the warm sun this this water disappears faster because the stove is hotter this change from water we can see to water vapor we can't see is called [Music] evaporation no that's not evaporation that water isn't changing to water vapor it's just sinking into the soil evaporation comes later the leaves give off water to the air water taken up of the plant's Roots it's hard to believe so let's find out if it's true first a cardboard disc to cover the wet soil then a jar to keep any water vapor from the leaves from being lost to the air and the jar without a [Music] plan and last time until tomorrow [Music] morning during the night the plant gave off water because the jar without the plant is dry inside the jar are droplets just like the droplets that form in the moisture from Fred's warm breath hits the window glass the water vapor changes into very small drops of water because the window is cold in the same way the water vapor from the plant changed to water when it touched the cooler surface of the jar but what happens if the glass is warm the best way to answer such a question is to try [Music] it first a glass is [Music] warm then another glass is chilled [Music] what happens with the warm glass nothing but soon on the cold glass glass water collects water from the air when this happens it's called condensation condensation causes dew on the grass during the night when the earth and grass is cooler than the air condensation takes place and the water vapor forms little drops of water the cloud from the spot of the teac kettle is condensation of the water vapor from the teac kettle hitting the colder air the water vapor in the warm air of the room forms a cloud as it hits the very cold air from the refrigerator [Music] uh-oh now what's going to happen [Music] condensation rain [Music] the hot water in the kettle gives off water vapor to the air by rapid evaporation just as rivers lakes and ponds give off water vapor to the air by slow evaporation as the hot water-filled air hits the colder air near the ice tray the water vapor turns into clouds of tiny water droplets floating in the air condensation when the air is quite cold and cannot hold any more water droplets they collect together to form larger drops as on the ice tray and being too heavy to float in the air they fall back to the Earth as [Music] rain without water in the air we couldn't live our Fields would be dry and nothing would grow because water evaporates in the air and returns again as rain we have water running through the valleys in our Brooks and streams filling reservoirs with water to drink turning our water wheels and turning the turbines and the powerhouses to give us electricity all from water in the air the fundamentals of global geoengineering are no different than this child's experiment water vapor is artificially introduced into the air in place of the natural evaporation stage and is artificially cooled and condensed to produce [Music] rain you need a great many tea kettal to produce the massive amounts of water vapor required to fuel these Global storm systems and this planet is deliberately covered with them [Music] [Music] this artificial precipitation generation is easy to see on infrared satellite and is identified by sudden coordinated bursts of superheated water vapor from no natural source [Music] [Music] ironically the same primary source of CO2 Emissions on this planet is the same source of artificial [Music] precipitation this Nationwide artificial precipitation generation site clickers like clockwork every single day [Music] hexagonal Center of Vortex with flat size proves geoengineering manufacturer nightly Nationwide coordinated artificial precipitation generation Noti is the total absence of natural precipitation before the nightly generation cycle [Music] manufactured vortex in exactly the same area rotating in the opposite direction twin vortices rotating in opposite directions Drive artificial precipitation to the southeast [Music] [Music] [Music] the same identifying cycle of circular and sudden coordinated bursts of artificial precipitation can be seen all around the world in every industrialized and colonized country [Music] in [Music] [Music] [Music] this man-made Global artificial precipitation cycle is the singular reason for massive and continuous flooding worldwide at least nine states with flash flood watches Coast to Coast tonight in Newton North Carolina look at this the water suddenly Rising above the windows of this family's home you can barely see the tops of their cars there and this roadway washed away a giant collapse under the rains today this as we get new information tonight on those two tropical systems big changes there as well we get to it all beginning with the flooding and the pictures just now coming in here's ABC meteorologist Ginger Z tonight chest deep Rescuers pulling people to Safety in Western North Carolina at least 10 Swiftwater rescues already today thanks I just it was raining so hard I did not see like any of that a state of emergency declared in cataba County more than a foot of rain in less than 24 hours busting storm drains and swallowing street signs and mailboxes it's bad it come up fast since 9:00 it probably come up 3T from the drowning Southeast to the wild Southwest that is Albuquerque New Mexico just yesterday near 90 m per hour wind gust sliced through the typically tranquil Town pour down like like a hurricane people plucked from their flooded cars the desert rains swamping the streets near Tucson Arizona the millions of tons of heavy metal nanen trails and frequency activated ice nucleation used to control these storm systems is a topic for another [Music] video however don't believe that mother nature monsoons in the United States or any other fairy tale is responsible for worldwide man-made flooding that you can't see with your own eyes look up",

Population Division estimates the world population reached 8 billion on November 15, 2022.\nOnly around 4% of the world population (all in Africa) lives in a country with very high fertility \u2014 above 5 children per woman. Even in countries with very high fertility, fertility is generally lower than it was in the past.\nWhy the discrepancy? Many of the world\u2019s most populous countries (such as India and Nigeria), haven\u2019t conducted a census in over 10 years, and many countries lack civil registration and vital statistics systems that accurately record births and deaths among their population.\nGiven the lack of precise population data worldwide, the U.N. and Census Bureau estimates are not that far apart, and both imply similar overall trends.\nThe rate of growth peaked decades ago in the 1960s and has been declining since and is projected to continue declining.\nWhile it took 12.5 years for the world to go from 7 billion to 8 billion people, we project it will likely take 14.1 years to go from 8 billion to 9 billion, and another 16.4 years to go from 9 billion to 10 billion.\nDespite a slowdown, we project the world population will reach 10.2 billion by 2060.\nThese broad global trends mask wide diversity. Population growth is the result of fertility, mortality, migration and the share of the population at certain ages. These trends all differ from country to country and, as a result, population growth varies around the world.\nNearly three quarters (74%) of the earth\u2019s population reside in countries where fertility is around or below the replacement level.\nIt is widely believed that 2.1 is the replacement-level fertility rate \u2014 the number of births a woman would need to have in her lifetime to replace herself and the father. However, the precise level of fertility necessary for long-term replacement varies between countries due to different mortality rates.\nAround 33% of the world population \u2014 approximately 1 in 3 people \u2014 lives in a country with a fertility rate close to replacement, including diverse countries such as India, Tunisia and Argentina.\nDemographers once assumed fertility would stop declining once it reached replacement levels. But it has continued to decline below replacement levels in many countries.\nAround 15% of the world\u2019s population lives in a country with low fertility of 1.6 to 1.8 children per woman. This includes a diverse range of countries like Brazil, Mexico, the United States and Sweden.\nAnother 26% \u2014 about 1 in 4 people \u2014 lives in a country with very low fertility at 1.5 children or fewer per woman. Such countries include China, South Korea and Spain.\nAnother 23% lives in a country with moderately high fertility between 2.3 and 5.0 children. This broad category includes a diverse range of countries like Papua New Guinea, Israel and Ethiopia.\nOnly around 4% of the world population (all in Africa) lives in a country with very high fertility \u2014 above 5 children per woman. Even in countries with very high fertility, fertility is generally lower than it was in the past.\nAnd we project that by 2060, no country will have an average of four or more children per woman, let alone five or six children per woman.\nIt\u2019s projected that Benin will have the world\u2019s highest projected total fertility rate (3.8) in 2060. There will, of course, still be women who have four or more children, but it is unlikely entire countries will average four or more children per woman.\nThe world population is projected to keep growing despite declining fertility rates. In fact, we estimate the number of infants already peaked in 2017. Instead, population growth in the future will come from larger groups of people at adult ages. Demographers call this phenomenon population momentum.\nFigure 3 shows the world population by age in 2023 and the projected population by age in 2060. Population growth between now and 2060 will be from the population pyramid \u201cfilling up\u201d previously sparse older age groups, not from growing numbers of births.\nFigure 4 shows how the growth of the older-adult population is projected to make up most of the population growth between now and 2060. Future population growth will be coincident with population aging.\nAs fertility declines, there are proportionally fewer younger people and more older people.\nThe share of the population at young ages has been declining. Today, 32% of people are 19 or younger. By 2060, that number is projected to slip to 26%.\nAs the share of young people declines, the proportion of people at older ages increases. Today, 10% of the world is 65 or older and their share is projected to double to 20% by 2060.\nAs a result, the median age is changing. Today, the global median age is 32 (half the population is younger and half older). By 2060, however, the global median age is projected to climb to 39 years.\nThese general trends vary by country. Niger is the world\u2019s youngest country, with a median age of 15 in 2023. Monaco, by contrast, is the oldest, with a median age of 56 in 2023.\nIn many countries where young-age mortality is already low, gains in life expectancy come from improving conditions at older ages.\nCanada, for instance, did not experience big declines in young-age mortality between 2000 and 2023, but its total life expectancy increased by an average of about 4 years, largely from reduced mortality at older ages.\nFor many other countries, however, life expectancy trends are driven more by dramatic declines in child mortality. In Niger, for example, child mortality declined from around 224 deaths of children under 5 per 1,000 births in 2000 to 103 deaths per 1,\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

These trends all differ from country to country and, as a result, population growth varies around the world.\nNearly three quarters (74%) of the earth\u2019s population reside in countries where fertility is around or below the replacement level.\nIt is widely believed that 2.1 is the replacement-level fertility rate \u2014 the number of births a woman would need to have in her lifetime to replace herself and the father. However, the precise level of fertility necessary for long-term replacement varies between countries due to different mortality rates.\nAround 33% of the world population \u2014 approximately 1 in 3 people \u2014 lives in a country with a fertility rate close to replacement, including diverse countries such as India, Tunisia and Argentina.\nDemographers once assumed fertility would stop declining once it reached replacement levels. But it has continued to decline below replacement levels in many countries.\nAround 15% of the world\u2019s population lives in a country with low fertility of 1.6 to 1.8 children per woman. This includes a diverse range of countries like Brazil, Mexico, the United States and Sweden.\nAnother 26% \u2014 about 1 in 4 people \u2014 lives in a country with very low fertility at 1.5 children or fewer per woman. Such countries include China, South Korea and Spain.\nAnother 23% lives in a country with moderately high fertility between 2.3 and 5.0 children. This broad category includes a diverse range of countries like Papua New Guinea, Israel and Ethiopia.\nOnly around 4% of the world population (all in Africa) lives in a country with very high fertility \u2014 above 5 children per woman. Even in countries with very high fertility, fertility is generally lower than it was in the past.\nAnd we project that by 2060, no country will have an average of four or more children per woman, let alone five or six children per woman.\nIt\u2019s projected that Benin will have the world\u2019s highest projected total fertility rate (3.8) in 2060. There will, of course, still be women who have four or more children, but it is unlikely entire countries will average four or more children per woman.\nThe world population is projected to keep growing despite declining fertility rates. In fact, we estimate the number of infants already peaked in 2017. Instead, population growth in the future will come from larger groups of people at adult ages. Demographers call this phenomenon population momentum.\nFigure 3 shows the world population by age in 2023 and the projected population by age in 2060. Population growth between now and 2060 will be from the population pyramid \u201cfilling up\u201d previously sparse older age groups, not from growing numbers of births.\nFigure 4 shows how the growth of the older-adult population is projected to make up most of the population growth between now and 2060. Future population growth will be coincident with population aging.\nAs fertility declines, there are proportionally fewer younger people and more older people.\nThe share of the population at young ages has been declining. Today, 32% of people are 19 or younger. By 2060, that number is projected to slip to 26%.\nAs the share of young people declines, the proportion of people at older ages increases. Today, 10% of the world is 65 or older and their share is projected to double to 20% by 2060.\nAs a result, the median age is changing. Today, the global median age is 32 (half the population is younger and half older). By 2060, however, the global median age is projected to climb to 39 years.\nThese general trends vary by country. Niger is the world\u2019s youngest country, with a median age of 15 in 2023. Monaco, by contrast, is the oldest, with a median age of 56 in 2023.\nIn many countries where young-age mortality is already low, gains in life expectancy come from improving conditions at older ages.\nCanada, for instance, did not experience big declines in young-age mortality between 2000 and 2023, but its total life expectancy increased by an average of about 4 years, largely from reduced mortality at older ages.\nFor many other countries, however, life expectancy trends are driven more by dramatic declines in child mortality. In Niger, for example, child mortality declined from around 224 deaths of children under 5 per 1,000 births in 2000 to 103 deaths per 1,\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The purpose of solar geoengineering is to cool the Earth by reflecting more sunlight back to space. Depending on the approach ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nGeoengineering methods are intended to reduce climate change, which is already having demonstrable effects on ecosystem structure and functioning in some regions. Two types of geoengineering activities that have been proposed are: carbon dioxide (CO2) removal (CDR), which removes CO2 from the atmosphere, and solar radiation management (SRM, or sunlight reflection methods), which reflects a small percentage of sunlight back into space to offset warming from greenhouse gases (GHGs). Current research suggests that SRM or CDR might diminish the impacts of climate change on ecosystems by reducing changes in temperature and precipitation. However, sudden cessation of SRM would exacerbate the climate effects on ecosystems, and some CDR might interfere with oceanic and terrestrial ecosystem processes. The many risks and uncertainties associated with these new kinds of purposeful perturbations to the Earth system are not well understood and require cautious and comprehensive research.\nKeywords: Geoengineering, Ecosystems, Climate change, Carbon dioxide removal, Solar radiation management\nAs anthropogenic emissions of GHG rise and their concentrations in the atmosphere continue to increase, there is growing discussion about the need to evaluate \u201cgeoengineering\u201d methods to reduce the greenhouse effects on the climate and environment (Shepherd et al. 2009). Geoengineering can be defined as the deliberate manipulation of features of the Earth system to reduce the magnitude and rate of changes in the physical climate system that are attributed to this accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs; IPCC 2007a). While there has now been much general discussion of the different means by which geoengineering may be accomplished and some speculation about the research strategies by which their effectiveness could be determined (Shepherd et al. 2009), there has been relatively little discussion of research needed to understand their potential for affecting ecosystems. Yet many geoengineering activities could significantly impact both natural and managed ecosystems and their functions. This is important because ecosystems, including those within forests, oceans, grasslands, and wetlands, provide both innate value and our life support systems, including numerous essential goods and services (MEA 2005). This study focuses on research needs related to identifying and quantifying potential ecosystem consequences of proposed geoengineering methods. Ecosystem impacts form a subset of a much broader range of pertinent social and physical science research questions, including issues of governance and ethics, all of which should be addressed before any proposed geoengineering method could be considered as a viable policy option.\nIn this report, we follow the Royal Society (Shepherd et al. 2009) in referring to two different sets of activities: carbon dioxide removal (CDR) methods, including a range of engineered and biological processes to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, and solar radiation management (SRM or sunlight reflection) methods, typically involving reflecting a small percentage of solar light and heat back into space to offset the warming due to GHGs. CDR and SRM techniques are fundamentally different in the timescales over which the interventions would operate (Lenton and Vaughan 2009; Shepherd et al. 2009). The scale-up of a CDR deployment to the point where it would have significant climate effects would be slow (likely decades for a substantial drawdown of CO2), but with long lasting effects. In contrast, SRM could provide rapid cooling (in months) but would require continual renewal. Of these two types of methods, only CDR would address the CO2 concentrations responsible for both climate change as well as other CO2-induced ecosystem effects such as ocean acidification.\nThe Earth\u2019s temperature and climate are fundamentally controlled by its energy balance, which drives and maintains the climate system. This balance consists of incoming energy from the Sun (including ultra violet, visible, and infrared) and outgoing heat (thermal infrared) radiation. These energy streams do not reach or leave Earth\u2019s surface unimpeded. On average, about one third of the incoming sunlight radiation is reflected by clouds and aerosols, ice caps, and bright surfaces. This fraction that is reflected is referred to as its \u201calbedo\u201d. Most incoming energy passes through the atmosphere to reach Earth\u2019s surface; the part not reflected by the albedo is absorbed and so warms the surface. The absorbed energy is transferred to the atmosphere by emitted surface radiation, evaporative cooling, and direct thermal motion. Some outgoing thermal energy then emitted by Earth\u2019s surface is absorbed by GHGs in the atmosphere (mainly by water vapor and CO2) and also by clouds, thus reducing the amount of heat radiation escaping to space and warming the atmosphere and Earth\u2019s surface. This is known as the greenhouse effect. On average, only about 60% of the radiation emitted at the surface leaves the atmosphere, after absorption and emission within the atmosphere. Increased atmospheric CO2 is not only responsible for temperature changes, but for other consequences to the Earth system. In addition, increased CO2 absorbed by the ocean has a measurable effect on ocean acidity, with consequent impacts on ocean biogeochemistry and biodiversity.\nCDR methods are designed to remove CO2 from the atmosphere and transfer it to long-lived carbon reservoirs.

Two types of geoengineering activities that have been proposed are: carbon dioxide (CO2) removal (CDR), which removes CO2 from the atmosphere, and solar radiation management (SRM, or sunlight reflection methods), which reflects a small percentage of sunlight back into space to offset warming from greenhouse gases (GHGs). Current research suggests that SRM or CDR might diminish the impacts of climate change on ecosystems by reducing changes in temperature and precipitation. However, sudden cessation of SRM would exacerbate the climate effects on ecosystems, and some CDR might interfere with oceanic and terrestrial ecosystem processes. The many risks and uncertainties associated with these new kinds of purposeful perturbations to the Earth system are not well understood and require cautious and comprehensive research.\nKeywords: Geoengineering, Ecosystems, Climate change, Carbon dioxide removal, Solar radiation management\nAs anthropogenic emissions of GHG rise and their concentrations in the atmosphere continue to increase, there is growing discussion about the need to evaluate \u201cgeoengineering\u201d methods to reduce the greenhouse effects on the climate and environment (Shepherd et al. 2009). Geoengineering can be defined as the deliberate manipulation of features of the Earth system to reduce the magnitude and rate of changes in the physical climate system that are attributed to this accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs; IPCC 2007a). While there has now been much general discussion of the different means by which geoengineering may be accomplished and some speculation about the research strategies by which their effectiveness could be determined (Shepherd et al. 2009), there has been relatively little discussion of research needed to understand their potential for affecting ecosystems. Yet many geoengineering activities could significantly impact both natural and managed ecosystems and their functions. This is important because ecosystems, including those within forests, oceans, grasslands, and wetlands, provide both innate value and our life support systems, including numerous essential goods and services (MEA 2005). This study focuses on research needs related to identifying and quantifying potential ecosystem consequences of proposed geoengineering methods. Ecosystem impacts form a subset of a much broader range of pertinent social and physical science research questions, including issues of governance and ethics, all of which should be addressed before any proposed geoengineering method could be considered as a viable policy option.\nIn this report, we follow the Royal Society (Shepherd et al. 2009) in referring to two different sets of activities: carbon dioxide removal (CDR) methods, including a range of engineered and biological processes to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, and solar radiation management (SRM or sunlight reflection) methods, typically involving reflecting a small percentage of solar light and heat back into space to offset the warming due to GHGs. CDR and SRM techniques are fundamentally different in the timescales over which the interventions would operate (Lenton and Vaughan 2009; Shepherd et al. 2009).

The first round unfolded as rich tropical mid-upper level moisture from the remnants from Hurricane Norma, in the eastern Pacific Ocean, combined with Gulf moisture on Monday (October 23rd). Moisture, clouds and areas of rain streamed northward out of the Permian Basin Monday morning, spreading across the central and eastern South Plains and all of the Rolling Plains Monday afternoon into Monday evening.\nOver the course of the two events, spanning from late Monday through early Wednesday, the entire region received measurable rainfall. The heaviest rain targeted the central and southern South Plains into the Rolling Plains, where totals of 1 to 3 inches were common. Lighter amounts, from 1/3 to 3/4 of an inch were generally found along and north of a Plains to Abernathy to Matador to Wellington line. A couple locations, including Guthrie and Lake Alan Henry, even recorded over 3 inches or rain.\nOfficially, the Lubbock Airport measured 1.41 inches of rain over this 3-day period, boosting the year-to-date total to 16.09 inches, which is just shy of the long term average. Childress officially recorded 1.12 inches over this same period, increasing their annual total to 24.01 inches, nearly 3 inches above average.\nIn addition to the widespread rain, a few spots saw gusty winds and even small hail.

They are: MOISTURE, INSTABILITY, and LIFTING. Additionally, there is a fourth ingredient (WIND SHEAR) for severe thunderstorms and each are covered separately and in-depth farther down:\nAs a general rule, the surface dewpoint needs to be 55 degrees Fahrenheit or greater for a surface based thunderstorm to occur. A dewpoint of less than this is unfavorable for thunderstorms because the moist adiabatic lapse rate has more stable parcel lapse rate at colder dewpoints. Dewpoints at the surface can be less than 55 degrees Fahrenheit in the case of elevated thunderstorms.\nInstability also decreases as low-level moisture decreases. Instability occurs when a parcel of air is warmer than the environmental air and rises on its own due to positive buoyancy. Instability is often expressed using positive CAPE or negative LI values. Instability is what allows air in the low levels of the atmosphere to rise into the upper levels of the atmosphere. Without instability, the atmosphere will not support deep convection and thunderstorms. Instability can be increased through daytime heating. Lift is what gives a parcel of air the impetus to rise from the low levels of the atmosphere to the elevation where positive buoyancy is realized. Very often, instability will exist in the middle and upper levels of the troposphere but not in the lower troposphere. Low level stability is often referred to as negative CAPE, convective inhibition, or the cap.\nIt is lift that allows air in the low levels of the troposphere to overcome low level convective inhibition. Lift is often referred to as a trigger mechanism. There are many lift mechanisms. A list of many of them follows: fronts, low level convergence, low level WAA, low level moisture advection, mesoscale convergence boundaries such as outflow and sea breeze boundaries, orographic upslope, frictional convergence, vorticity, and jet streak. All these processes force the air to rise. The region that has the greatest combination of these lift mechanisms is often the location that storms first develop. Moisture and instability must also be considered. A thunderstorm will form first and develop toward the region that has the best combination of: high PBL moisture, low convective inhibition, CAPE and lifting mechanisms.\nThe difference between a thunderstorm and a severe thunderstorm is the wind field. For a severe thunderstorm, the ingredients that must be present are moisture, instability, lift and strong speed and directional storm relative wind shear. Ideally, wind will have a veering directional change of 60 degrees or more from the surface to 700 millibars, upper level winds will be greater than 70 knots, and the 850 to 700 mb winds (low level jet) will be 25 knots or greater. Wind shear aids in the following: Tilting a storm (displacing updraft from downdraft), allows the updraft to sustain itself for a longer period of time, allows the development of a mesocyclone, and allows rotating air to be ingested into the updraft (tornadogenesis).\nSevere storms also tend to have these characteristics over ordinary thunderstorms: higher CAPE, drier air in the middle levels of the atmosphere (convective instability), better moisture convergence, baroclinic atmosphere, and more powerful lift.\nLow level moisture is assessed by examining boundary layer dewpoints. Severe thunderstorms are more likely when the surface dewpoint is 55 F or higher, all else being equal. Low dewpoint values inhibit sufficient latent heat release and significantly reduce the tornado threat.\nTornadoes are more likely when the LCL is relatively low as compared to relatively high. The depth of moisture in the lower troposphere and the rate of moisture advection are also important to examine.\nWhile a lack of moisture in the lower troposphere reduces the severe storm threat, a lack of moisture in the middle troposphere is helpful to the severe storm threat if there is abundant moisture in the lower troposphere. Convective (potential) instability is present in this situation.\nThe advection of higher dew point values into the boundary layer can increase instability in a severe weather situation. This is often accomplished by advection from a warm ocean source.\nThere are different types of instability and each one of these will be discussed. The release of instability causes air to accelerate in the vertical. This is the reason air rises so quickly to form thunderstorms. Instability is a condition in which air will rise freely on its own due to positive buoyancy. As an example, imagine a basketball at the bottom of a swimming pool. Once the basketball is released it accelerates upward to the top of the pool. The basketball rises because it is less dense than the water surrounding it. A similar process occurs when instability is released in the atmosphere. Air in the lower troposphere is lifted until it becomes less dense than surrounding air. Once it is less dense it rises on its own. The speed that is rises depends on the density difference between the air rising and the surrounding air. In any thunderstorm, rising motion is occurring since that air rising in the updraft of the storm is less dense than the surrounding air.\nParcel instability (also called Static Instability) is assessed by examining CAPE and/or the Lifted Index. Two common measures of CAPE are SBCAPE (surface based CAPE) and MUCAPE (most unstable CAPE). CAPE of 1,500 J/kg is large with values above 2,500 J/kg being extremely large instability. LI values less than -4 are large with values less than -7 representing extreme instability. High instability allows for high accelerations within of the updraft. A strong updraft is important to hail generation.\nThis is instability caused by the release of latent heat. Latent instability increases as the average dewpoint in the PBL, or in the region that lifting begins, increases. The more latent heat that is released, the more\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

    "input_prompt": "Claim:\nMassive amounts of water vapor are required to fuel global storm systems.\n\nArticle Title:\nAtmospheric river - Wikipedia\n\nGoogle Search Snippet:\nAtmospheric rivers consist of narrow bands of enhanced water vapor transport, typically along the boundaries between large areas of divergent surface air flow, ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nThere are three ingredients that must be present for a thunderstorm to occur. They are: MOISTURE, INSTABILITY, and LIFTING. Additionally, there is a fourth ingredient (WIND SHEAR) for severe thunderstorms and each are covered separately and in-depth farther down:\nAs a general rule, the surface dewpoint needs to be 55 degrees Fahrenheit or greater for a surface based thunderstorm to occur. A dewpoint of less than this is unfavorable for thunderstorms because the moist adiabatic lapse rate has more stable parcel lapse rate at colder dewpoints. Dewpoints at the surface can be less than 55 degrees Fahrenheit in the case of elevated thunderstorms.\nInstability also decreases as low-level moisture decreases. Instability occurs when a parcel of air is warmer than the environmental air and rises on its own due to positive buoyancy. Instability is often expressed using positive CAPE or negative LI values. Instability is what allows air in the low levels of the atmosphere to rise into the upper levels of the atmosphere. Without instability, the atmosphere will not support deep convection and thunderstorms. Instability can be increased through daytime heating. Lift is what gives a parcel of air the impetus to rise from the low levels of the atmosphere to the elevation where positive buoyancy is realized. Very often, instability will exist in the middle and upper levels of the troposphere but not in the lower troposphere. Low level stability is often referred to as negative CAPE, convective inhibition, or the cap.\nIt is lift that allows air in the low levels of the troposphere to overcome low level convective inhibition. Lift is often referred to as a trigger mechanism. There are many lift mechanisms. A list of many of them follows: fronts, low level convergence, low level WAA, low level moisture advection, mesoscale convergence boundaries such as outflow and sea breeze boundaries, orographic upslope, frictional convergence, vorticity, and jet streak. All these processes force the air to rise. The region that has the greatest combination of these lift mechanisms is often the location that storms first develop. Moisture and instability must also be considered. A thunderstorm will form first and develop toward the region that has the best combination of: high PBL moisture, low convective inhibition, CAPE and lifting mechanisms.\nThe difference between a thunderstorm and a severe thunderstorm is the wind field. For a severe thunderstorm, the ingredients that must be present are moisture, instability, lift and strong speed and directional storm relative wind shear. Ideally, wind will have a veering directional change of 60 degrees or more from the surface to 700 millibars, upper level winds will be greater than 70 knots, and the 850 to 700 mb winds (low level jet) will be 25 knots or greater. Wind shear aids in the following: Tilting a storm (displacing updraft from downdraft), allows the updraft to sustain itself for a longer period of time, allows the development of a mesocyclone, and allows rotating air to be ingested into the updraft (tornadogenesis).\nSevere storms also tend to have these characteristics over ordinary thunderstorms: higher CAPE, drier air in the middle levels of the atmosphere (convective instability), better moisture convergence, baroclinic atmosphere, and more powerful lift.\nLow level moisture is assessed by examining boundary layer dewpoints. Severe thunderstorms are more likely when the surface dewpoint is 55 F or higher, all else being equal. Low dewpoint values inhibit sufficient latent heat release and significantly reduce the tornado threat.\nTornadoes are more likely when the LCL is relatively low as compared to relatively high. The depth of moisture in the lower troposphere and the rate of moisture advection are also important to examine.\nWhile a lack of moisture in the lower troposphere reduces the severe storm threat, a lack of moisture in the middle troposphere is helpful to the severe storm threat if there is abundant moisture in the lower troposphere. Convective (potential) instability is present in this situation.\nThe advection of higher dew point values into the boundary layer can increase instability in a severe weather situation. This is often accomplished by advection from a warm ocean source.\nThere are different types of instability and each one of these will be discussed. The release of instability causes air to accelerate in the vertical. This is the reason air rises so quickly to form thunderstorms. Instability is a condition in which air will rise freely on its own due to positive buoyancy. As an example, imagine a basketball at the bottom of a swimming pool. Once the basketball is released it accelerates upward to the top of the pool. The basketball rises because it is less dense than the water surrounding it. A similar process occurs when instability is released in the atmosphere. Air in the lower troposphere is lifted until it becomes less dense than surrounding air. Once it is less dense it rises on its own. The speed that is rises depends on the density difference between the air rising and the surrounding air. In any thunderstorm, rising motion is occurring since that air rising in the updraft of the storm is less dense than the surrounding air.\nParcel instability (also called Static Instability) is assessed by examining CAPE and/or the Lifted Index. Two common measures of CAPE are SBCAPE (surface based CAPE) and MUCAPE (most unstable CAPE). CAPE of 1,500 J/kg is large with values above 2,500 J/kg being extremely large instability. LI values less than -4 are large with values less than -7 representing extreme instability. High instability allows for high accelerations within of the updraft. A strong updraft is important to hail generation.\nThis is instability caused by the release of latent heat. Latent instability increases as the average dewpoint in the PBL, or in the region that lifting begins, increases. The more latent heat that is released, the more\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

    "input_prompt": "Claim:\nMassive amounts of water vapor are required to fuel global storm systems.\n\nArticle Title:\nIngredients for a Thunderstorm - NOAA\n\nGoogle Search Snippet:\nOceans are the typical source of moisture for thunderstorms, and water temperature plays a large role in just how much moisture gets added to ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nThere are three ingredients that must be present for a thunderstorm to occur. They are: MOISTURE, INSTABILITY, and LIFTING. Additionally, there is a fourth ingredient (WIND SHEAR) for severe thunderstorms and each are covered separately and in-depth farther down:\nAs a general rule, the surface dewpoint needs to be 55 degrees Fahrenheit or greater for a surface based thunderstorm to occur. A dewpoint of less than this is unfavorable for thunderstorms because the moist adiabatic lapse rate has more stable parcel lapse rate at colder dewpoints. Dewpoints at the surface can be less than 55 degrees Fahrenheit in the case of elevated thunderstorms.\nInstability also decreases as low-level moisture decreases. Instability occurs when a parcel of air is warmer than the environmental air and rises on its own due to positive buoyancy. Instability is often expressed using positive CAPE or negative LI values. Instability is what allows air in the low levels of the atmosphere to rise into the upper levels of the atmosphere. Without instability, the atmosphere will not support deep convection and thunderstorms. Instability can be increased through daytime heating. Lift is what gives a parcel of air the impetus to rise from the low levels of the atmosphere to the elevation where positive buoyancy is realized. Very often, instability will exist in the middle and upper levels of the troposphere but not in the lower troposphere. Low level stability is often referred to as negative CAPE, convective inhibition, or the cap.\nIt is lift that allows air in the low levels of the troposphere to overcome low level convective inhibition. Lift is often referred to as a trigger mechanism. There are many lift mechanisms. A list of many of them follows: fronts, low level convergence, low level WAA, low level moisture advection, mesoscale convergence boundaries such as outflow and sea breeze boundaries, orographic upslope, frictional convergence, vorticity, and jet streak. All these processes force the air to rise. The region that has the greatest combination of these lift mechanisms is often the location that storms first develop. Moisture and instability must also be considered. A thunderstorm will form first and develop toward the region that has the best combination of: high PBL moisture, low convective inhibition, CAPE and lifting mechanisms.\nThe difference between a thunderstorm and a severe thunderstorm is the wind field. For a severe thunderstorm, the ingredients that must be present are moisture, instability, lift and strong speed and directional storm relative wind shear. Ideally, wind will have a veering directional change of 60 degrees or more from the surface to 700 millibars, upper level winds will be greater than 70 knots, and the 850 to 700 mb winds (low level jet) will be 25 knots or greater. Wind shear aids in the following: Tilting a storm (displacing updraft from downdraft), allows the updraft to sustain itself for a longer period of time, allows the development of a mesocyclone, and allows rotating air to be ingested into the updraft (tornadogenesis).\nSevere storms also tend to have these characteristics over ordinary thunderstorms: higher CAPE, drier air in the middle levels of the atmosphere (convective instability), better moisture convergence, baroclinic atmosphere, and more powerful lift.\nLow level moisture is assessed by examining boundary layer dewpoints. Severe thunderstorms are more likely when the surface dewpoint is 55 F or higher, all else being equal. Low dewpoint values inhibit sufficient latent heat release and significantly reduce the tornado threat.\nTornadoes are more likely when the LCL is relatively low as compared to relatively high. The depth of moisture in the lower troposphere and the rate of moisture advection are also important to examine.\nWhile a lack of moisture in the lower troposphere reduces the severe storm threat, a lack of moisture in the middle troposphere is helpful to the severe storm threat if there is abundant moisture in the lower troposphere. Convective (potential) instability is present in this situation.\nThe advection of higher dew point values into the boundary layer can increase instability in a severe weather situation. This is often accomplished by advection from a warm ocean source.\nThere are different types of instability and each one of these will be discussed. The release of instability causes air to accelerate in the vertical. This is the reason air rises so quickly to form thunderstorms. Instability is a condition in which air will rise freely on its own due to positive buoyancy. As an example, imagine a basketball at the bottom of a swimming pool. Once the basketball is released it accelerates upward to the top of the pool. The basketball rises because it is less dense than the water surrounding it. A similar process occurs when instability is released in the atmosphere. Air in the lower troposphere is lifted until it becomes less dense than surrounding air. Once it is less dense it rises on its own. The speed that is rises depends on the density difference between the air rising and the surrounding air. In any thunderstorm, rising motion is occurring since that air rising in the updraft of the storm is less dense than the surrounding air.\nParcel instability (also called Static Instability) is assessed by examining CAPE and/or the Lifted Index. Two common measures of CAPE are SBCAPE (surface based CAPE) and MUCAPE (most unstable CAPE). CAPE of 1,500 J/kg is large with values above 2,500 J/kg being extremely large instability. LI values less than -4 are large with values less than -7 representing extreme instability. High instability allows for high accelerations within of the updraft. A strong updraft is important to hail generation.\nThis is instability caused by the release of latent heat. Latent instability increases as the average dewpoint in the PBL, or in the region that lifting begins, increases. The more latent heat that is released, the more\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Years ago, I remember when \u201csatellite view\u201d meant blurry green blobs on a screen. Now, we can see individual trees, cars and even shadows cast by buildings. We finally have the power to witness our planet as it truly is: scarred, altering and astonishingly interconnected. It\u2019s a turning point in how we see, understand and ultimately protect our planet.\nBut as someone who\u2019s followed these technologies closely, I believe the real revolution won\u2019t come from sharper satellite imagery \u2014 it will come from what we choose to do with what it reveals. Every pixel now carries a moral weight. If we can see the problem, we can no longer claim ignorance, whether it be deforestation in the Amazon, floods or wildfires in California.\nHigh-resolution satellites don\u2019t simply take pictures. They record the energy reflected from Earth\u2019s surface across multiple wavelengths, from visible light to infrared, creating images that function more like medical scans of the planet\u2019s body. Scientists can now diagnose ecological \u201csymptoms\u201d \u2014 the health of crops, the purity of water or the pace of urban sprawl \u2014 using satellite imagery of high resolution.\nBut do we really use this \u201cmiracle\u201d in full? We\u2019ve built a technology that can literally see environmental destruction almost in real time. High-resolution imagery gives us tools to act precisely to protect ecosystems before they collapse, to farm smartly and reduce waste and to manage disasters immediately. But too often we don\u2019t act fast enough. Bureaucracy, waiting for reports, budgets or \u201cconfirmation,\u201d can cost lives and kill the action plan that is on our finger tips.\nYet there\u2019s a paradox. The more clearly satellites see, the more data they generate, to the point that it\u2019s too much for any human team to process. That\u2019s why the next revolution isn\u2019t in the sky, but in the algorithms interpreting it.\nArtificial intelligence, especially Convolutional Neural Networks, can now analyze thousands of images to identify subtle, long-term changes invisible to the human eye. AI can tell the difference between trees naturally shedding leaves and a forest being cleared. It can distinguish between seasonal flooding and permanent damage.\nThese systems achieve over 90% accuracy in identifying deforestation and new urban development, which is fantastic. But it\u2019s not just a technical accomplishment, it\u2019s a fact of how human knowledge and creativity can work with machine learning for the planet.\nAnd I see an irony: We\u2019ve created technology powerful enough to predict ecological collapse, but we still struggle to fund the servers to process the data. Access remains inconsistent. High-resolution data is often closed behind paywalls, while many conservationists and ecological researchers in developing regions, the ones who most need it, can\u2019t afford entry.\nIf we truly believe in \u201cenvironmental intelligence,\u201d we have to make it democratic. AI and satellite data must be open, shared and trusted. Otherwise, we risk building a surveillance system for profit, not for the planet.\nIf the past decade was about seeing Earth more clearly, the next will be about understanding it more deeply. Ultra-high-resolution imagery, smarter AI and scalable cloud analytics are becoming the three pillars of environmental intelligence.\nAccording to the European Space Agency, more than 1,500 Earth observation satellites will orbit the planet by 2030, many of them small, agile and capable of revisiting the same location multiple times a day.\nBut here\u2019s my argument: Technology alone won\u2019t save us. It never has. The satellite can take the picture, but only people can make the decision to change. Governments, industries and scientists must work together to make these insights widely accessible, interpretable and ethically used. Otherwise, we\u2019ll have perfect vision of a dying world and no power to intervene.\nWe\u2019ve never been this close to understanding Earth in its full complexity. High-resolution imagery, AI and open data together create what I like to call the conscience of the planet. They show us the truth without filters.\nBut what will we do with that truth? Will we use it to justify endless reports, or to spark real change? Every flood, every burned forest, every cracked riverbed now has a timestamp and a coordinate. We can\u2019t say \u201cwe didn\u2019t know.\u201d We do know. We see it in painfully sharp detail.\nAnd that\u2019s why I believe satellite environmental intelligence must become a shared global mission, not a competition between nations or companies. Because when we look at Earth from space, there are no borders, only consequences.\nThe satellites are already doing their part. Now it\u2019s our turn to do ours.\nKateryna Sergieieva has a Ph.D. in information technologies and 15 years of experience in remote sensing.

Wind shear aids in the following: Tilting a storm (displacing updraft from downdraft), allows the updraft to sustain itself for a longer period of time, allows the development of a mesocyclone, and allows rotating air to be ingested into the updraft (tornadogenesis).\nSevere storms also tend to have these characteristics over ordinary thunderstorms: higher CAPE, drier air in the middle levels of the atmosphere (convective instability), better moisture convergence, baroclinic atmosphere, and more powerful lift.\nLow level moisture is assessed by examining boundary layer dewpoints. Severe thunderstorms are more likely when the surface dewpoint is 55 F or higher, all else being equal. Low dewpoint values inhibit sufficient latent heat release and significantly reduce the tornado threat.\nTornadoes are more likely when the LCL is relatively low as compared to relatively high. The depth of moisture in the lower troposphere and the rate of moisture advection are also important to examine.\nWhile a lack of moisture in the lower troposphere reduces the severe storm threat, a lack of moisture in the middle troposphere is helpful to the severe storm threat if there is abundant moisture in the lower troposphere. Convective (potential) instability is present in this situation.\nThe advection of higher dew point values into the boundary layer can increase instability in a severe weather situation. This is often accomplished by advection from a warm ocean source.\nThere are different types of instability and each one of these will be discussed. The release of instability causes air to accelerate in the vertical. This is the reason air rises so quickly to form thunderstorms. Instability is a condition in which air will rise freely on its own due to positive buoyancy. As an example, imagine a basketball at the bottom of a swimming pool. Once the basketball is released it accelerates upward to the top of the pool. The basketball rises because it is less dense than the water surrounding it. A similar process occurs when instability is released in the atmosphere. Air in the lower troposphere is lifted until it becomes less dense than surrounding air. Once it is less dense it rises on its own. The speed that is rises depends on the density difference between the air rising and the surrounding air. In any thunderstorm, rising motion is occurring since that air rising in the updraft of the storm is less dense than the surrounding air.\nParcel instability (also called Static Instability) is assessed by examining CAPE and/or the Lifted Index. Two common measures of CAPE are SBCAPE (surface based CAPE) and MUCAPE (most unstable CAPE). CAPE of 1,500 J/kg is large with values above 2,500 J/kg being extremely large instability. LI values less than -4 are large with values less than -7 representing extreme instability. High instability allows for high accelerations within of the updraft. A strong updraft is important to hail generation.\nThis is instability caused by the release of latent heat. Latent instability increases as the average dewpoint in the PBL, or in the region that lifting begins, increases. The more latent heat that is released, the more\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Monthly Weather Summary (CLM). Routine Temperature ... Precipitation data includes both calendar year and water year totals ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nThis post is part of our year-long series about North Carolina\u2019s weather extremes.\nOne of our state\u2019s most notable floods wreaked havoc on western North Carolina residents in July 1916, breaking multiple records and leaving death and destruction in its wake.\nIn late June 1916, a tropical depression formed in the western Caribbean just east of Nicaragua. The storm reached hurricane status as it entered the Gulf of Mexico, making landfall in Mobile, AL at Category 3 strength on July 5. As is the case with many tropical cyclones, intensity drastically decreased soon after landfall. However, the system remained intact for several days, taking a very slow and winding trek over the Southeast. Eventually coming to linger over the Southern Appalachian mountains, the storm brought several inches of rain to western North Carolina for over a week \u2014 most notably on July 8-10 \u2014 saturating soils and filling stream banks to the brim.\nAs rains from the Gulf Coast storm began tapering off, another storm brewing in the Atlantic made its journey toward the eastern U.S. This storm made landfall on July 14, 1916 near Charleston, SC as a Category 2 hurricane, and traipsed across the state on a northwestern track. While many tropical cyclones often take a more northeastern course once they reach higher latitudes, a large area of high pressure over the New England states prevented such a track, forcing the storm in the direction of the Southern Appalachians. In the morning hours of Saturday, July 15, heavy rain from the storm began to fall across North Carolina, stretching from the eastern foothills to the Blue Ridge Mountains. By Sunday, precipitation totals in western NC ranged from 5 inches to over 20 inches.\nThe storm\u2019s northwesterly track, along with the orientation of winds, lined up almost exactly perpendicular to the peaks in the northern mountains, putting this area in a prime location for upsloping. As a result, a weather station in Altapass measured 22.22 inches of rain from 2:00pm July 15 to 2:00pm July 16, shattering the U.S. record for the most rainfall within 24 hours at that time. While this U.S. record has since been broken and currently stands with a station in Texas, Altapass still holds the statewide record for most rainfall observed in a 24-hour period.\nBut the story still wasn\u2019t over. With the ground thoroughly soaked, and lakes and streams already at capacity as a result of the tremendous amount of rain observed in the weeks prior, the water had nowhere to go \u2014 and soon unleashed its fury across the region.\nThe French Broad River quickly became inundated as the raging waters flowed into the heart of Asheville at high speeds and volumes never-before experienced. Upon colliding with the Swannanoa, floodwaters rapidly overtook Biltmore Village, resulting in one of the worst incidents of flooding that area has ever seen. A streamflow gauge along the French Broad reached a stage of 18.6 feet at 9:00am on July 16. By 10:00am, the bridge to which the gauge was attached was completely destroyed, and water continued to rise to an estimated 21 feet \u2014 10.4 feet above the record flood at that time.\nMeanwhile the Catawba River was experiencing its own turmoil. A streamflow gauge in Mount Holly reached an estimated stage of 45.5 feet (almost double the record previously set in 1901) \u2014 an estimate, mind you, due to the fact that this gauge, too, had been completed washed away by the torrential waters.\nLandslides were observed left and right as the floodwaters engulfed the region. Homes and business were swept away; crops were completely wiped out; numerous bridges and mills were demolished; and several railroad lines were severely damaged. In one particular case, a railroad trestle over the Catawba River was completely washed away. The event claimed the lives of more than 80 people overall, including workers with the Southern Railway Company as they attempted cleanup in the days to follow.\nFloodwaters took roughly 2 days to completely recede. Estimated damage costs over the region exceeded $22 million, which equates to roughly $480 million by today\u2019s standards. Perhaps the greatest single loss of property was that of the Southern Railway Company, which suffered damages around $1.2 million as a result of broken railways, shattered roundhouses, and flooded passenger stations. Of course, this figure doesn\u2019t take into account the decreased railroad traffic the company endured, nor the cost they accrued in having to detour trains.\nWhile an exact timeline is unknown, the greater mountain region eventually recovered. Homes that had been destroyed were rebuilt, and industries devastated by the destruction eventually sprang back to life.\nMany people remember a similar flood that rivals the devastation seen in North Carolina back in 1916 \u2014 one that occurred over the same area just over a decade ago. In 2004, western NC was hit repeatedly as two hurricanes \u2014 Frances and Ivan \u2014 trekked over the region with only 9 days separating them. Flood water levels from both the 1916 flood and that of 2004 were nearly identical, as were precipitation totals. The highest rainfall amount reported with Hurricane Frances was 18.1 inches in Linville Falls, while Cruso, NC received the most precipitation from Hurricane Ivan just days later with a 17-inch total.\nAlthough the destruction from the 2004 flood wasn\u2019t as great as the 1916 event, it did take a toll on western North Carolina. Eleven deaths were reported due to the flooding from Frances and Ivan, and damages were estimated at nearly $200 million.\nAnd while other events have threatened the Altapass record from July 1916 \u2014 such as the 18+ inches observed in Southport as Hurricane Floyd passed through in September 1999 \u2014 the torrential rainfall it received in just 24 hours remains unchallenged in North Carolina\u2019s record books.\nSources:\nPublished in Climate Blog, Events.

The first is a dissipating thunderstorm or shower. Second, the midlevel atmospheric environment must be hot and dry, combined with a shallow surface inversion. Thunderstorms develop when moist, unstable air is given a nudge upward. Moisture in the cloud condenses and later falls as precipitation. Once the thunderstorm loses its updraft, the thunderstorm is said to be downdraft dominated. When this occurs with a hot and dry atmospheric midlevel in place, the moisture associated with the downdraft evaporates and initially cools this layer, increasing its rate of descent toward the surface. However, the descending air will stop cooling once all the moisture has evaporated, therefore causing adiabatic (compressional) warming and mixing of the warm (inversion) layer. The heat burst will occur once the warm and dry air descends to the surface.\nWhen and where do they typically occur?\nHeat bursts generally occur in the late spring and summer seasons. Spring and summertime thunderstorm activity is generally associated with daytime heating, and these said thunderstorms begin to dissipate during the evening hours because they lose their main source of energy. Accordingly, you can usually expect heat bursts to occur in the evening or overnight hours.\nIn New Mexico, heat bursts are most common across the eastern plains. Thunderstorms tend to roll off the higher terrain during the afternoon hours and across the plains during the evening and overnight periods. Generally, a surface inversion will already be in place once thunderstorms begin to dissipate. It is possible for heat bursts to occur west of the central mountain chain if the appropriate conditions are in place, however, a sparse surface observations make it difficult to quantify such events.\nWhat are the effects of a Heat Burst?\nHeat bursts cause a rapid increase in surface temperature, a substantial decrease in surface dewpoint, and on some occasions damaging winds. Recorded temperatures have been known to exceed 100 degrees. This was the case in Wichita, Kansas shortly after midnight on June 9, 2011. The temperature rose from 85 degrees at 1222 am to 102 degrees at 1242 am. Wind speeds have also been known to exceed 70 or 80 mph, as was the case near Clovis, New Mexico below. Winds associated with heat bursts have the potential to rip roofs off buildings, damage trees, or just relocate lawn furniture.\nExamples of Heat Bursts in New Mexico\nOn June 3, 2011, the Cannon Air Force Base (KCVS) recorded a wind gust of 90 mph (78 knots) at 0230Z (8:30 pm MDT). No severe thunderstorms were in the area, only lingering showers from earlier thunderstorm activity. The 90 mph wind gust was caused by a heat burst. At 755 pm, the temperature at KCVS was 71\u00b0F and 35 minutes later it jumped to 77\u00b0F, which correlates to the onset of the strong winds. KCVS also recorded a drop in dewpoint temperature from 50\u00b0F to 43\u00b0F during the same time frame.\nThe 90 mph wind gust was recorded at 0230z, just 1 minute prior to the reflectivity (left) and velocity (right) images from the Cannon AFB radar (KFDX) below. The thick white lines in the images are county borders., and velocities are in knots. The reflectivity image clearly shows light showery precipitation in a serpentine (thin, snake-like) structure (though not shown, the weak reflectivities snaked well into Texas). This type of reflectivity structure is common during heat bursts. However, in the velocity image, there is no indication that there were winds anywhere near 90 mph. This shows that the impact from heat bursts can be very localized, and hard to warn for.\nBelow is a graph of the observations at Cannon Air Force Base on June 3, 2011, illustrating the temperature increase and associated dew point decrease (described above) at the time of the heat burst (purple box).\nAnother strong heat burst occurred almost 6 hours later near Clayton. This time, however, the temperature rose a whopping 14 degrees in the middle of the night. Between 1255 and 155 am, the temperature jumped from 63 to 77 degrees, while the dewpoint dropped from 46 to 36 degrees. The wind gust at the Clayton ASOS peaked at 56 knots (64 mph). This rather unique event was described in a separate feature, available here.\nAround 951 pm MDT (0351Z) on June 19, 2011, a possible heat burst occurred west of the central mountains. The Albuquerque radar (KABX) reflectivity images (loop below) show a prominent snake-like structure (or radar signature) to the showers west of Cuba. Unfortunately, the lack of surface observations in this area of New Mexico cannot prove or deny that a heat burst occurred. However, at the Mesa Chivato RAWS site, approximately 15 miles southeast of the the radar signature, the temperature increased 4 degrees, from 63 to 67, between 851 and 951 pm, though the dewpoint only decreased one degree over this time frame.\nCURRENT HAZARDS Outlooks Submit A Storm Report Severe and Hazardous Weather Info\nCURRENT CONDITIONS Surface Observations Observed Precipitation Satellite Local Satellite Page Local Observations Page Map of Latest Wind and Precipitation Reports\nRADAR National Radar ABX Albuquerque Radar FDX Cannon Air Force Base Radar\nFORECASTS Fire Weather Forecasts Area Forecast Discussion Hourly View Forecast Activity Planner Aviation Forecasts Local Forecast Page Graphical Forecasts\nHYDROLOGY Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Services Local Hydrology Products\nCLIMATE AND PAST WEATHER Climate Graphs Drought Severe T-Storm Climatology for NM Local Data Winter Climatology for NM NOAA Climate Center Climate Prediction Center\nLOCAL PROGRAMS About Our Office SKYWARN NOAA We\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

KSHB. In the Plains, 90 percent ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nThere are three ingredients that must be present for a thunderstorm to occur. They are: MOISTURE, INSTABILITY, and LIFTING. Additionally, there is a fourth ingredient (WIND SHEAR) for severe thunderstorms and each are covered separately and in-depth farther down:\nAs a general rule, the surface dewpoint needs to be 55 degrees Fahrenheit or greater for a surface based thunderstorm to occur. A dewpoint of less than this is unfavorable for thunderstorms because the moist adiabatic lapse rate has more stable parcel lapse rate at colder dewpoints. Dewpoints at the surface can be less than 55 degrees Fahrenheit in the case of elevated thunderstorms.\nInstability also decreases as low-level moisture decreases. Instability occurs when a parcel of air is warmer than the environmental air and rises on its own due to positive buoyancy. Instability is often expressed using positive CAPE or negative LI values. Instability is what allows air in the low levels of the atmosphere to rise into the upper levels of the atmosphere. Without instability, the atmosphere will not support deep convection and thunderstorms. Instability can be increased through daytime heating. Lift is what gives a parcel of air the impetus to rise from the low levels of the atmosphere to the elevation where positive buoyancy is realized. Very often, instability will exist in the middle and upper levels of the troposphere but not in the lower troposphere. Low level stability is often referred to as negative CAPE, convective inhibition, or the cap.\nIt is lift that allows air in the low levels of the troposphere to overcome low level convective inhibition. Lift is often referred to as a trigger mechanism. There are many lift mechanisms. A list of many of them follows: fronts, low level convergence, low level WAA, low level moisture advection, mesoscale convergence boundaries such as outflow and sea breeze boundaries, orographic upslope, frictional convergence, vorticity, and jet streak. All these processes force the air to rise. The region that has the greatest combination of these lift mechanisms is often the location that storms first develop. Moisture and instability must also be considered. A thunderstorm will form first and develop toward the region that has the best combination of: high PBL moisture, low convective inhibition, CAPE and lifting mechanisms.\nThe difference between a thunderstorm and a severe thunderstorm is the wind field. For a severe thunderstorm, the ingredients that must be present are moisture, instability, lift and strong speed and directional storm relative wind shear. Ideally, wind will have a veering directional change of 60 degrees or more from the surface to 700 millibars, upper level winds will be greater than 70 knots, and the 850 to 700 mb winds (low level jet) will be 25 knots or greater. Wind shear aids in the following: Tilting a storm (displacing updraft from downdraft), allows the updraft to sustain itself for a longer period of time, allows the development of a mesocyclone, and allows rotating air to be ingested into the updraft (tornadogenesis).\nSevere storms also tend to have these characteristics over ordinary thunderstorms: higher CAPE, drier air in the middle levels of the atmosphere (convective instability), better moisture convergence, baroclinic atmosphere, and more powerful lift.\nLow level moisture is assessed by examining boundary layer dewpoints. Severe thunderstorms are more likely when the surface dewpoint is 55 F or higher, all else being equal. Low dewpoint values inhibit sufficient latent heat release and significantly reduce the tornado threat.\nTornadoes are more likely when the LCL is relatively low as compared to relatively high. The depth of moisture in the lower troposphere and the rate of moisture advection are also important to examine.\nWhile a lack of moisture in the lower troposphere reduces the severe storm threat, a lack of moisture in the middle troposphere is helpful to the severe storm threat if there is abundant moisture in the lower troposphere. Convective (potential) instability is present in this situation.\nThe advection of higher dew point values into the boundary layer can increase instability in a severe weather situation. This is often accomplished by advection from a warm ocean source.\nThere are different types of instability and each one of these will be discussed. The release of instability causes air to accelerate in the vertical. This is the reason air rises so quickly to form thunderstorms. Instability is a condition in which air will rise freely on its own due to positive buoyancy. As an example, imagine a basketball at the bottom of a swimming pool. Once the basketball is released it accelerates upward to the top of the pool. The basketball rises because it is less dense than the water surrounding it. A similar process occurs when instability is released in the atmosphere. Air in the lower troposphere is lifted until it becomes less dense than surrounding air. Once it is less dense it rises on its own. The speed that is rises depends on the density difference between the air rising and the surrounding air. In any thunderstorm, rising motion is occurring since that air rising in the updraft of the storm is less dense than the surrounding air.\nParcel instability (also called Static Instability) is assessed by examining CAPE and/or the Lifted Index. Two common measures of CAPE are SBCAPE (surface based CAPE) and MUCAPE (most unstable CAPE). CAPE of 1,500 J/kg is large with values above 2,500 J/kg being extremely large instability.

Water evaporates from the Earth's surface and rises on warm updrafts into the atmosphere. It condenses into clouds, is blown by the wind, and then falls back to the Earth as rain or snow. This cycle is one important way that heat and energy are transferred from the surface of the Earth to the atmosphere, and transported from one place to another on our planet.\nWater vapor is also the most important greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Heat radiated from Earth's surface is absorbed by water vapor molecules in the lower atmosphere. The water vapor molecules, in turn, radiate heat in all directions. Some of the heat returns to the Earth's surface. Thus, water vapor is a second source of warmth (in addition to sunlight) at the Earth's surface.\nThese maps show the average amount of water vapor in a column of atmosphere in a given month. The units are given in centimeters, which is the equivalent amount of water that could be produced if all the water vapor in the column were to condense. The lowest amounts of water vapor (0 centimeters) appear in white, and the highest amounts (6 centimeters) appear in dark blue. Areas of missing data appear in shades of gray. The maps are based on data collected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor on NASA's Aqua satellite.\nThe most noticeable pattern in the time series is the influence of seasonal temperature changes and incoming sunlight on water vapor. In the tropics, a band of extremely humid air wobbles north and south of the equator as the seasons change. This band of humidity is part of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, where the easterly trade winds from each hemisphere converge and produce near-daily thunderstorms and clouds. Farther from the equator, water vapor concentrations are high in the hemisphere experiencing summer and low in the one experiencing winter.\nAnother pattern that shows up in the time series is that water vapor amounts over land areas decrease more in winter months than adjacent ocean areas do. This is largely because air temperatures over land drop more in the winter than temperatures over the ocean. Water vapor condenses more rapidly in colder air.\nView and download more of these data from NASA Earth Observations (NEO): Water Vapor\nWhen fuels such as coal, wood, and oil burn incompletely, they produce carbon monoxide.

Additionally, there is a fourth ingredient (WIND SHEAR) for severe thunderstorms and each are covered separately and in-depth farther down:\nAs a general rule, the surface dewpoint needs to be 55 degrees Fahrenheit or greater for a surface based thunderstorm to occur. A dewpoint of less than this is unfavorable for thunderstorms because the moist adiabatic lapse rate has more stable parcel lapse rate at colder dewpoints. Dewpoints at the surface can be less than 55 degrees Fahrenheit in the case of elevated thunderstorms.\nInstability also decreases as low-level moisture decreases. Instability occurs when a parcel of air is warmer than the environmental air and rises on its own due to positive buoyancy. Instability is often expressed using positive CAPE or negative LI values. Instability is what allows air in the low levels of the atmosphere to rise into the upper levels of the atmosphere. Without instability, the atmosphere will not support deep convection and thunderstorms. Instability can be increased through daytime heating. Lift is what gives a parcel of air the impetus to rise from the low levels of the atmosphere to the elevation where positive buoyancy is realized. Very often, instability will exist in the middle and upper levels of the troposphere but not in the lower troposphere. Low level stability is often referred to as negative CAPE, convective inhibition, or the cap.\nIt is lift that allows air in the low levels of the troposphere to overcome low level convective inhibition. Lift is often referred to as a trigger mechanism. There are many lift mechanisms. A list of many of them follows: fronts, low level convergence, low level WAA, low level moisture advection, mesoscale convergence boundaries such as outflow and sea breeze boundaries, orographic upslope, frictional convergence, vorticity, and jet streak. All these processes force the air to rise. The region that has the greatest combination of these lift mechanisms is often the location that storms first develop. Moisture and instability must also be considered. A thunderstorm will form first and develop toward the region that has the best combination of: high PBL moisture, low convective inhibition, CAPE and lifting mechanisms.\nThe difference between a thunderstorm and a severe thunderstorm is the wind field. For a severe thunderstorm, the ingredients that must be present are moisture, instability, lift and strong speed and directional storm relative wind shear. Ideally, wind will have a veering directional change of 60 degrees or more from the surface to 700 millibars, upper level winds will be greater than 70 knots, and the 850 to 700 mb winds (low level jet) will be 25 knots or greater. Wind shear aids in the following: Tilting a storm (displacing updraft from downdraft), allows the updraft to sustain itself for a longer period of time, allows the development of a mesocyclone, and allows rotating air to be ingested into the updraft (tornadogenesis).\nSevere storms also tend to have these characteristics over ordinary thunderstorms: higher CAPE, drier air in the middle levels of the atmosphere (convective instability), better moisture convergence, baroclinic atmosphere, and more powerful lift.\nLow level moisture is assessed by examining boundary layer dewpoints. Severe thunderstorms are more likely when the surface dewpoint is 55 F or higher, all else being equal. Low dewpoint values inhibit sufficient latent heat release and significantly reduce the tornado threat.\nTornadoes are more likely when the LCL is relatively low as compared to relatively high. The depth of moisture in the lower troposphere and the rate of moisture advection are also important to examine.\nWhile a lack of moisture in the lower troposphere reduces the severe storm threat, a lack of moisture in the middle troposphere is helpful to the severe storm threat if there is abundant moisture in the lower troposphere. Convective (potential) instability is present in this situation.\nThe advection of higher dew point values into the boundary layer can increase instability in a severe weather situation. This is often accomplished by advection from a warm ocean source.\nThere are different types of instability and each one of these will be discussed. The release of instability causes air to accelerate in the vertical. This is the reason air rises so quickly to form thunderstorms. Instability is a condition in which air will rise freely on its own due to positive buoyancy. As an example, imagine a basketball at the bottom of a swimming pool. Once the basketball is released it accelerates upward to the top of the pool. The basketball rises because it is less dense than the water surrounding it. A similar process occurs when instability is released in the atmosphere. Air in the lower troposphere is lifted until it becomes less dense than surrounding air. Once it is less dense it rises on its own. The speed that is rises depends on the density difference between the air rising and the surrounding air. In any thunderstorm, rising motion is occurring since that air rising in the updraft of the storm is less dense than the surrounding air.\nParcel instability (also called Static Instability) is assessed by examining CAPE and/or the Lifted Index. Two common measures of CAPE are SBCAPE (surface based CAPE) and MUCAPE (most unstable CAPE). CAPE of 1,500 J/kg is large with values above 2,500 J/kg being extremely large instability. LI values less than -4 are large with values less than -7 representing extreme instability. High instability allows for high accelerations within of the updraft. A strong updraft is important to hail generation.\nThis is instability caused by the release of latent heat. Latent instability increases as the average dewpoint in the PBL, or in the region that lifting begins, increases. The more latent heat that is released, the more\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Traditional forecasts rely on ground-based radar systems, which are space-constrained and have high maintenance costs. Consequently, most developing countries depend on a global numerical model with low resolution, instead of operating their own radar systems. To mitigate this gap, we propose the Neural Precipitation Model (NPM), which uses global-scale geostationary satellite imagery. NPM predicts precipitation for up to six hours, with an update every hour. We take three key channels to discriminate rain clouds as input: infrared radiation (at a wavelength of 10.5 \u03bc \u2062 m ), upper- (6.3 \u03bc \u2062 m ), and lower- (7.3 \u03bc \u2062 m ) level water vapor channels. Additionally, NPM introduces positional encoders to capture seasonal and temporal patterns, accounting for variations in precipitation. Our experimental results demonstrate that NPM can predict rainfall in real-time with a resolution of 2 km. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/seominseok0429/Data-driven-Precipitation-Nowcasting-Using-Satellite-Imagery.\nAs global warming accelerates, the damage caused by natural disasters is on the rise. Particularly with increasing temperatures, the intensity of extreme precipitation events escalates (Ombadi et al. 2023), leading to significant human casualties due to disasters such as floods, landslides, and soil erosion. To mitigate the loss of life from these disasters, accurate and real-time precipitation forecasting is essential.\nTraditionally, precipitation forecasting relies on various observational equipment such as radar systems and numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. For instance, the HRRR model (Dowell et al. 2022) utilizes radar data, satellite data, surface observations, aircraft data, weather buoys and ships, model initialization data, and fire/smoke data to provide forecasts at a resolution of approximately 3 km. Additionally, global NWP models such as ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) (Hersbach et al. 2020) and integrated forecasting system (IFS) (Wedi et al. 2015) perform forecasts at a resolution of around 25 km.\nDespite advancements in the observational equipment and the NWP models, essential tools for precipitation forecasting involve installation and maintenance costs that can reach about billions of dollars. Furthermore, algorithms like IFS and ERA5 require supercomputers, making them challenging to operate in countries with limited budgets and resources.\nTo overcome these issues, numerous data-driven weather forecasting methods have been proposed. Pangu-Weather (Bi et al. 2023) and GraphCast (Lam et al. 2023) demonstrate superior performance compared to traditional NWP models like IFS, even when running in a single GPU environment. Similarly, a series of MetNet (Andrychowicz et al. 2023; S\u00f8nderby et al. 2020) shows high accuracy in precipitation forecasting while also operating efficiently on a single GPU. However, these global weather forecasting models still rely on NWP data for their initial conditions, meaning they have not fully eliminated the dependency on supercomputers. Additionally, with a resolution of 25 km, they remain insufficient for predicting localized heavy rainfall events, such as flash floods.\nThe MetNet series and various radar-to-radar benchmark (Veillette, Samsi, and Mattioli 2020) models take radar data as input, and produce radar-based outputs, making radar infrastructure essential. Moreover, radar-to-radar models are unable to detect developing precipitation types that do not appear in radar signals yet, further reducing their effectiveness in certain situations.\nTo address the challenges of supercomputer dependency, radar-only systems, and the difficulty of predicting precipitation without prior radar signals, we propose the real-time neural precipitation model (NPM). In addition, to train our NPM model, we introduce the Geostationary Satellite-to-Radar dataset, which is called Sat2Rdr. Our approach is inspired by traditional methods of predicting precipitation using atmospheric states and cloud characteristics from satellite imagery, which have historically relied on the correlation between cloud-top brightness temperature and surface rainfall rates (Arkin 1979; Sorooshian et al. 2000; Huffman et al. 2010). The dataset utilizes the Infrared (IR) channel at 10.5 \u03bc \u2062 m , the Water Vapor (WV) channel at 6.3 \u03bc \u2062 m , and the WV channel at 7.3 \u03bc \u2062 m \u2014channels closely linked to precipitation in traditional algorithms.\nOur NPM consists of two stages: The first stage predicts satellite images showing the formation and dissipation of clouds associated with precipitation. The second stage estimates rainfall from the predicted satellite images, accurately predicting rain rates by analyzing cloud type and growth stage through infrared and water vapor channels.\nSince the NPM relies solely on satellite imagery, it does not inherently predict seasonal or diurnal precipitation patterns. To overcome this, we incorporate day and hour positional embeddings into the NPM, allowing it to learn these patterns. As shown in Figure 1 from the Papua New Guinea flood case, NPM is capable of forecasting precipitation even in regions without radar coverage, as it uses only satellite imagery and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data as input.\nWe validate the effectiveness of our NPM using various video prediction models on the geostationa\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The first is a dissipating thunderstorm or shower. Second, the midlevel atmospheric environment must be hot and dry, combined with a shallow surface inversion. Thunderstorms develop when moist, unstable air is given a nudge upward. Moisture in the cloud condenses and later falls as precipitation. Once the thunderstorm loses its updraft, the thunderstorm is said to be downdraft dominated. When this occurs with a hot and dry atmospheric midlevel in place, the moisture associated with the downdraft evaporates and initially cools this layer, increasing its rate of descent toward the surface. However, the descending air will stop cooling once all the moisture has evaporated, therefore causing adiabatic (compressional) warming and mixing of the warm (inversion) layer. The heat burst will occur once the warm and dry air descends to the surface.\nWhen and where do they typically occur?\nHeat bursts generally occur in the late spring and summer seasons. Spring and summertime thunderstorm activity is generally associated with daytime heating, and these said thunderstorms begin to dissipate during the evening hours because they lose their main source of energy. Accordingly, you can usually expect heat bursts to occur in the evening or overnight hours.\nIn New Mexico, heat bursts are most common across the eastern plains. Thunderstorms tend to roll off the higher terrain during the afternoon hours and across the plains during the evening and overnight periods. Generally, a surface inversion will already be in place once thunderstorms begin to dissipate. It is possible for heat bursts to occur west of the central mountain chain if the appropriate conditions are in place, however, a sparse surface observations make it difficult to quantify such events.\nWhat are the effects of a Heat Burst?\nHeat bursts cause a rapid increase in surface temperature, a substantial decrease in surface dewpoint, and on some occasions damaging winds. Recorded temperatures have been known to exceed 100 degrees. This was the case in Wichita, Kansas shortly after midnight on June 9, 2011. The temperature rose from 85 degrees at 1222 am to 102 degrees at 1242 am. Wind speeds have also been known to exceed 70 or 80 mph, as was the case near Clovis, New Mexico below. Winds associated with heat bursts have the potential to rip roofs off buildings, damage trees, or just relocate lawn furniture.\nExamples of Heat Bursts in New Mexico\nOn June 3, 2011, the Cannon Air Force Base (KCVS) recorded a wind gust of 90 mph (78 knots) at 0230Z (8:30 pm MDT). No severe thunderstorms were in the area, only lingering showers from earlier thunderstorm activity. The 90 mph wind gust was caused by a heat burst. At 755 pm, the temperature at KCVS was 71\u00b0F and 35 minutes later it jumped to 77\u00b0F, which correlates to the onset of the strong winds. KCVS also recorded a drop in dewpoint temperature from 50\u00b0F to 43\u00b0F during the same time frame.\nThe 90 mph wind gust was recorded at 0230z, just 1 minute prior to the reflectivity (left) and velocity (right) images from the Cannon AFB radar (KFDX) below. The thick white lines in the images are county borders., and velocities are in knots. The reflectivity image clearly shows light showery precipitation in a serpentine (thin, snake-like) structure (though not shown, the weak reflectivities snaked well into Texas). This type of reflectivity structure is common during heat bursts. However, in the velocity image, there is no indication that there were winds anywhere near 90 mph. This shows that the impact from heat bursts can be very localized, and hard to warn for.\nBelow is a graph of the observations at Cannon Air Force Base on June 3, 2011, illustrating the temperature increase and associated dew point decrease (described above) at the time of the heat burst (purple box).\nAnother strong heat burst occurred almost 6 hours later near Clayton. This time, however, the temperature rose a whopping 14 degrees in the middle of the night. Between 1255 and 155 am, the temperature jumped from 63 to 77 degrees, while the dewpoint dropped from 46 to 36 degrees. The wind gust at the Clayton ASOS peaked at 56 knots (64 mph). This rather unique event was described in a separate feature, available here.\nAround 951 pm MDT (0351Z) on June 19, 2011, a possible heat burst occurred west of the central mountains. The Albuquerque radar (KABX) reflectivity images (loop below) show a prominent snake-like structure (or radar signature) to the showers west of Cuba. Unfortunately, the lack of surface observations in this area of New Mexico cannot prove or deny that a heat burst occurred. However, at the Mesa Chivato RAWS site, approximately 15 miles southeast of the the radar signature, the temperature increased 4 degrees, from 63 to 67, between 851 and 951 pm, though the dewpoint only decreased one degree over this time frame.\nCURRENT HAZARDS Outlooks Submit A Storm Report Severe and Hazardous Weather Info\nCURRENT CONDITIONS Surface Observations Observed Precipitation Satellite Local Satellite Page Local Observations Page Map of Latest Wind and Precipitation Reports\nRADAR National Radar ABX Albuquerque Radar FDX Cannon Air Force Base Radar\nFORECASTS Fire Weather Forecasts Area Forecast Discussion Hourly View Forecast Activity Planner Aviation Forecasts Local Forecast Page Graphical Forecasts\nHYDROLOGY Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Services Local Hydrology Products\nCLIMATE AND PAST WEATHER Climate Graphs Drought Severe T-Storm Climatology for NM Local Data Winter Climatology for NM NOAA Climate Center Climate Prediction Center\nLOCAL PROGRAMS About Our Office SKYWARN NOAA We\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Water evaporates from the Earth's surface and rises on warm updrafts into the atmosphere. It condenses into clouds, is blown by the wind, and then falls back to the Earth as rain or snow. This cycle is one important way that heat and energy are transferred from the surface of the Earth to the atmosphere, and transported from one place to another on our planet.\nWater vapor is also the most important greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Heat radiated from Earth's surface is absorbed by water vapor molecules in the lower atmosphere. The water vapor molecules, in turn, radiate heat in all directions. Some of the heat returns to the Earth's surface. Thus, water vapor is a second source of warmth (in addition to sunlight) at the Earth's surface.\nThese maps show the average amount of water vapor in a column of atmosphere in a given month. The units are given in centimeters, which is the equivalent amount of water that could be produced if all the water vapor in the column were to condense. The lowest amounts of water vapor (0 centimeters) appear in white, and the highest amounts (6 centimeters) appear in dark blue. Areas of missing data appear in shades of gray. The maps are based on data collected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor on NASA's Aqua satellite.\nThe most noticeable pattern in the time series is the influence of seasonal temperature changes and incoming sunlight on water vapor. In the tropics, a band of extremely humid air wobbles north and south of the equator as the seasons change. This band of humidity is part of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, where the easterly trade winds from each hemisphere converge and produce near-daily thunderstorms and clouds. Farther from the equator, water vapor concentrations are high in the hemisphere experiencing summer and low in the one experiencing winter.\nAnother pattern that shows up in the time series is that water vapor amounts over land areas decrease more in winter months than adjacent ocean areas do. This is largely because air temperatures over land drop more in the winter than temperatures over the ocean. Water vapor condenses more rapidly in colder air.\nView and download more of these data from NASA Earth Observations (NEO): Water Vapor\nWhen fuels such as coal, wood, and oil burn incompletely, they produce carbon monoxide.

Traditional forecasts rely on ground-based radar systems, which are space-constrained and have high maintenance costs. Consequently, most developing countries depend on a global numerical model with low resolution, instead of operating their own radar systems. To mitigate this gap, we propose the Neural Precipitation Model (NPM), which uses global-scale geostationary satellite imagery. NPM predicts precipitation for up to six hours, with an update every hour. We take three key channels to discriminate rain clouds as input: infrared radiation (at a wavelength of 10.5 \u03bc \u2062 m ), upper- (6.3 \u03bc \u2062 m ), and lower- (7.3 \u03bc \u2062 m ) level water vapor channels. Additionally, NPM introduces positional encoders to capture seasonal and temporal patterns, accounting for variations in precipitation. Our experimental results demonstrate that NPM can predict rainfall in real-time with a resolution of 2 km. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/seominseok0429/Data-driven-Precipitation-Nowcasting-Using-Satellite-Imagery.\nAs global warming accelerates, the damage caused by natural disasters is on the rise. Particularly with increasing temperatures, the intensity of extreme precipitation events escalates (Ombadi et al. 2023), leading to significant human casualties due to disasters such as floods, landslides, and soil erosion. To mitigate the loss of life from these disasters, accurate and real-time precipitation forecasting is essential.\nTraditionally, precipitation forecasting relies on various observational equipment such as radar systems and numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. For instance, the HRRR model (Dowell et al. 2022) utilizes radar data, satellite data, surface observations, aircraft data, weather buoys and ships, model initialization data, and fire/smoke data to provide forecasts at a resolution of approximately 3 km. Additionally, global NWP models such as ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) (Hersbach et al. 2020) and integrated forecasting system (IFS) (Wedi et al. 2015) perform forecasts at a resolution of around 25 km.\nDespite advancements in the observational equipment and the NWP models, essential tools for precipitation forecasting involve installation and maintenance costs that can reach about billions of dollars. Furthermore, algorithms like IFS and ERA5 require supercomputers, making them challenging to operate in countries with limited budgets and resources.\nTo overcome these issues, numerous data-driven weather forecasting methods have been proposed. Pangu-Weather (Bi et al. 2023) and GraphCast (Lam et al. 2023) demonstrate superior performance compared to traditional NWP models like IFS, even when running in a single GPU environment. Similarly, a series of MetNet (Andrychowicz et al. 2023; S\u00f8nderby et al. 2020) shows high accuracy in precipitation forecasting while also operating efficiently on a single GPU. However, these global weather forecasting models still rely on NWP data for their initial conditions, meaning they have not fully eliminated the dependency on supercomputers. Additionally, with a resolution of 25 km, they remain insufficient for predicting localized heavy rainfall events, such as flash floods.\nThe MetNet series and various radar-to-radar benchmark (Veillette, Samsi, and Mattioli 2020) models take radar data as input, and produce radar-based outputs, making radar infrastructure essential. Moreover, radar-to-radar models are unable to detect developing precipitation types that do not appear in radar signals yet, further reducing their effectiveness in certain situations.\nTo address the challenges of supercomputer dependency, radar-only systems, and the difficulty of predicting precipitation without prior radar signals, we propose the real-time neural precipitation model (NPM). In addition, to train our NPM model, we introduce the Geostationary Satellite-to-Radar dataset, which is called Sat2Rdr. Our approach is inspired by traditional methods of predicting precipitation using atmospheric states and cloud characteristics from satellite imagery, which have historically relied on the correlation between cloud-top brightness temperature and surface rainfall rates (Arkin 1979; Sorooshian et al. 2000; Huffman et al. 2010). The dataset utilizes the Infrared (IR) channel at 10.5 \u03bc \u2062 m , the Water Vapor (WV) channel at 6.3 \u03bc \u2062 m , and the WV channel at 7.3 \u03bc \u2062 m \u2014channels closely linked to precipitation in traditional algorithms.\nOur NPM consists of two stages: The first stage predicts satellite images showing the formation and dissipation of clouds associated with precipitation. The second stage estimates rainfall from the predicted satellite images, accurately predicting rain rates by analyzing cloud type and growth stage through infrared and water vapor channels.\nSince the NPM relies solely on satellite imagery, it does not inherently predict seasonal or diurnal precipitation patterns. To overcome this, we incorporate day and hour positional embeddings into the NPM, allowing it to learn these patterns. As shown in Figure 1 from the Papua New Guinea flood case, NPM is capable of forecasting precipitation even in regions without radar coverage, as it uses only satellite imagery and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data as input.\nWe validate the effectiveness of our NPM using various video prediction models on the geostationa\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The first is a dissipating thunderstorm or shower. Second, the midlevel atmospheric environment must be hot and dry, combined with a shallow surface inversion. Thunderstorms develop when moist, unstable air is given a nudge upward. Moisture in the cloud condenses and later falls as precipitation. Once the thunderstorm loses its updraft, the thunderstorm is said to be downdraft dominated. When this occurs with a hot and dry atmospheric midlevel in place, the moisture associated with the downdraft evaporates and initially cools this layer, increasing its rate of descent toward the surface. However, the descending air will stop cooling once all the moisture has evaporated, therefore causing adiabatic (compressional) warming and mixing of the warm (inversion) layer. The heat burst will occur once the warm and dry air descends to the surface.\nWhen and where do they typically occur?\nHeat bursts generally occur in the late spring and summer seasons. Spring and summertime thunderstorm activity is generally associated with daytime heating, and these said thunderstorms begin to dissipate during the evening hours because they lose their main source of energy. Accordingly, you can usually expect heat bursts to occur in the evening or overnight hours.\nIn New Mexico, heat bursts are most common across the eastern plains. Thunderstorms tend to roll off the higher terrain during the afternoon hours and across the plains during the evening and overnight periods. Generally, a surface inversion will already be in place once thunderstorms begin to dissipate. It is possible for heat bursts to occur west of the central mountain chain if the appropriate conditions are in place, however, a sparse surface observations make it difficult to quantify such events.\nWhat are the effects of a Heat Burst?\nHeat bursts cause a rapid increase in surface temperature, a substantial decrease in surface dewpoint, and on some occasions damaging winds. Recorded temperatures have been known to exceed 100 degrees. This was the case in Wichita, Kansas shortly after midnight on June 9, 2011. The temperature rose from 85 degrees at 1222 am to 102 degrees at 1242 am. Wind speeds have also been known to exceed 70 or 80 mph, as was the case near Clovis, New Mexico below. Winds associated with heat bursts have the potential to rip roofs off buildings, damage trees, or just relocate lawn furniture.\nExamples of Heat Bursts in New Mexico\nOn June 3, 2011, the Cannon Air Force Base (KCVS) recorded a wind gust of 90 mph (78 knots) at 0230Z (8:30 pm MDT). No severe thunderstorms were in the area, only lingering showers from earlier thunderstorm activity. The 90 mph wind gust was caused by a heat burst. At 755 pm, the temperature at KCVS was 71\u00b0F and 35 minutes later it jumped to 77\u00b0F, which correlates to the onset of the strong winds. KCVS also recorded a drop in dewpoint temperature from 50\u00b0F to 43\u00b0F during the same time frame.\nThe 90 mph wind gust was recorded at 0230z, just 1 minute prior to the reflectivity (left) and velocity (right) images from the Cannon AFB radar (KFDX) below. The thick white lines in the images are county borders., and velocities are in knots. The reflectivity image clearly shows light showery precipitation in a serpentine (thin, snake-like) structure (though not shown, the weak reflectivities snaked well into Texas). This type of reflectivity structure is common during heat bursts. However, in the velocity image, there is no indication that there were winds anywhere near 90 mph. This shows that the impact from heat bursts can be very localized, and hard to warn for.\nBelow is a graph of the observations at Cannon Air Force Base on June 3, 2011, illustrating the temperature increase and associated dew point decrease (described above) at the time of the heat burst (purple box).\nAnother strong heat burst occurred almost 6 hours later near Clayton. This time, however, the temperature rose a whopping 14 degrees in the middle of the night. Between 1255 and 155 am, the temperature jumped from 63 to 77 degrees, while the dewpoint dropped from 46 to 36 degrees. The wind gust at the Clayton ASOS peaked at 56 knots (64 mph). This rather unique event was described in a separate feature, available here.\nAround 951 pm MDT (0351Z) on June 19, 2011, a possible heat burst occurred west of the central mountains. The Albuquerque radar (KABX) reflectivity images (loop below) show a prominent snake-like structure (or radar signature) to the showers west of Cuba. Unfortunately, the lack of surface observations in this area of New Mexico cannot prove or deny that a heat burst occurred. However, at the Mesa Chivato RAWS site, approximately 15 miles southeast of the the radar signature, the temperature increased 4 degrees, from 63 to 67, between 851 and 951 pm, though the dewpoint only decreased one degree over this time frame.\nCURRENT HAZARDS Outlooks Submit A Storm Report Severe and Hazardous Weather Info\nCURRENT CONDITIONS Surface Observations Observed Precipitation Satellite Local Satellite Page Local Observations Page Map of Latest Wind and Precipitation Reports\nRADAR National Radar ABX Albuquerque Radar FDX Cannon Air Force Base Radar\nFORECASTS Fire Weather Forecasts Area Forecast Discussion Hourly View Forecast Activity Planner Aviation Forecasts Local Forecast Page Graphical Forecasts\nHYDROLOGY Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Services Local Hydrology Products\nCLIMATE AND PAST WEATHER Climate Graphs Drought Severe T-Storm Climatology for NM Local Data Winter Climatology for NM NOAA Climate Center Climate Prediction Center\nLOCAL PROGRAMS About Our Office SKYWARN NOAA We\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

It condenses into clouds, is blown by the wind, and then falls back to the Earth as rain or snow. This cycle is one important way that heat and energy are transferred from the surface of the Earth to the atmosphere, and transported from one place to another on our planet.\nWater vapor is also the most important greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Heat radiated from Earth's surface is absorbed by water vapor molecules in the lower atmosphere. The water vapor molecules, in turn, radiate heat in all directions. Some of the heat returns to the Earth's surface. Thus, water vapor is a second source of warmth (in addition to sunlight) at the Earth's surface.\nThese maps show the average amount of water vapor in a column of atmosphere in a given month. The units are given in centimeters, which is the equivalent amount of water that could be produced if all the water vapor in the column were to condense. The lowest amounts of water vapor (0 centimeters) appear in white, and the highest amounts (6 centimeters) appear in dark blue. Areas of missing data appear in shades of gray. The maps are based on data collected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor on NASA's Aqua satellite.\nThe most noticeable pattern in the time series is the influence of seasonal temperature changes and incoming sunlight on water vapor. In the tropics, a band of extremely humid air wobbles north and south of the equator as the seasons change. This band of humidity is part of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, where the easterly trade winds from each hemisphere converge and produce near-daily thunderstorms and clouds. Farther from the equator, water vapor concentrations are high in the hemisphere experiencing summer and low in the one experiencing winter.\nAnother pattern that shows up in the time series is that water vapor amounts over land areas decrease more in winter months than adjacent ocean areas do. This is largely because air temperatures over land drop more in the winter than temperatures over the ocean.

Traditional forecasts rely on ground-based radar systems, which are space-constrained and have high maintenance costs. Consequently, most developing countries depend on a global numerical model with low resolution, instead of operating their own radar systems. To mitigate this gap, we propose the Neural Precipitation Model (NPM), which uses global-scale geostationary satellite imagery. NPM predicts precipitation for up to six hours, with an update every hour. We take three key channels to discriminate rain clouds as input: infrared radiation (at a wavelength of 10.5 \u03bc \u2062 m ), upper- (6.3 \u03bc \u2062 m ), and lower- (7.3 \u03bc \u2062 m ) level water vapor channels. Additionally, NPM introduces positional encoders to capture seasonal and temporal patterns, accounting for variations in precipitation. Our experimental results demonstrate that NPM can predict rainfall in real-time with a resolution of 2 km. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/seominseok0429/Data-driven-Precipitation-Nowcasting-Using-Satellite-Imagery.\nAs global warming accelerates, the damage caused by natural disasters is on the rise. Particularly with increasing temperatures, the intensity of extreme precipitation events escalates (Ombadi et al. 2023), leading to significant human casualties due to disasters such as floods, landslides, and soil erosion. To mitigate the loss of life from these disasters, accurate and real-time precipitation forecasting is essential.\nTraditionally, precipitation forecasting relies on various observational equipment such as radar systems and numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. For instance, the HRRR model (Dowell et al. 2022) utilizes radar data, satellite data, surface observations, aircraft data, weather buoys and ships, model initialization data, and fire/smoke data to provide forecasts at a resolution of approximately 3 km. Additionally, global NWP models such as ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) (Hersbach et al. 2020) and integrated forecasting system (IFS) (Wedi et al. 2015) perform forecasts at a resolution of around 25 km.\nDespite advancements in the observational equipment and the NWP models, essential tools for precipitation forecasting involve installation and maintenance costs that can reach about billions of dollars. Furthermore, algorithms like IFS and ERA5 require supercomputers, making them challenging to operate in countries with limited budgets and resources.\nTo overcome these issues, numerous data-driven weather forecasting methods have been proposed. Pangu-Weather (Bi et al. 2023) and GraphCast (Lam et al. 2023) demonstrate superior performance compared to traditional NWP models like IFS, even when running in a single GPU environment. Similarly, a series of MetNet (Andrychowicz et al. 2023; S\u00f8nderby et al. 2020) shows high accuracy in precipitation forecasting while also operating efficiently on a single GPU. However, these global weather forecasting models still rely on NWP data for their initial conditions, meaning they have not fully eliminated the dependency on supercomputers. Additionally, with a resolution of 25 km, they remain insufficient for predicting localized heavy rainfall events, such as flash floods.\nThe MetNet series and various radar-to-radar benchmark (Veillette, Samsi, and Mattioli 2020) models take radar data as input, and produce radar-based outputs, making radar infrastructure essential. Moreover, radar-to-radar models are unable to detect developing precipitation types that do not appear in radar signals yet, further reducing their effectiveness in certain situations.\nTo address the challenges of supercomputer dependency, radar-only systems, and the difficulty of predicting precipitation without prior radar signals, we propose the real-time neural precipitation model (NPM). In addition, to train our NPM model, we introduce the Geostationary Satellite-to-Radar dataset, which is called Sat2Rdr. Our approach is inspired by traditional methods of predicting precipitation using atmospheric states and cloud characteristics from satellite imagery, which have historically relied on the correlation between cloud-top brightness temperature and surface rainfall rates (Arkin 1979; Sorooshian et al. 2000; Huffman et al. 2010). The dataset utilizes the Infrared (IR) channel at 10.5 \u03bc \u2062 m , the Water Vapor (WV) channel at 6.3 \u03bc \u2062 m , and the WV channel at 7.3 \u03bc \u2062 m \u2014channels closely linked to precipitation in traditional algorithms.\nOur NPM consists of two stages: The first stage predicts satellite images showing the formation and dissipation of clouds associated with precipitation. The second stage estimates rainfall from the predicted satellite images, accurately predicting rain rates by analyzing cloud type and growth stage through infrared and water vapor channels.\nSince the NPM relies solely on satellite imagery, it does not inherently predict seasonal or diurnal precipitation patterns. To overcome this, we incorporate day and hour positional embeddings into the NPM, allowing it to learn these patterns. As shown in Figure 1 from the Papua New Guinea flood case, NPM is capable of forecasting precipitation even in regions without radar coverage, as it uses only satellite imagery and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data as input.\nWe validate the effectiveness of our NPM using various video prediction models on the geostationa\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The storm reached hurricane status as it entered the Gulf of Mexico, making landfall in Mobile, AL at Category 3 strength on July 5. As is the case with many tropical cyclones, intensity drastically decreased soon after landfall. However, the system remained intact for several days, taking a very slow and winding trek over the Southeast. Eventually coming to linger over the Southern Appalachian mountains, the storm brought several inches of rain to western North Carolina for over a week \u2014 most notably on July 8-10 \u2014 saturating soils and filling stream banks to the brim.\nAs rains from the Gulf Coast storm began tapering off, another storm brewing in the Atlantic made its journey toward the eastern U.S. This storm made landfall on July 14, 1916 near Charleston, SC as a Category 2 hurricane, and traipsed across the state on a northwestern track. While many tropical cyclones often take a more northeastern course once they reach higher latitudes, a large area of high pressure over the New England states prevented such a track, forcing the storm in the direction of the Southern Appalachians. In the morning hours of Saturday, July 15, heavy rain from the storm began to fall across North Carolina, stretching from the eastern foothills to the Blue Ridge Mountains. By Sunday, precipitation totals in western NC ranged from 5 inches to over 20 inches.\nThe storm\u2019s northwesterly track, along with the orientation of winds, lined up almost exactly perpendicular to the peaks in the northern mountains, putting this area in a prime location for upsloping. As a result, a weather station in Altapass measured 22.22 inches of rain from 2:00pm July 15 to 2:00pm July 16, shattering the U.S. record for the most rainfall within 24 hours at that time. While this U.S. record has since been broken and currently stands with a station in Texas, Altapass still holds the statewide record for most rainfall observed in a 24-hour period.\nBut the story still wasn\u2019t over. With the ground thoroughly soaked, and lakes and streams already at capacity as a result of the tremendous amount of rain observed in the weeks prior, the water had nowhere to go \u2014 and soon unleashed its fury across the region.\nThe French Broad River quickly became inundated as the raging waters flowed into the heart of Asheville at high speeds and volumes never-before experienced. Upon colliding with the Swannanoa, floodwaters rapidly overtook Biltmore Village, resulting in one of the worst incidents of flooding that area has ever seen. A streamflow gauge along the French Broad reached a stage of 18.6 feet at 9:00am on July 16. By 10:00am, the bridge to which the gauge was attached was completely destroyed, and water continued to rise to an estimated 21 feet \u2014 10.4 feet above the record flood at that time.\nMeanwhile the Catawba River was experiencing its own turmoil. A streamflow gauge in Mount Holly reached an estimated stage of 45.5 feet (almost double the record previously set in 1901) \u2014 an estimate, mind you, due to the fact that this gauge, too, had been completed washed away by the torrential waters.\nLandslides were observed left and right as the floodwaters engulfed the region. Homes and business were swept away; crops were completely wiped out; numerous bridges and mills were demolished; and several railroad lines were severely damaged. In one particular case, a railroad trestle over the Catawba River was completely washed away. The event claimed the lives of more than 80 people overall, including workers with the Southern Railway Company as they attempted cleanup in the days to follow.\nFloodwaters took roughly 2 days to completely recede. Estimated damage costs over the region exceeded $22 million, which equates to roughly $480 million by today\u2019s standards. Perhaps the greatest single loss of property was that of the Southern Railway Company, which suffered damages around $1.2 million as a result of broken railways, shattered roundhouses, and flooded passenger stations. Of course, this figure doesn\u2019t take into account the decreased railroad traffic the company endured, nor the cost they accrued in having to detour trains.\nWhile an exact timeline is unknown, the greater mountain region eventually recovered. Homes that had been destroyed were rebuilt, and industries devastated by the destruction eventually sprang back to life.\nMany people remember a similar flood that rivals the devastation seen in North Carolina back in 1916 \u2014 one that occurred over the same area just over a decade ago. In 2004, western NC was hit repeatedly as two hurricanes \u2014 Frances and Ivan \u2014 trekked over the region with only 9 days separating them. Flood water levels from both the 1916 flood and that of 2004 were nearly identical, as were precipitation totals. The highest rainfall amount reported with Hurricane Frances was 18.1 inches in Linville Falls, while Cruso, NC received the most precipitation from Hurricane Ivan just days later with a 17-inch total.\nAlthough the destruction from the 2004 flood wasn\u2019t as great as the 1916 event, it did take a toll on western North Carolina. Eleven deaths were reported due to the flooding from Frances and Ivan, and damages were estimated at nearly $200 million.\nAnd while other events have threatened the Altapass record from July 1916 \u2014 such as the 18+ inches observed in Southport as Hurricane Floyd passed through in September 1999 \u2014 the torrential rainfall it received in just 24 hours remains unchallenged in North Carolina\u2019s record books.\nSources:\nPublished in Climate Blog, Events.

The first is a dissipating thunderstorm or shower. Second, the midlevel atmospheric environment must be hot and dry, combined with a shallow surface inversion. Thunderstorms develop when moist, unstable air is given a nudge upward. Moisture in the cloud condenses and later falls as precipitation. Once the thunderstorm loses its updraft, the thunderstorm is said to be downdraft dominated. When this occurs with a hot and dry atmospheric midlevel in place, the moisture associated with the downdraft evaporates and initially cools this layer, increasing its rate of descent toward the surface. However, the descending air will stop cooling once all the moisture has evaporated, therefore causing adiabatic (compressional) warming and mixing of the warm (inversion) layer. The heat burst will occur once the warm and dry air descends to the surface.\nWhen and where do they typically occur?\nHeat bursts generally occur in the late spring and summer seasons. Spring and summertime thunderstorm activity is generally associated with daytime heating, and these said thunderstorms begin to dissipate during the evening hours because they lose their main source of energy. Accordingly, you can usually expect heat bursts to occur in the evening or overnight hours.\nIn New Mexico, heat bursts are most common across the eastern plains. Thunderstorms tend to roll off the higher terrain during the afternoon hours and across the plains during the evening and overnight periods. Generally, a surface inversion will already be in place once thunderstorms begin to dissipate. It is possible for heat bursts to occur west of the central mountain chain if the appropriate conditions are in place, however, a sparse surface observations make it difficult to quantify such events.\nWhat are the effects of a Heat Burst?\nHeat bursts cause a rapid increase in surface temperature, a substantial decrease in surface dewpoint, and on some occasions damaging winds. Recorded temperatures have been known to exceed 100 degrees. This was the case in Wichita, Kansas shortly after midnight on June 9, 2011. The temperature rose from 85 degrees at 1222 am to 102 degrees at 1242 am. Wind speeds have also been known to exceed 70 or 80 mph, as was the case near Clovis, New Mexico below. Winds associated with heat bursts have the potential to rip roofs off buildings, damage trees, or just relocate lawn furniture.\nExamples of Heat Bursts in New Mexico\nOn June 3, 2011, the Cannon Air Force Base (KCVS) recorded a wind gust of 90 mph (78 knots) at 0230Z (8:30 pm MDT).

The first is a dissipating thunderstorm or shower. Second, the midlevel atmospheric environment must be hot and dry, combined with a shallow surface inversion. Thunderstorms develop when moist, unstable air is given a nudge upward. Moisture in the cloud condenses and later falls as precipitation. Once the thunderstorm loses its updraft, the thunderstorm is said to be downdraft dominated. When this occurs with a hot and dry atmospheric midlevel in place, the moisture associated with the downdraft evaporates and initially cools this layer, increasing its rate of descent toward the surface. However, the descending air will stop cooling once all the moisture has evaporated, therefore causing adiabatic (compressional) warming and mixing of the warm (inversion) layer. The heat burst will occur once the warm and dry air descends to the surface.\nWhen and where do they typically occur?\nHeat bursts generally occur in the late spring and summer seasons. Spring and summertime thunderstorm activity is generally associated with daytime heating, and these said thunderstorms begin to dissipate during the evening hours because they lose their main source of energy. Accordingly, you can usually expect heat bursts to occur in the evening or overnight hours.\nIn New Mexico, heat bursts are most common across the eastern plains. Thunderstorms tend to roll off the higher terrain during the afternoon hours and across the plains during the evening and overnight periods. Generally, a surface inversion will already be in place once thunderstorms begin to dissipate. It is possible for heat bursts to occur west of the central mountain chain if the appropriate conditions are in place, however, a sparse surface observations make it difficult to quantify such events.\nWhat are the effects of a Heat Burst?\nHeat bursts cause a rapid increase in surface temperature, a substantial decrease in surface dewpoint, and on some occasions damaging winds. Recorded temperatures have been known to exceed 100 degrees. This was the case in Wichita, Kansas shortly after midnight on June 9, 2011. The temperature rose from 85 degrees at 1222 am to 102 degrees at 1242 am. Wind speeds have also been known to exceed 70 or 80 mph, as was the case near Clovis, New Mexico below. Winds associated with heat bursts have the potential to rip roofs off buildings, damage trees, or just relocate lawn furniture.\nExamples of Heat Bursts in New Mexico\nOn June 3, 2011, the Cannon Air Force Base (KCVS) recorded a wind gust of 90 mph (78 knots) at 0230Z (8:30 pm MDT). No severe thunderstorms were in the area, only lingering showers from earlier thunderstorm activity. The 90 mph wind gust was caused by a heat burst.

NASA's AIRS instrument provides information about ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nWater is constantly cycling through the atmosphere. Water evaporates from the Earth's surface and rises on warm updrafts into the atmosphere. It condenses into clouds, is blown by the wind, and then falls back to the Earth as rain or snow. This cycle is one important way that heat and energy are transferred from the surface of the Earth to the atmosphere, and transported from one place to another on our planet.\nWater vapor is also the most important greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Heat radiated from Earth's surface is absorbed by water vapor molecules in the lower atmosphere. The water vapor molecules, in turn, radiate heat in all directions. Some of the heat returns to the Earth's surface. Thus, water vapor is a second source of warmth (in addition to sunlight) at the Earth's surface.\nThese maps show the average amount of water vapor in a column of atmosphere in a given month. The units are given in centimeters, which is the equivalent amount of water that could be produced if all the water vapor in the column were to condense. The lowest amounts of water vapor (0 centimeters) appear in white, and the highest amounts (6 centimeters) appear in dark blue. Areas of missing data appear in shades of gray. The maps are based on data collected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor on NASA's Aqua satellite.\nThe most noticeable pattern in the time series is the influence of seasonal temperature changes and incoming sunlight on water vapor. In the tropics, a band of extremely humid air wobbles north and south of the equator as the seasons change. This band of humidity is part of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, where the easterly trade winds from each hemisphere converge and produce near-daily thunderstorms and clouds. Farther from the equator, water vapor concentrations are high in the hemisphere experiencing summer and low in the one experiencing winter.\nAnother pattern that shows up in the time series is that water vapor amounts over land areas decrease more in winter months than adjacent ocean areas do. This is largely because air temperatures over land drop more in the winter than temperatures over the ocean. Water vapor condenses more rapidly in colder air.\nView and download more of these data from NASA Earth Observations (NEO): Water Vapor\nWhen fuels such as coal, wood, and oil burn incompletely, they produce carbon monoxide.

The heat burst will occur once the warm and dry air descends to the surface.\nWhen and where do they typically occur?\nHeat bursts generally occur in the late spring and summer seasons. Spring and summertime thunderstorm activity is generally associated with daytime heating, and these said thunderstorms begin to dissipate during the evening hours because they lose their main source of energy. Accordingly, you can usually expect heat bursts to occur in the evening or overnight hours.\nIn New Mexico, heat bursts are most common across the eastern plains. Thunderstorms tend to roll off the higher terrain during the afternoon hours and across the plains during the evening and overnight periods. Generally, a surface inversion will already be in place once thunderstorms begin to dissipate. It is possible for heat bursts to occur west of the central mountain chain if the appropriate conditions are in place, however, a sparse surface observations make it difficult to quantify such events.\nWhat are the effects of a Heat Burst?\nHeat bursts cause a rapid increase in surface temperature, a substantial decrease in surface dewpoint, and on some occasions damaging winds. Recorded temperatures have been known to exceed 100 degrees. This was the case in Wichita, Kansas shortly after midnight on June 9, 2011. The temperature rose from 85 degrees at 1222 am to 102 degrees at 1242 am. Wind speeds have also been known to exceed 70 or 80 mph, as was the case near Clovis, New Mexico below. Winds associated with heat bursts have the potential to rip roofs off buildings, damage trees, or just relocate lawn furniture.\nExamples of Heat Bursts in New Mexico\nOn June 3, 2011, the Cannon Air Force Base (KCVS) recorded a wind gust of 90 mph (78 knots) at 0230Z (8:30 pm MDT). No severe thunderstorms were in the area, only lingering showers from earlier thunderstorm activity. The 90 mph wind gust was caused by a heat burst. At 755 pm, the temperature at KCVS was 71\u00b0F and 35 minutes later it jumped to 77\u00b0F, which correlates to the onset of the strong winds. KCVS also recorded a drop in dewpoint temperature from 50\u00b0F to 43\u00b0F during the same time frame.\nThe 90 mph wind gust was recorded at 0230z, just 1 minute prior to the reflectivity (left) and velocity (right) images from the Cannon AFB radar (KFDX) below. The thick white lines in the images are county borders., and velocities are in knots. The reflectivity image clearly shows light showery precipitation in a serpentine (thin, snake-like) structure (though not shown, the weak reflectivities snaked well into Texas). This type of reflectivity structure is common during heat bursts. However, in the velocity image, there is no indication that there were winds anywhere near 90 mph. This shows that the impact from heat bursts can be very localized, and hard to warn for.\nBelow is a graph of the observations at Cannon Air Force Base on June 3, 2011, illustrating the temperature increase and associated dew point decrease (described above) at the time of the heat burst (purple box).\nAnother strong heat burst occurred almost 6 hours later near Clayton. This time, however, the temperature rose a whopping 14 degrees in the middle of the night. Between 1255 and 155 am, the temperature jumped from 63 to 77 degrees, while the dewpoint dropped from 46 to 36 degrees. The wind gust at the Clayton ASOS peaked at 56 knots (64 mph). This rather unique event was described in a separate feature, available here.\nAround 951 pm MDT (0351Z) on June 19, 2011, a possible heat burst occurred west of the central mountains. The Albuquerque radar (KABX) reflectivity images (loop below) show a prominent snake-like structure (or radar signature) to the showers west of Cuba. Unfortunately, the lack of surface observations in this area of New Mexico cannot prove or deny that a heat burst occurred. However, at the Mesa Chivato RAWS site, approximately 15 miles southeast of the the radar signature, the temperature increased 4 degrees, from 63 to 67, between 851 and 951 pm, though the dewpoint only decreased one degree over this time frame.\nCURRENT HAZARDS Outlooks Submit A Storm Report Severe and Hazardous Weather Info\nCURRENT CONDITIONS Surface Observations Observed Precipitation Satellite Local Satellite Page Local Observations Page Map of Latest Wind and Precipitation Reports\nRADAR National Radar ABX Albuquerque Radar FDX Cannon Air Force Base Radar\nFORECASTS Fire Weather Forecasts Area Forecast Discussion Hourly View Forecast Activity Planner Aviation Forecasts Local Forecast Page Graphical Forecasts\nHYDROLOGY Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Services Local Hydrology Products\nCLIMATE AND PAST WEATHER Climate Graphs Drought Severe T-Storm Climatology for NM Local Data Winter Climatology for NM NOAA Climate Center Clim\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The first is a dissipating thunderstorm or shower. Second, the midlevel atmospheric environment must be hot and dry, combined with a shallow surface inversion. Thunderstorms develop when moist, unstable air is given a nudge upward. Moisture in the cloud condenses and later falls as precipitation. Once the thunderstorm loses its updraft, the thunderstorm is said to be downdraft dominated. When this occurs with a hot and dry atmospheric midlevel in place, the moisture associated with the downdraft evaporates and initially cools this layer, increasing its rate of descent toward the surface. However, the descending air will stop cooling once all the moisture has evaporated, therefore causing adiabatic (compressional) warming and mixing of the warm (inversion) layer.

When it's cloudy overnight, the ground retains more of its heat, and not as much heat ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nThe following navigation uses TAB to navigate through link items and ENTER or SPACE to open sub-navigation. Press ESCAPE to close.\nHave you ever woken up in the morning and wondered if it rained overnight because the grass was so wet? Sometimes it isn't rain at all, but a good coating of dew that leaves the grass feeling saturated.\nEssentially, dew is the result of moisture that forms because of condensation, according to National Geographic (Opens in a new window) . At this time of year, dew is just as likely as rain to be the reason for wet grass in the morning, but whether it forms at all is related to the weather overnight.\nThe dew we see and feel on the grass in the morning is linked to how cloudy the sky was the previous night, according to Indiana Public Media (Opens in a new window) . When the sky is clear or mostly clear overnight, the ground cools, and the warm air radiates away from the ground, up toward the sky. If the ground cools enough, dew then forms on the grass. When it's cloudy overnight, the ground retains more of its heat, and not as much heat is radiated up to the sky. Even the heat that radiates off the ground is then reflected back toward the Earth's surface when it hits the cloud layer. This means dew is less likely to form.\nIn essence, dewy grass is most likely in the morning following a warm, sunny day that led into a cooler night dominated by clear skies. The presence of dew on the morning grass \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 has even given rise to a saying about what it means for the day's weather. \"When dew is on the grass, rain will never come to pass. When grass is dry at morning light, look for rain before the night,\" is how the old saying goes.\nThere's some truth to the saying, although it's not a foolproof way to predict the day's weather. Dry grass in the morning usually means either it's cloudy or windy, two indicators that rain may be on the way, the National Parks Service (Opens in a new window) reports. A clear night means dew is more likely on the grass, but it's also an indicator of a pleasant, rain-free day to come.\nIf you are in the habit of watching the weather report on the TV news, you've probably heard meteorologists reference the dew point and what it means for how pleasant the weather will be on a given day. The dew point is the temperature at which dew will form, National Geographic reports. The dew point varies from day to day, based on factors including air temperature, time of day and location.\nThe dew point and humidity are closely related. The dew point is the temperature air needs to be cooled in order to achieve relative humidity of 100%, according to the National Weather Service (Opens in a new window) . At the dew point, the air cannot hold any more water in the form of water vapor, the gaseous form of water. Any increase in moisture in the air will be as water in its liquid form, either as fog or precipitation.\nHumidity alone is not always a good indicator of how comfortable it will be outside, but the dew point is. In general, if the dew point is 55 or lower, the air will feel dry, making it feel comfortable outside, according to the National Weather Service. Dew points between 55 and 65 mean the air will feel a bit humid and muggy, especially in the evenings. Dew points of 65 or greater mean there's a lot of moisture in the air, making it feel very humid. Dew points in the 70s are those oppressively humid days we've come to know all too well in northern Illinois.\nCooper's hawks once faced similar threats to bald eagles and peregrine falcons, but these hawks have recovered and now thrive across Illinois.\nIf you don't take precautions before bringing it indoors, your Christmas tree could be the gift that keeps on giving.\nThe Compass is full of District news and general interest nature stories, while Get Going highlights the must-do programs for the coming week.
