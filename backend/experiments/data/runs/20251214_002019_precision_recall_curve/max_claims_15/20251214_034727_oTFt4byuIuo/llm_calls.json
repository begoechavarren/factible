    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nTrump's egg price warning comes true. Reality hits home. For months, President Donald Trump has falsely claimed that egg prices are tumbling. It wasn't true then, but it's true now. Egg prices fell 12.7% last month, the biggest monthly decline since 1984. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Tuesday, and they could continue to fall this month, too. The USDA reported last week that a dozen large white shell eggs now cost $330 on average, down a whopping 69 from a week before. It's a remarkable reversal after egg prices surged in each of the past 5 months and 17 of the past 19 months because of a deadly aven flu epidemic that necessitated the mass culling of egg laying hens. Maybe the worst of egg gate has passed. Tyler Shipper, associate professor in economics and data analysis at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota, told CNN. Nevertheless, egg prices remain significantly higher now than before the latest bird flu outbreak, and they cost 49.3% more last month than they did a year earlier. Eggs are still more expensive than when Trump took office, according to the BLS. Egg prices this past Easter, which typically rise in the run-up to the holiday, were the highest for any Easter on record, the USDA reported. Well, before last month's decline, Trump had been touting falling egg prices as a sign that his administration's plan to lower prices for consumers has been working. In February, the USDA announced an initiative to lower egg prices, including increased biocurity on egg laying farms, aid to farmers who have lost flocks and temporary lifting of restrictions on egg imports. Despite agriculture secretary Brooke Rollins far more conservative estimate that egg prices would normalize in the summer, Trump last month said, \"As you know, the cost of eggs has come down like 93 94% since we took office. Those percentage declines, Trump stated, are not close to accurate. But we now know that consumer egg prices were indeed falling sharply when Trump made those remarks. The consumer price index data wasn't out yet to confirm or deny Trump's claims. It appears as though Trump may have been talking about wholesale prices, which had been tumbling throughout March before normalizing in recent weeks. Nevertheless, wholesale prices fell by half, not close to the 90% plus figures Trump was citing. Wholesale prices are the costs distributors pay to farmers or middlemen. Consumer prices are what customers pay at grocery stores. Those costs typically make their way through the supply chain at a slower pace because grocery stores may decide to keep prices at a certain price even when wholesale prices change to try to recoup loss profits from prior weeks according to Kevin Bergquist, sector manager at Wells Fargo Agri Food Institute. from prior weeks. According to Kevin Bergquist, sector manager at Wells Fargo Agri Food Institute, the USDA says consumer prices finally fell as demand for eggs decreased and aven flu cases have fallen. Many groceries, including large chains like Costco, had limited customers purchases because of egg shortages. So, Trump's claim that consumer egg prices are down is finally true, even if the timing of his claim and the wild percentages he threw around were grossly inaccurate.

Prices remain 10.9% higher than a year ago.\n\nFull Page Content:\nMENU\nEconomist\nEaster and Passover are both just over a month away, and you may be in for a shock when it comes to egg prices as you prepare for these egg-centric holidays \u2013 whether it be for an Easter egg hunt or a Seder plate. Egg prices are setting new records in 2025. The combination of inflation and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has caused egg prices to rise more than 350% per dozen compared to this time last year. In fact, some restaurants are having to raise menu prices just to keep up with the cost of eggs. But what is responsible for this rise in price? This Market Intel will evaluate the two biggest causes of record high-egg prices and how these prices are ultimately driven by big challenges in farm country.\nEgg Prices and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza\nEggs are considered an inelastic good. This means that even when egg prices change, consumers still buy about the same amount of eggs. Unlike other products, in many applications such as baking, eggs don\u2019t have good substitutes. They are also a healthy \u2013 and typically the most affordable \u2013 source of protein, which makes them desirable even if prices go up. This relatively unchanging demand for eggs means that supply factors can have a big impact on egg prices.\nThe loss of egg-laying chickens from HPAI is the biggest factor driving up egg prices. Since 2022, HPAI has affected over 166 million birds including 127 million egg layers. That\u2019s an average loss of 42.3 million egg layers per year, or about 11% of the 5-year average annual layer inventory of 383 million hens since the outbreak began. These losses have resulted in reduced egg supplies and record egg prices. According to USDA\u2019s Economic Research Service (ERS), the monthly national average price for large Grade A eggs in January was a record-high $4.95 per dozen. Some 12 million birds, mostly layers, were lost in February, bringing the total number of birds affected so far in 2025 to over 35 million and driving egg prices even higher. The daily national average price for a dozen large eggs was $8.15 per dozen on March 4, 2025.\nThis outbreak has been different than the 2014-2015 outbreak. In 2015, the virus came on strong and basically disappeared after a year affecting over 50 million birds. In past outbreaks of Avian Influenza, we\u2019ve seen hot weather kill off the virus. Instead of disappearing when the seasons change, the virus has continued to circulate in wild birds as well as our nation\u2019s poultry flock. Another difference between the current outbreak and the one that occurred in 2015 is there are a lot more backyard flocks in the U.S. compared to 2015. This means more birds that are vulnerable to getting the virus, and more opportunities for the virus to spread along the flyways where migratory birds travel.\nRemarkable Resilience\nAccording to USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service\u2019s (NASS) annual Chickens and Eggs Summary, the average inventory of U.S. egg-laying hens was 375 million, down 14 million, or 3.5% from 389 million hens prior to the 2022 outbreak of HPAI. In 2024, table egg production was about 93.1 billion eggs, down 2.5 billion eggs or 2.6% from 2021. The industry at all levels has shown remarkable resilience in keeping eggs on grocery store shelves and providing an essential protein source to American consumers. Since 2022, egg farmers have lost on average 11% of the laying flock every year due to HPAI, yet they astonishingly managed to keep the annual average layer flock size just 3.5% below pre-outbreak levels.\nEgg Prices and the Farmer\nHigher prices for eggs do not mean farmers are getting rich. On the contrary, these prices are a result of the farmer\u2019s loss of millions of birds to disease. USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) does have an indemnity program that provides compensation to the grower or owner for infected or exposed poultry and eggs that are destroyed to control HPAI. However, it can take up to a year for a farm to complete cleaning and raise new chicks to egg-laying age. This indemnity does not cover costs during the time the farm goes without income. On top of the economic loss, the death of an entire flock, sometimes millions of birds, from avian influenza is a traumatic experience for farm families.\nThe United States\u2019 primary control and eradication strategy for HPAI in domestic poultry, as defined by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), is de-population. When HPAI is detected, the entire flock is de-populated, for several reasons. When HPAI is present in even one bird in a poultry house or barn, it typically spreads through the whole facility. Another reason is to prevent spillover into other houses on the premises or wild birds that could spread the virus which also leads to a greater risk for mutation. Research has shown that de-population is the most humane and effective method of control. HPAI affects multiple organs in birds with a mortality rate near 100%. This is a higher mortality rate than the Ebola virus in humans.\nInflation and Cost of Production\nInflation is another, if less dramatic, factor driving up egg prices. While inflation has slowed over the last couple of years, it\u2019s important to remember inflation is a measure of growth. Slowing inflation doesn\u2019t mean prices are going down, it means they are getting expensive more slowly. According to Bureau of Labor and Statistics (BLS), the unadjusted Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all items for urban consumers rose 0.5% in January bringing CPI inflation for the year to 3%. The unadjusted 12-month CPI for eggs contributed to this, rising 53% from Jan. 2024 to Jan. 2025. Shorter term, the CPI for eggs was up 13.8% in just two months, from Dec. 2024 to Jan. 2025.\nInflation does more than drive up the price of eggs in the grocery store, it also raises the cost of everything it takes to produce eggs on the farm and get them on grocery store shelves. According to USDA\u2019s latest farm income forecast estimates, total farm production ex\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",
