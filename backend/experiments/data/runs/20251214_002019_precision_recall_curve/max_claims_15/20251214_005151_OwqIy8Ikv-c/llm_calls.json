    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nI\u2019m an atmospheric physicist. I\u2019ve published more than 200 scientific papers. For 30 years I taught at MIT, during which time the climate has changed remarkably little. But the cry of \u201cglobal warming\u201d has grown ever more shrill. In fact, it seems that the less the climate changes, the louder the voices of the climate alarmists get. So, let\u2019s clear the air and create a more accurate picture of where we really stand on the issue of global warming or, as it is now called -- climate change. There are basically three groups of people dealing with this issue. Groups one and two are scientists. Group three consists mostly, at its core, of politicians, environmentalists and media. Group one is associated with the scientific part of the United Nation\u2019s International Panel on Climate Change or IPCC (Working Group 1). These are scientists who mostly believe that recent climate change is primarily due to man\u2019s burning of fossil fuels -- oil, coal and natural gas. This releases C02, carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere and, they believe, this might eventually dangerously heat the planet. Group two is made up of scientists who don\u2019t see this as an especially serious problem. This is the group I belong to. We\u2019re usually referred to as skeptics. We note that there are many reasons why the climate changes -- the sun, clouds, oceans, the orbital variations of the earth, as well as a myriad of other inputs. None of these is fully understood, and there is no evidence that CO2 emissions are the dominant factor. But actually there is much agreement between both groups of scientists. The following are such points of agreement: 1) The climate is always changing. 2) CO2 is a greenhouse gas without which life on earth is not possible, but adding it to the atmosphere should lead to some warming. 3) Atmospheric levels of CO2 have been increasing since the end of the Little Ice Age in the 19th century. 4) Over this period (the past two centuries), the global mean temperature has increased slightly and erratically by about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit or one degree Celsius; but only since the 1960\u2019s have man\u2019s greenhouse emissions been sufficient to play a role. 5) Given the complexity of climate, no confident prediction about future global mean temperature or its impact can be made. The IPCC, acknowledged in its own 2007 report that \u201cThe long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible.\u201d Most importantly, the scenario that the burning of fossil fuels leads to catastrophe isn\u2019t part of what either group asserts. So why are so many people worried, indeed, panic stricken about this issue. Here\u2019s where Group Three comes in -- the politicians, environmentalists, and media. Global Warming Alarmism provides them, more than any other issue, with the things they most want: For politicians it\u2019s money and power. For environmentalists it\u2019s money for their organizations and confirmation of their near religious devotion to the idea that man is a destructive force acting upon nature. And for the media it\u2019s ideology, money, and headlines -- doomsday scenarios sell. Meanwhile, over the last decade, scientists outside of climate physics have jumped on the bandwagon, publishing papers blaming global warming for everything from acne to the Syrian civil war. And, crony capitalists have eagerly grabbed for the subsidies that governments have so lavishly provided. Unfortunately, group three is winning the argument because they have drowned out the serious debate that should be going on. But while politicians, environmentalists and media types can waste a lot of money and scare a lot of people, they won\u2019t be able to bury the truth. The climate will have the final word on that.

Greenhouse gases trap the heat from sunlight, warming the planet. Without any greenhouse gases, Earth would be too cold to support life. But the more greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere, the warmer the planet becomes.\nCarbon dioxide comes from sources such as the burning of fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, and natural gas), wildfires, and volcanic eruptions. The graph shows atmospheric CO2 levels measured by NOAA at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, since 1958.

The data shown are the latest available, updated monthly.\nThe second animated graph shows CO2 levels from an Antarctic ice core in combination with the observations from Mauna Loa Observatory. This extends the record back through Earth\u2019s last three glacial cycles. The Antarctic ice core measures CO2 levels trapped in tiny air bubbles from the past that were preserved when the ice formed.\nGround-based and satellite measurements have measured a sharp increase in atmospheric CO2 in recent decades. With a more than 50% increase in CO2 since the start of industrial times in the 18th century, scientific measurements have linked this increase primarily to the burning of coal, oil, and gas. This means that CO2 levels are now 150% the value they were at in 1750 \u2014 this is at least 1.5 times greater than the natural increase observed at the end of the last ice age 20,000 years ago, which happened over thousands of years.\nThe animated map below shows the historical changes in global carbon dioxide over time. Note the colors change as the amount of CO2 rises from 365 parts per million (ppm) in 2002 to over 420 ppm in 2022. These measurements from the AIRS instrument come from the mid-troposphere, the layer of Earth's atmosphere that is 8 to 12 kilometers (about 5 to 7 miles) above the ground.\nA closer look at the carbon dioxide measurements at Mauna Loa shows a series of wiggles in the data. Although total CO2 is increasing each year, there is also a short-term cycle visible within the larger trend.\nThis annual rise and fall of CO2 levels is caused by seasonal cycles in photosynthesis on a global scale. In Northern Hemisphere spring, plants come to life and draw in CO2 to fuel their growth. This begins the process of lowering the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. In northern autumn, plant growth stops or slows down, and the whole process reverses itself. Much of the plant matter decomposes, releasing CO2 back to the atmosphere.\nA similar but less intense pattern repeats in the Southern Hemisphere in opposite seasons. Spring growth starts in September and winter decomposition begins in March, so CO2 records in the Southern Hemisphere show the opposite pattern of that seen in Mauna Loa. However, because there is a lot more land and vegetation in the Northern Hemisphere than the southern, the global yearly cycle more closely aligns with the northern seasons.\nSee the cycle in action in the visualization Watching Earth Breathe: The Seasonal Vegetation Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide.\nThis cycle of plant growth gives the graph of CO2 a sawtooth pattern of ups and downs from year to year. At a larger scale, the upward climb of the trend line over the decades is caused by CO2 emissions, primarily from burning fossil fuels.

Under his Climate Change Action Plan, London will get 25 percent of its power from more-efficient, local sources and reduce carbon emissions 60 percent within 20 years; in addition, he\u2019s pledged about $90 million in the 2008 budget for programs to fight climate change. And that\u2019s just the wonky stuff \u2014 Livingstone has also announced plans for a housing development in East London that will produce no carbon emissions.\nHelen Clark Clark, the prime minister of New Zealand, has pledged to make Kiwiland the first carbon-neutral country by reducing emissions and offsetting the rest.

Today, she is Brazil\u2019s environment minister and an avid protector of the Amazon. Due in part to her efforts, deforestation of the Brazilian rainforest has decreased by nearly 50 percent in the past two years.\nDavid Cameron British Conservative Party leader Cameron is challenging the green cred of the more-traditionally environmental Labor Party with his ambitious policy recommendations, which include binding annual targets for cutting carbon emissions, energy decentralization, and \u201cfrequent flyer\u201d taxes aimed at restricting aviation.

His previous gigs will also strike a chord with greens: he spent 10 years as president of the Australian Conservation Foundation and two years on the international board of Greenpeace, and was a founding member of the Surfrider Foundation, an ocean-advocacy group.\nGreg Nickels As mayor of Seattle, Nickels initiated the U.S. Mayors Climate Protection Agreement, a group of 496 municipal leaders (so far) who have pledged their cities to meet the Kyoto Protocol target of a 7 percent reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions from 1990 levels by 2012. Participating mayors, who together represent more than 64 million Americans, also urge climate action on the national level. Nickels\u2019 local goals include increasing the number of trees in the Emerald City and improving bike and public-transportation options.\nMargot Wallstr\u00f6m As environment minister of the European Union from 1999 to 2004, Wallstr\u00f6m aggressively sought to boost standards for chemical safety, improve air and water quality, and create detailed action plans on climate change, biodiversity, and resource preservation. She was a leader in convincing every last E.U. member to ratify the Kyoto Protocol in 2002, and an outspoken critic of the U.S.\u2019s failure to ratify.

Since carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, this increase has warmed the planet.\n430ppm\nJune 2025\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) is an important greenhouse gas. Greenhouse gases trap the heat from sunlight, warming the planet. Without any greenhouse gases, Earth would be too cold to support life. But the more greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere, the warmer the planet becomes.\nCarbon dioxide comes from sources such as the burning of fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, and natural gas), wildfires, and volcanic eruptions. The graph shows atmospheric CO2 levels measured by NOAA at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, since 1958. It's important to note that \u201cparts per million\u201d refers to the number of carbon dioxide molecules per million molecules of dry air. The data shown are the latest available, updated monthly.\nThe second animated graph shows CO2 levels from an Antarctic ice core in combination with the observations from Mauna Loa Observatory. This extends the record back through Earth\u2019s last three glacial cycles. The Antarctic ice core measures CO2 levels trapped in tiny air bubbles from the past that were preserved when the ice formed.\nGround-based and satellite measurements have measured a sharp increase in atmospheric CO2 in recent decades. With a more than 50% increase in CO2 since the start of industrial times in the 18th century, scientific measurements have linked this increase primarily to the burning of coal, oil, and gas. This means that CO2 levels are now 150% the value they were at in 1750 \u2014 this is at least 1.5 times greater than the natural increase observed at the end of the last ice age 20,000 years ago, which happened over thousands of years.\nThe animated map below shows the historical changes in global carbon dioxide over time.

Time to hone the rhetorical skills!\nWacki says\n12 MAR 2007 AT 7:44 PM\nOne of the postdocs I work next to recently told me \u201cMichael Moore has it right. If you can\u2019t make it entertaining you will never reach the general population\u201d. When it comes to disseminating the truth you need to set up a solid backbone for credibility and then grab their attention with entertainment. RC is a critical part of the backbone but it can not get everything done by itself. Al Gore has made this abundantly clear with his \u2018documentary\u2019. Just be careful and don\u2019t let yourself become a target. RC is too important for you to be taking unnecessary risks.\nThe house is sold out. Have fun with this Gavin. I have no doubt you will slaughter them. BTW, since you are going to meet Crichton in person would you mind asking him if he still believes in spoon bending, auras, etc? His book Travels is quite a trip.\nTodd Albert says\n12 MAR 2007 AT 7:46 PM\nI think the value will depend greatly on the moderator. If the format and questions are fair, then truth will prevail. At least in theory.\nBest of luck! We\u2019ll be watching.\nGary McClellan says\n12 MAR 2007 AT 7:46 PM\nIt is worthwhile, because it accomplishes nothing positive to let them say their spiel unchallenged. The people who deny the reality of what is happening are still going to be out there, running their mouths. An appearance by someone who has undeniable credentials to discuss the issue will only help challenge the logjam that the denialists have in some people\u2019s heads.\nWacki says\n12 MAR 2007 AT 7:51 PM\n\u201cIf the format allows enough time to really delve into a handful of topics and allows you to combat misrepresentation it could be worthwhile.\u201d\nIf the debate is going to be broadcasted I would make sure they tell the listeners that you (and your friends) will be doing a post-game analysis at RC. Time is your Achilles heel and if time is short Crichton will have the advantage. Making quick catchy soundbites is where Crichton excels and the vast majority of scientists fail miserably. Make sure you leave yourself an out.\nSteven Leibo Ph.D. says\n12 MAR 2007 AT 7:52 PM\nI have often been in that situation.. really two ways to approach the challenge aside from knowing the science of global warming down cold, one needs to know incredibly well the anti-global warming challenges and lots of quick soundbites to refute them. Second some really solid texts from major university presses that can be held up.. they make great props. Aside from that just keep reminding those on the other side of the debate that you would absolutely love for them to be right. That nothing would make you happier than to be proven wrong but unfortunately there is simply too much scientific consensus to do anything other that to face the challenge. Good luck!\nGareth says\n12 MAR 2007 AT 8:00 PM\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Gavin, I wouldn\u2019t touch this sort of event with a bargepole.

Time to hone the rhetorical skills!\nWacki says\n12 MAR 2007 AT 7:44 PM\nOne of the postdocs I work next to recently told me \u201cMichael Moore has it right. If you can\u2019t make it entertaining you will never reach the general population\u201d. When it comes to disseminating the truth you need to set up a solid backbone for credibility and then grab their attention with entertainment. RC is a critical part of the backbone but it can not get everything done by itself. Al Gore has made this abundantly clear with his \u2018documentary\u2019. Just be careful and don\u2019t let yourself become a target. RC is too important for you to be taking unnecessary risks.\nThe house is sold out. Have fun with this Gavin. I have no doubt you will slaughter them. BTW, since you are going to meet Crichton in person would you mind asking him if he still believes in spoon bending, auras, etc? His book Travels is quite a trip.\nTodd Albert says\n12 MAR 2007 AT 7:46 PM\nI think the value will depend greatly on the moderator. If the format and questions are fair, then truth will prevail. At least in theory.\nBest of luck! We\u2019ll be watching.\nGary McClellan says\n12 MAR 2007 AT 7:46 PM\nIt is worthwhile, because it accomplishes nothing positive to let them say their spiel unchallenged. The people who deny the reality of what is happening are still going to be out there, running their mouths. An appearance by someone who has undeniable credentials to discuss the issue will only help challenge the logjam that the denialists have in some people\u2019s heads.\nWacki says\n12 MAR 2007 AT 7:51 PM\n\u201cIf the format allows enough time to really delve into a handful of topics and allows you to combat misrepresentation it could be worthwhile.\u201d\nIf the debate is going to be broadcasted I would make sure they tell the listeners that you (and your friends) will be doing a post-game analysis at RC. Time is your Achilles heel and if time is short Crichton will have the advantage. Making quick catchy soundbites is where Crichton excels and the vast majority of scientists fail miserably. Make sure you leave yourself an out.\nSteven Leibo Ph.D. says\n12 MAR 2007 AT 7:52 PM\nI have often been in that situation.. really two ways to approach the challenge aside from knowing the science of global warming down cold, one needs to know incredibly well the anti-global warming challenges and lots of quick soundbites to refute them. Second some really solid texts from major university presses that can be held up.. they make great props. Aside from that just keep reminding those on the other side of the debate that you would absolutely love for them to be right. That nothing would make you happier than to be proven wrong but unfortunately there is simply too much scientific consensus to do anything other that to face the challenge. Good luck!\nGareth says\n12 MAR 2007 AT 8:00 PM\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Gavin, I wouldn\u2019t touch this sort of event with a bargepole.

These scientists were interested chiefly in the possibility that a lower level of carbon dioxide gas might explain the ice ages of the distant past. At the turn of the century, Svante Arrhenius calculated that emissions from human industry might someday bring a global warming. Other scientists dismissed his idea as faulty. In 1938, G.S. Callendar argued that the level of carbon dioxide was climbing and raising global temperature, but most scientists found his arguments implausible. It was almost by chance that a few researchers in the 1950s discovered that global warming truly was possible. In the early 1960s, C.D. Keeling measured the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere: it was rising fast. Researchers began to take an interest, struggling to understand how the level of carbon dioxide had changed in the past, and how the level was influenced by chemical and biological forces. By 2000, computer calculations along with evidence from ancient climates showed unequivocally that human emissions of the gas were raising Earth's temperature. Attention turned to studying how the gas was emitted or taken up by natural systems as well as by humanity, how far the temperature would rise, and what could be done to avoid disaster by curbing emissions.

According to ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nKey Takeaway: The amount of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere has increased sharply in the past 100 years as measured from the ground and from satellites. Since carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, this increase has warmed the planet.\n430ppm\nJune 2025\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) is an important greenhouse gas. Greenhouse gases trap the heat from sunlight, warming the planet. Without any greenhouse gases, Earth would be too cold to support life. But the more greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere, the warmer the planet becomes.\nCarbon dioxide comes from sources such as the burning of fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, and natural gas), wildfires, and volcanic eruptions. The graph shows atmospheric CO2 levels measured by NOAA at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, since 1958. It's important to note that \u201cparts per million\u201d refers to the number of carbon dioxide molecules per million molecules of dry air. The data shown are the latest available, updated monthly.\nThe second animated graph shows CO2 levels from an Antarctic ice core in combination with the observations from Mauna Loa Observatory. This extends the record back through Earth\u2019s last three glacial cycles. The Antarctic ice core measures CO2 levels trapped in tiny air bubbles from the past that were preserved when the ice formed.\nGround-based and satellite measurements have measured a sharp increase in atmospheric CO2 in recent decades. With a more than 50% increase in CO2 since the start of industrial times in the 18th century, scientific measurements have linked this increase primarily to the burning of coal, oil, and gas. This means that CO2 levels are now 150% the value they were at in 1750 \u2014 this is at least 1.5 times greater than the natural increase observed at the end of the last ice age 20,000 years ago, which happened over thousands of years.\nThe animated map below shows the historical changes in global carbon dioxide over time. Note the colors change as the amount of CO2 rises from 365 parts per million (ppm) in 2002 to over 420 ppm in 2022. These measurements from the AIRS instrument come from the mid-troposphere, the layer of Earth's atmosphere that is 8 to 12 kilometers (about 5 to 7 miles) above the ground.\nA closer look at the carbon dioxide measurements at Mauna Loa shows a series of wiggles in the data. Although total CO2 is increasing each year, there is also a short-term cycle visible within the larger trend.\nThis annual rise and fall of CO2 levels is caused by seasonal cycles in photosynthesis on a global scale. In Northern Hemisphere spring, plants come to life and draw in CO2 to fuel their growth. This begins the process of lowering the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. In northern autumn, plant growth stops or slows down, and the whole process reverses itself. Much of the plant matter decomposes, releasing CO2 back to the atmosphere.\nA similar but less intense pattern repeats in the Southern Hemisphere in opposite seasons. Spring growth starts in September and winter decomposition begins in March, so CO2 records in the Southern Hemisphere show the opposite pattern of that seen in Mauna Loa. However, because there is a lot more land and vegetation in the Northern Hemisphere than the southern, the global yearly cycle more closely aligns with the northern seasons.\nSee the cycle in action in the visualization Watching Earth Breathe: The Seasonal Vegetation Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide.\nThis cycle of plant growth gives the graph of CO2 a sawtooth pattern of ups and downs from year to year. At a larger scale, the upward climb of the trend line over the decades is caused by CO2 emissions, primarily from burning fossil fuels. Thus, the data illustrate both natural factors and human additions of CO2.\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Right or wrong, why do so many people think he should be silenced?\nNew perk: Easily find new routes and hidden gems, upcoming running events, and more near you. Your weekly Local Running Newsletter has everything you need to lace up! Subscribe today.\nWITH HIS BEARD and tweedy jacket, Richard Lindzen looks like a cheerful physics professor from the fifties, inspiring nostalgia for the age of space exploration and other grand, forward-looking American endeavors. On a cold March evening in New London, Connecticut, the 67-year-old atmospheric scientist from MIT is trying to serve up a little optimism about the gloomiest topic of our time: global warming.\nOptimism? Yeah, as in: Don\u2019t worry about a thing. Just now, Lindzen is scoffing at the widely accepted view that CO2 buildup is to blame for the heat waves, prolonged droughts, and intense hurricanes that the U.S. and other countries have experienced in recent years. At a time when much of the nation\u2019s political, intellectual, and business leadership accepts the idea that people are the cause of global warming, Lindzen loudly disagrees.\n\u201cAll scientific issues\u2014and this is no different\u2014are difficult to understand,\u201d he tells a group of cadets and locals assembled in an auditorium at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy. \u201cExtreme weather events are always present. There\u2019s no evidence it\u2019s getting better, or worse, or changing.\u201d\nLindzen\u2019s relaxed delivery gives the audience a comfortable sense that they, like him, are smart enough to question the pronouncements of nervous scientists and high-octane advocates like Al Gore. Skepticism is a good idea, he says, since so many people who sound off about global warming don\u2019t bother to read the documents that supposedly forecast climate apocalypse. \u201cThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, if you read it\u2014and no one does \u2026\u201d he says, and that phrase alone prompts laughter.\nThis ability to put people at ease helps explain why, after nearly two decades of effort, Lindzen has achieved exalted status among the current crop of global-warming doubters. He has personally briefed President Bush\u2019s top science adviser on climate change and is very popular with senior GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill. He publishes opinion pieces in The Wall Street Journal and speaks publicly several times a month, both in the U.S. and abroad. With so many Americans searching for answers on climate change, an endowed MIT professor with pithy quotes offers a level of assurance that few can rival.\nIn doing so, however, Lindzen is challenging the scientific establishment, which tends to sing in scary harmony about this issue. The UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is an international scientific body, 2,500 researchers strong, that weighs in on the planet\u2019s climate health every five years or so. Earlier this year, the IPCC rolled out a series of three massive documents asserting that global warming is an established fact and outlining where it all will lead.\nThe reports maintain that there\u2019s more than a 90 percent chance that human activity\u2014primarily the burning of fossil fuels, resulting in increased levels of atmospheric CO2\u2014is responsible for the earth\u2019s recent warming, which amounts to a 1.2-degree-Fahrenheit rise in global mean temperature over the past 100 years. Noting that the current atmospheric concentration of CO2 is higher than it\u2019s been in the past 650,000 years, the IPCC predicts that human-induced climate change could spell extinction for 20 to 30 percent of the world\u2019s species by the end of this century, cause increasingly destructive weather patterns, and flood coastal cities.\nLindzen doesn\u2019t dispute that the planet has warmed up in the past three decades, but he argues that human-generated CO2 accounts for no more than 30 percent of this temperature rise. Much of the warming, he says, stems from fluctuations in temperature that have occurred for millions of years\u2014explained by complicated natural changes in equilibrium between the oceans and the atmosphere\u2014and the latest period of warming will not result in catastrophe.\nWhether such arguments are true, false, or nuts, they seem to make an impression on the Coast Guard crowd. Edward Hug, a Massachusetts retiree who came to hear Lindzen speak, is exactly the kind of person the professor wants to sway. Hug, who used to work in underwater acoustics for the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, says he\u2019s been diligently trying to educate himself about global warming.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen Al Gore\u2019s film twice, but I\u2019ve also read Michael Crichton\u2019s State of Fear, which makes a compelling case on the other side,\u201d says Hug, referring to the controversial 2004 novel in which Crichton\u2014using scientific arguments that were hotly challenged by critics\u2014ridiculed the global-warming consensus as the work of conspiratorial alarmists.\nHug sees the IPCC as \u201cthe closest thing to a gold standard when it comes to science,\u201d but he still wants to know whether Americans have to change their lifestyles radically in order to save the planet. \u201cThe question is,\u201d he said earlier as he settled in to hear Lindzen, \u201cis it worth making the sacrifice?\u201d\nBy evening\u2019s end, he decides to join th\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

He was vice president of the United States from 1993 to 2001.\n\nFull Page Content:\nAl Gore is an American politician and environmentalist. He was vice president of the United States from 1993 to 2001, the Democratic Party's presidential nominee in 2000, and the co-recipient of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\nHe has been involved with the environmental activist movement for a number of decades and has had full participation since he left the vice-presidency in 2001. His most famous effort since then was the documentary An Inconvenient Truth from 2006, where he warns for the consequences of human-induced climate change for mankind.\nGore stated in an interview for The New York Times that his interest in environmentalism began when he was a teenager:\nAs I was entering high school, my mother was reading Silent Spring and the dinner table conversation was about pesticides and the environment ... The year I graduated from college the momentum was building for Earth Day. After that, as I was entering divinity school, the Club of Rome report came out and the limits to growth was a main issue.[1]\nGore has been involved with environmental work for a number of decades. In 1976, at 28, after joining the United States House of Representatives, Gore held the \"first congressional hearings on the climate change, and co-sponsor[ed] hearings on toxic waste and global warming\".[2][3] He continued to speak on the topic throughout the 1980s[4] and was known as one of the Atari Democrats, later called the \"Democrats' Greens, politicians who see issues like clean air, clean water and global warming as the key to future victories for their party\".[1][5]\nIn 1989, while still a Senator, Gore published an editorial in The Washington Post, in which he argued:\nHumankind has suddenly entered into a brand new relationship with the planet Earth. The world's forests are being destroyed; an enormous hole is opening in the ozone layer. Living species are dying at an unprecedented rate.[6]\nIn 1990, Senator Gore presided over a three-day conference with legislators from over 42 countries which sought to create a Global Marshall Plan, \"under which industrial nations would help less developed countries grow economically while still protecting the environment\".[7]\nThe Concord Monitor says that Gore \"was one of the first politicians to grasp the seriousness of climate change and to call for a reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases\".[8]\nAs Vice President, Gore was involved in a number of initiatives related to the environment. He launched the GLOBE program on Earth Day 1994, an education and science activity that, according to Forbes, \"made extensive use of the Internet to increase student awareness of their environment\".[9] In the late 1990s, Gore strongly pushed for the passage of the Kyoto Protocol, which called for reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.[10][11] He was opposed by the Senate, which passed unanimously (95\u20130) the Byrd\u2013Hagel Resolution (S. Res. 98),[12] which stated the sense of the Senate was that the United States should not be a signatory to any protocol that did not include binding targets and timetables for developing as well as industrialized nations or \"would result in serious harm to the economy of the United States\".[13] On November 12, 1998, Gore symbolically signed the protocol. Both Gore and Senator Joseph Lieberman indicated that the protocol would not be acted upon in the Senate until there was participation by the developing nations.[14] The Clinton Administration never submitted the protocol to the Senate for ratification. In 1998, Gore became associated with Digital Earth.[15] He also began promoting a NASA satellite that would provide a constant view of Earth, marking the first time such an image would have been made since The Blue Marble photo from the 1972 Apollo 17 mission. The \"Triana\" satellite would have been permanently mounted in the L1 Lagrangian Point, 1.5 million km away.[16] This satellite would allow the measurement of the earth's changing reflectivity (albedo) due to melting ice caps, but the project was put on hold by George W. Bush's administration. The satellite was finally launched in 2015 as the Deep Space Climate Observatory.\nIn 2004, Gore co-launched Generation Investment Management, a company for which he serves as Chair. The company was \"a new London fund management firm that plans to create environment-friendly portfolios. Generation Investment will manage assets of institutional investors, such as pension funds, foundations and endowments, as well as those of 'high net worth individuals,' from offices in London and Washington, D.C.\"[17] The fund's filed accounts showed profits in 2017 of \u00a3248.5m, with assets of \u00a314.2bn. Turnover at the London-based operation was \u00a3293m with distributed profits of \u00a3193m to the firm's 32 members, one of the senior staff receiving \u00a341m (The Sunday Times (UK), September 16, 2018).\nGore and The Alliance for Climate Protection created the We Can Solve It organization, a web-based program with multiple advertisements on television focused on spreading awareness for climate crisis (global warming) and petitioning for the press putting more attention on the crisis, the government doing more to help the environment, and their ultimate goal is the end to global warming. Although focused mostly upon the United States, and Americans, it is an international petition and effort. It already has over one million signatures.[18]\nIn recent years, Gore has remained busy traveling the world speaking and participating in events mainly aimed towards global warming awareness and prevention.[19] His keynote presentation on global warming has received standing ovations, and he has presented it at least 1,000 times according to his monologue in An Inconvenient Truth. His speaking fee is $100,000.[20] Gore's global warming presentations in several major cities have sometimes been associated with exceptionally severe cold weather, a juxtaposition since dubbed \"the Gore Effec\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

They would speak regularly at ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nSingularly focused, they are credited with laying the groundwork for the shift among Senate Democrats from being climate cautious to climate advocates.\nWhen the largest climate bill in U.S. history passed the Senate this month, Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) choked back tears.\n\u201cThis is a planetary emergency, and this is the first time the federal government has taken action that is worthy of the moment,\u201d he told reporters at the time. \u201cNow I can look my kids in the eye and say we\u2019re really doing something about climate.\u201d\nFor Schatz, one of Congress\u2019s most vocal climate hawks, the moment marked the triumphant culmination of a long, treacherous effort to muscle climate legislation through the upper chamber.\n\u201cIt was relief,\u201d Schatz said in an interview. \u201cIt was a celebration of the work that everybody had done, but most importantly to me is it represented hope that the United States government can address the biggest single challenge of this political generation.\u201d\nIt was \u201ca political miracle,\u201d Schatz added.\nSchatz, 49, embodies a new type of climate hawk on Capitol Hill \u2014 one that resonates with a younger generation of climate activists determined to win buy-in not just from environmentalists but also from farmers, ranchers, Native people, labor groups, low-income communities and corporations, too. Schatz, who chairs the Indian Affairs Committee, understood that the people who are affected must be brought into the effort.\nHe doesn\u2019t do it alone. He and two of his colleagues, Sens. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), who is 50, and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), who is 66, teamed up over the past decade to craft a new model of persistent activism inside the power corridors of Congress alongside a growing climate-focused advocacy.\nAnd they still work alongside other Democrats who have long prioritized climate, including Sen. Edward J. Markey (Mass.), 76, who spearheaded the failed 2010 cap-and-trade effort and the Green New Deal, and Sen. Thomas R. Carper (Del.), 75, who chairs the Environment and Public Works Committee, and played a role in crafting the Democrats\u2019 $370 billion climate bill.\nSchatz has not attracted as much attention for his climate advocacy as Whitehouse, who has delivered nearly 300 \u201cTime to Wake Up\u201d speeches on the Senate floor to urge legislative action on global warming. But Schatz came to the Senate with climate credentials: He asked Neil Abercrombie, Hawaii\u2019s governor at the time, to appoint him to serve the rest of longtime Democratic Sen. Daniel Inouye\u2019s term after Inouye\u2019s death in 2012 because climate was Schatz\u2019s top priority.\nSchatz\u2019s arrival gave Whitehouse, elected to the Senate in 2006 and its most vocal climate activist, a more soft-spoken partner. They began to strategize and plan to raise awareness and lay the foundation for legislation. They organized an overnight talk-a-thon on the Senate floor about climate in 2014 and introduced a bill to tax carbon emissions. Notably, moderate and vulnerable Democrats didn\u2019t participate and the carbon tax bill didn\u2019t go anywhere.\n\u201cThis was like before everybody was worried about climate or before climate action was cool,\u201d said Tiernen Sittenfeld, senior vice president of government affairs at the League of Conservation Voters. Sittenfeld began working with Schatz on climate days after he arrived in D.C. \u201cThis used to be a much lonelier fight in Congress.\u201d\nHeinrich, a close friend of Schatz\u2019s who built a solar car in college and drove it across the country, made the duo a trio when he joined the Senate in 2013.\nThe three men come from different parts of the country that are facing different, but equally dangerous, climate disasters.\nIn Hawaii, sea levels have risen about 10 inches since 1950, increasing the frequency of flooding for coastal communities. In New Mexico, a stretch of the Rio Grande recently ran dry for the first time in 40 years amid a historic megadrought. And in Rhode Island, rising ocean temperatures are straining the state\u2019s lobster industry.\nThey have made climate change a primary focus of their Senate careers.\n\u201c \u2018The Three Climateers\u2019 [is what] we have called ourselves at various times to try and cheer ourselves up,\u201d Whitehouse said in an interview.\nIn November, they all flew to the COP26 U.N. climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland. Some attendees called them the \u201cthree amigos\u201d because they appeared inseparable and they had the same message: The United States will be a leader on climate.\nThe three have been meeting every week since 2019 to plan legislative and social media campaigns around climate. They would speak regularly at weekly closed-door Democratic lunches to keep climate top of mind for their caucus.\nClimate change was not always a winning issue for Democrats, and even now, Democratic strategists admit that it won\u2019t play well in every district or state in November\u2019s midterm elections, especially in areas where the economy is reliant on fossil fuels.\nThe lowest point for climate advocates was in 2010, when moderate Senate Democrats facing head winds in their reelection efforts urged President Barack Obama to walk away from a major cap-and-trade bill after a bruising fight to pass the Affordable Care Act. (He did.) Little has happened legislatively on climate since then. Until now.\nSlowly, the trio saw a shift in their colleagues.\nSchatz said the climate movement \u2014 and the lawmakers\u2019 persistence \u2014 transformed \u201can issue that used to divide Democrats into an issue that motivates and unites Democrats.\u201d\n\u201cWe reached the point in this Congress where it was a major issue for the vast majority of the caucus,\u201d Heinrich said. \u201cI think leadership and [Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.)], in particular, responded to that. I mean, he saw the activism that was occurring in his home state and then also the way the entire caucus was making that a priority.\u201d\nWhitehouse said the Trump administration, which dramatically cut environmental regulations and withdrew from the Paris agreement with the backing of R\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

These scientists were interested chiefly in the possibility that a lower level of carbon dioxide gas might explain the ice ages of the distant past. At the turn of the century, Svante Arrhenius calculated that emissions from human industry might someday bring a global warming. Other scientists dismissed his idea as faulty. In 1938, G.S. Callendar argued that the level of carbon dioxide was climbing and raising global temperature, but most scientists found his arguments implausible. It was almost by chance that a few researchers in the 1950s discovered that global warming truly was possible. In the early 1960s, C.D. Keeling measured the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere: it was rising fast. Researchers began to take an interest, struggling to understand how the level of carbon dioxide had changed in the past, and how the level was influenced by chemical and biological forces. By 2000, computer calculations along with evidence from ancient climates showed unequivocally that human emissions of the gas were raising Earth's temperature. Attention turned to studying how the gas was emitted or taken up by natural systems as well as by humanity, how far the temperature would rise, and what could be done to avoid disaster by curbing emissions.

These scientists were interested chiefly in the possibility that a lower level of carbon dioxide gas might explain the ice ages of the distant past. At the turn of the century, Svante Arrhenius calculated that emissions from human industry might someday bring a global warming. Other scientists dismissed his idea as faulty. In 1938, G.S. Callendar argued that the level of carbon dioxide was climbing and raising global temperature, but most scientists found his arguments implausible. It was almost by chance that a few researchers in the 1950s discovered that global warming truly was possible. In the early 1960s, C.D. Keeling measured the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere: it was rising fast. Researchers began to take an interest, struggling to understand how the level of carbon dioxide had changed in the past, and how the level was influenced by chemical and biological forces. By 2000, computer calculations along with evidence from ancient climates showed unequivocally that human emissions of the gas were raising Earth's temperature. Attention turned to studying how the gas was emitted or taken up by natural systems as well as by humanity, how far the temperature would rise, and what could be done to avoid disaster by curbing emissions.

IPCC ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nParticipate in the 2025 international science photo competition!\nThe IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) is a report on climate change created with the help of a large number of contributors, both scientists and governmental representatives. There has been considerable political controversy over a small number of errors found in the report, and there have been calls for review of the process used to formulate the report. The overwhelming majority view of scientists with expertise in climate change is that errors, when found, are corrected, and the issues as identified do not undermine the conclusions of the report that the climate system is warming in response to increased levels of greenhouse gases, largely due to human activities.[1]\nSome observers have identified issues in which the peer-reviewed science suggests outcomes more severe than outlined by the report, while other observers have said that some conclusions in the report are not satisfactorily supported by the peer-reviewed science. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have acknowledged that a paragraph in the WGII report on the projected date of melting of Himalayan glaciers is incorrect.[2] Climate expert Martin Parry, who had been co-chair of the working group on impacts for IPCC AR4, stated that \"What began with a single unfortunate error over Himalayan glaciers has become a clamour without substance\". The IPCC had investigated other alleged mistakes, which were \"generally unfounded and also marginal to the assessment\", and were commonly based on the mistaken idea that the IPCC could not use grey literature such as reports from campaign groups and governments.[3]\nAccording to a study conducted by the National Center for Atmospheric Research and the National Snow and Ice Data Center, Arctic Sea ice is melting faster than predicted by climate models. The study concludes that the 18 models on which the IPCC has based its current recommendations could already be out of date, and that the retreat of the ice could already be 30 years ahead of the IPCC's worst-case scenario, possibly leading to an ice-free summer Arctic before the end of the 21st century.[4]\nThe IPCC AR4 estimates explicitly exclude the influence of the melting of ice sheets.[5] These ice sheets include most notably the Greenland ice sheet, and both the east and west Antarctic ice sheets, as well as numerous glaciers. This may result in a major underestimate of the upper limit for sea level rise in the long term. Due to Arctic melting the Greenland ice sheet is particularly vulnerable, and a study by climatologist James E. Hansen states that \"we cannot rule out large changes on decadal time-scales once wide-scale surface melt is underway.\"[6] The melting of the Greenland ice sheet would result in an increase in sea level rise of over 7m.[7] Melting of the west Antarctic ice sheet would cause a similar, if slightly smaller rise in sea levels due to being grounded below sea level, whilst the effect of the melting of the east Antarctic, although less probable would be an order of magnitude greater.\nIn a lecture he gave at the University of California, Santa Barbara, James E. Hansen criticised the IPCC for its description of future sea level rise.[8] Hansen has also written on this issue:[9]\nThe IPCC [Working Group I] (2007) midrange projection for sea level rise this century is 20\u201343 cm (8\u201317 inches) and its full range is 18\u201359 cm (7\u201323 inches). The IPCC notes that they are unable to evaluate possible dynamical responses of the ice sheets, and thus do not include any possible 'rapid dynamical changes in ice flow'. Yet the provision of such specific numbers for sea level rise encourages a predictable public response that the projected sea level change is moderate, and smaller than in IPCC (2001). Indeed, there have been numerous media reports of 'reduced' sea level rise predictions, and commentators have denigrated suggestions that business-as-usual greenhouse gas emissions may cause a sea level rise of the order of meters\n... The IPCC is doing a commendable job, but we need something more. Given the reticence that the IPCC necessarily exhibits, there need to be supplementary mechanisms. The onus, it seems to me, falls on us scientists as a community.\nIn a lecture given at Princeton University, IPCC author Michael Oppenheimer admitted that the IPCC report could have better explained the contribution of melting ice sheets in predictions of sea level rise.[10] Oppenheimer said that the IPCC Working Group II Summary for Policymakers (quoted below) managed this better than the Working Group I Summary for Policymakers:[11]\nThere is medium confidence [about 5/10 chance of being correct] that at least partial deglaciation of the Greenland ice sheet, and possibly the West Antarctic ice sheet, would occur over a period of time ranging from centuries to millennia for a global average temperature increase of 1\u20134\u00b0C (relative to 1990\u20132000), causing a contribution to sea-level rise of 4\u20136 m or more.\nA paragraph in the 938-page 2007 Working Group II report (WGII) included a projection that Himalayan glaciers could disappear by 2035. This projection was not included in the final summary for policymakers which highlighted the importance of the glaciers for freshwater availability, and stated that \"Widespread mass losses from glaciers and reductions in snow cover over recent decades are projected to accelerate throughout the 21st century\". Late in 2009, in the approach to the Copenhagen climate summit, the 2035 date was strongly questioned in India. On 19 January 2010 the IPCC acknowledged that the paragraph was incorrect, while reaffirming that the conclusion in the final summary was robust. They expressed regret for \"the poor application of well-established IPCC procedures in this instance\" and their vice-chairman Jean-Pascal van Ypersele said that the reviewing procedures would have to be tightened.[2][12]\nThe WGII report (\"Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability\"), c\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Since carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, this increase has warmed the planet.\n430ppm\nJune 2025\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) is an important greenhouse gas. Greenhouse gases trap the heat from sunlight, warming the planet. Without any greenhouse gases, Earth would be too cold to support life. But the more greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere, the warmer the planet becomes.\nCarbon dioxide comes from sources such as the burning of fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, and natural gas), wildfires, and volcanic eruptions. The graph shows atmospheric CO2 levels measured by NOAA at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, since 1958. It's important to note that \u201cparts per million\u201d refers to the number of carbon dioxide molecules per million molecules of dry air. The data shown are the latest available, updated monthly.\nThe second animated graph shows CO2 levels from an Antarctic ice core in combination with the observations from Mauna Loa Observatory. This extends the record back through Earth\u2019s last three glacial cycles. The Antarctic ice core measures CO2 levels trapped in tiny air bubbles from the past that were preserved when the ice formed.\nGround-based and satellite measurements have measured a sharp increase in atmospheric CO2 in recent decades. With a more than 50% increase in CO2 since the start of industrial times in the 18th century, scientific measurements have linked this increase primarily to the burning of coal, oil, and gas. This means that CO2 levels are now 150% the value they were at in 1750 \u2014 this is at least 1.5 times greater than the natural increase observed at the end of the last ice age 20,000 years ago, which happened over thousands of years.\nThe animated map below shows the historical changes in global carbon dioxide over time. Note the colors change as the amount of CO2 rises from 365 parts per million (ppm) in 2002 to over 420 ppm in 2022. These measurements from the AIRS instrument come from the mid-troposphere, the layer of Earth's atmosphere that is 8 to 12 kilometers (about 5 to 7 miles) above the ground.\nA closer look at the carbon dioxide measurements at Mauna Loa shows a series of wiggles in the data. Although total CO2 is increasing each year, there is also a short-term cycle visible within the larger trend.\nThis annual rise and fall of CO2 levels is caused by seasonal cycles in photosynthesis on a global scale. In Northern Hemisphere spring, plants come to life and draw in CO2 to fuel their growth. This begins the process of lowering the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. In northern autumn, plant growth stops or slows down, and the whole process reverses itself. Much of the plant matter decomposes, releasing CO2 back to the atmosphere.\nA similar but less intense pattern repeats in the Southern Hemisphere in opposite seasons. Spring growth starts in September and winter decomposition begins in March, so CO2 records in the Southern Hemisphere show the opposite pattern of that seen in Mauna Loa. However, because there is a lot more land and vegetation in the Northern Hemisphere than the southern, the global yearly cycle more closely aligns with the northern seasons.\nSee the cycle in action in the visualization Watching Earth Breathe: The Seasonal Vegetation Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide.\nThis cycle of plant growth gives the graph of CO2 a sawtooth pattern of ups and downs from year to year. At a larger scale, the upward climb of the trend line over the decades is caused by CO2 emissions, primarily from burning fossil fuels. Thus, the data illustrate both natural factors and human additions of CO2.\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The onus, it seems to me, falls on us scientists as a community.\nIn a lecture given at Princeton University, IPCC author Michael Oppenheimer admitted that the IPCC report could have better explained the contribution of melting ice sheets in predictions of sea level rise.[10] Oppenheimer said that the IPCC Working Group II Summary for Policymakers (quoted below) managed this better than the Working Group I Summary for Policymakers:[11]\nThere is medium confidence [about 5/10 chance of being correct] that at least partial deglaciation of the Greenland ice sheet, and possibly the West Antarctic ice sheet, would occur over a period of time ranging from centuries to millennia for a global average temperature increase of 1\u20134\u00b0C (relative to 1990\u20132000), causing a contribution to sea-level rise of 4\u20136 m or more.\nA paragraph in the 938-page 2007 Working Group II report (WGII) included a projection that Himalayan glaciers could disappear by 2035. This projection was not included in the final summary for policymakers which highlighted the importance of the glaciers for freshwater availability, and stated that \"Widespread mass losses from glaciers and reductions in snow cover over recent decades are projected to accelerate throughout the 21st century\". Late in 2009, in the approach to the Copenhagen climate summit, the 2035 date was strongly questioned in India. On 19 January 2010 the IPCC acknowledged that the paragraph was incorrect, while reaffirming that the conclusion in the final summary was robust. They expressed regret for \"the poor application of well-established IPCC procedures in this instance\" and their vice-chairman Jean-Pascal van Ypersele said that the reviewing procedures would have to be tightened.[2][12]\nThe WGII report (\"Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability\"), c\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Right or wrong, why do so many people think he should be silenced?\nNew perk: Easily find new routes and hidden gems, upcoming running events, and more near you. Your weekly Local Running Newsletter has everything you need to lace up! Subscribe today.\nWITH HIS BEARD and tweedy jacket, Richard Lindzen looks like a cheerful physics professor from the fifties, inspiring nostalgia for the age of space exploration and other grand, forward-looking American endeavors. On a cold March evening in New London, Connecticut, the 67-year-old atmospheric scientist from MIT is trying to serve up a little optimism about the gloomiest topic of our time: global warming.\nOptimism? Yeah, as in: Don\u2019t worry about a thing. Just now, Lindzen is scoffing at the widely accepted view that CO2 buildup is to blame for the heat waves, prolonged droughts, and intense hurricanes that the U.S. and other countries have experienced in recent years. At a time when much of the nation\u2019s political, intellectual, and business leadership accepts the idea that people are the cause of global warming, Lindzen loudly disagrees.\n\u201cAll scientific issues\u2014and this is no different\u2014are difficult to understand,\u201d he tells a group of cadets and locals assembled in an auditorium at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy. \u201cExtreme weather events are always present. There\u2019s no evidence it\u2019s getting better, or worse, or changing.\u201d\nLindzen\u2019s relaxed delivery gives the audience a comfortable sense that they, like him, are smart enough to question the pronouncements of nervous scientists and high-octane advocates like Al Gore. Skepticism is a good idea, he says, since so many people who sound off about global warming don\u2019t bother to read the documents that supposedly forecast climate apocalypse. \u201cThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, if you read it\u2014and no one does \u2026\u201d he says, and that phrase alone prompts laughter.\nThis ability to put people at ease helps explain why, after nearly two decades of effort, Lindzen has achieved exalted status among the current crop of global-warming doubters. He has personally briefed President Bush\u2019s top science adviser on climate change and is very popular with senior GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill. He publishes opinion pieces in The Wall Street Journal and speaks publicly several times a month, both in the U.S. and abroad. With so many Americans searching for answers on climate change, an endowed MIT professor with pithy quotes offers a level of assurance that few can rival.\nIn doing so, however, Lindzen is challenging the scientific establishment, which tends to sing in scary harmony about this issue. The UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is an international scientific body, 2,500 researchers strong, that weighs in on the planet\u2019s climate health every five years or so. Earlier this year, the IPCC rolled out a series of three massive documents asserting that global warming is an established fact and outlining where it all will lead.\nThe reports maintain that there\u2019s more than a 90 percent chance that human activity\u2014primarily the burning of fossil fuels, resulting in increased levels of atmospheric CO2\u2014is responsible for the earth\u2019s recent warming, which amounts to a 1.2-degree-Fahrenheit rise in global mean temperature over the past 100 years. Noting that the current atmospheric concentration of CO2 is higher than it\u2019s been in the past 650,000 years, the IPCC predicts that human-induced climate change could spell extinction for 20 to 30 percent of the world\u2019s species by the end of this century, cause increasingly destructive weather patterns, and flood coastal cities.\nLindzen doesn\u2019t dispute that the planet has warmed up in the past three decades, but he argues that human-generated CO2 accounts for no more than 30 percent of this temperature rise. Much of the warming, he says, stems from fluctuations in temperature that have occurred for millions of years\u2014explained by complicated natural changes in equilibrium between the oceans and the atmosphere\u2014and the latest period of warming will not result in catastrophe.\nWhether such arguments are true, false, or nuts, they seem to make an impression on the Coast Guard crowd. Edward Hug, a Massachusetts retiree who came to hear Lindzen speak, is exactly the kind of person the professor wants to sway. Hug, who used to work in underwater acoustics for the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, says he\u2019s been diligently trying to educate himself about global warming.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen Al Gore\u2019s film twice, but I\u2019ve also read Michael Crichton\u2019s State of Fear, which makes a compelling case on the other side,\u201d says Hug, referring to the controversial 2004 novel in which Crichton\u2014using scientific arguments that were hotly challenged by critics\u2014ridiculed the global-warming consensus as the work of conspiratorial alarmists.\nHug sees the IPCC as \u201cthe closest thing to a gold standard when it comes to science,\u201d but he still wants to know whether Americans have to change their lifestyles radically in order to save the planet. \u201cThe question is,\u201d he said earlier as he settled in to hear Lindzen, \u201cis it worth making the sacrifice?\u201d\nBy evening\u2019s end, he decides to join th\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

These scientists were interested chiefly in the possibility that a lower level of carbon dioxide gas might explain the ice ages of the distant past. At the turn of the century, Svante Arrhenius calculated that emissions from human industry might someday bring a global warming. Other scientists dismissed his idea as faulty. In 1938, G.S. Callendar argued that the level of carbon dioxide was climbing and raising global temperature, but most scientists found his arguments implausible. It was almost by chance that a few researchers in the 1950s discovered that global warming truly was possible. In the early 1960s, C.D. Keeling measured the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere: it was rising fast. Researchers began to take an interest, struggling to understand how the level of carbon dioxide had changed in the past, and how the level was influenced by chemical and biological forces. By 2000, computer calculations along with evidence from ancient climates showed unequivocally that human emissions of the gas were raising Earth's temperature. Attention turned to studying how the gas was emitted or taken up by natural systems as well as by humanity, how far the temperature would rise, and what could be done to avoid disaster by curbing emissions.

One of the clearest signs is that the world is warming. Scientists know this through evidence compiled from satellites, weather balloons, thermometers, weather stations and more.1 Since 1880, average global temperatures have increased by about 1 degrees Celsius (1.7\u00b0 degrees Fahrenheit). Global temperature is projected to warm by about 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7\u00b0 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2050 and 2-4 degrees Celsius (3.6-7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100.2\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) [exit DNR], average annual global temperatures have increased steadily since the 1960s. Figure 1 shows deviations from the average global temperature depicted as the horizontal line at 0.00 degrees Celsius. Every blue bar is a year that was colder than the average temperature of the 20th century. Red bars are years that were warmer than the 20th century average. Nineteen of the 20 warmest years have occurred since 2001. It is likely that the coldest year moving forward will be warmer than the warmest year that we experienced in the 20th century.\nTo determine changes in Wisconsin temperature and precipitation, scientists from the University of Wisconsin-Madison analyzed temperature records from a statewide network compiled by the National Climatic Data Center. This dataset shows that Wisconsin has become 2 degrees Fahrenheit warmer and 4.5 inches (14 percent) wetter since the 1950s, with the greatest warming during winter and the largest precipitation increase during summer (Figure 2).\nRecordings of daily atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), initiated by Dr. Charles David Keeling of the Scripps Institute of Oceanography, help to tell the story of increasing CO2 levels. Keeling was curious whether the increasing amounts of fossil fuel being combusted would affect atmospheric CO2 levels. So, in 1958 he began to record daily atmospheric CO2 levels at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. Mauna Loa was selected as a long-term monitoring site because it was far from other continents and vegetation that could affect the CO2 concentration. The daily recordings are considered one of the world\u2019s greatest scientific contributions.\nKeeling's measurements discovered an annual planetary cycle in CO2 , in which CO2 levels rise and fall seasonally (Figure 3). This cycle is tied to photosynthesis. In the spring as plants grow, they take carbon dioxide from the air and using the energy from sunlight, convert it into carbon and release oxygen. In the fall as plants die, they release CO2 and global CO2 readings rise.\nIn addition to the seasonal cycling, Keeling also recorded an increase in CO2 concentration over time, from 313 parts per million (ppm) in 1958 to 415 ppm as of March 30, 2020. This rise in CO2 concentration, known as the Keeling Curve has transformed the way scientists understand the source of CO2\nScientists understand the source of CO2 in the atmosphere from several lines of evidence, including measurements of Antarctic ice cores that go back 800,000 years. Antarctic ice cores contain our atmosphere\u2019s history in bubbles of air that were trapped hundreds of thousands of years ago when the ice was first formed. Scientists can analyze these bubbles to determine how CO2 levels have changed over time.3 The cores show that for the last 800,000 years, until about 1900, CO2 levels were relatively stable, fluctuating between about 150 and 280 ppm. In the early 1900s, CO2 started to increase at an unprecedented rate. Today, only 120 years later, CO2 levels are 40 percent higher than they were before the industrial revolution (Figure 4).\nCO2 emissions make up the vast majority of greenhouse gases (GHG) that warm the planet. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources Air Management Program has prepared the Wisconsin Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory (1990-2021) [PDF], identifying CO2 and other GHG emissions in Wisconsin for 2005 and 2021, and describing emission trends from 1990 through 2021. Report authors used the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s State Inventory Tool populated with default data.\nResearch conducted by the Wisconsin Initiative on Climate Change Impacts (WICCI) [exit DNR], a collaboration of more than 200 scientists and practitioners, provides useful information on the impacts of climate changes, adaptive strategies and solutions to both store carbon and reduce carbon emissions. The University of Wisconsin-Madison's Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources lead WICCI.\nWICCI climate scientists have been able to project local temperature and precipitation patterns for Wisconsin. The scientists took taking global climate models that simulate climate changes on a large scale (typically 100-200 miles) and downscaled them to approximately six miles. The downscaled models have allowed scientists to forecast more realistic, localized temperature and precipitation changes, and changes in extreme weather events. WICCI scientists are continuing to work with people around the state to fine-tune these models and provide forecasts for other climate factors that are important to impacts in Wisconsin.\nWisconsin is likely to become a much warmer state over the next few decades, with average temperatures closer to southern Illinois or Missouri. Results show that Wisconsin has warmed 2 to 3 degrees Fahrenheit since 1950, and it is projected that the state will warm an additional 2 to 8 degrees by 2050 (Figure 5). We will also likely see a tripling in the frequency of extreme heat (days above 90 degrees Fahrenheit), rising from about 10 days per year in 2020 to about 30 days per year by 2050 (Figure 6).\nSeasonal temperatures have also changed. Spring temperatures have increased by 1.7 degrees Fahrenheit with the onset of spring (defined as the date when daily temperatures have reached 50 degrees Fahrenheit for 10 days in a row) coming three to 10 days earlier since 1950.

There has been considerable political controversy over a small number of errors found in the report, and there have been calls for review of the process used to formulate the report. The overwhelming majority view of scientists with expertise in climate change is that errors, when found, are corrected, and the issues as identified do not undermine the conclusions of the report that the climate system is warming in response to increased levels of greenhouse gases, largely due to human activities.[1]\nSome observers have identified issues in which the peer-reviewed science suggests outcomes more severe than outlined by the report, while other observers have said that some conclusions in the report are not satisfactorily supported by the peer-reviewed science. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have acknowledged that a paragraph in the WGII report on the projected date of melting of Himalayan glaciers is incorrect.[2] Climate expert Martin Parry, who had been co-chair of the working group on impacts for IPCC AR4, stated that \"What began with a single unfortunate error over Himalayan glaciers has become a clamour without substance\". The IPCC had investigated other alleged mistakes, which were \"generally unfounded and also marginal to the assessment\", and were commonly based on the mistaken idea that the IPCC could not use grey literature such as reports from campaign groups and governments.[3]\nAccording to a study conducted by the National Center for Atmospheric Research and the National Snow and Ice Data Center, Arctic Sea ice is melting faster than predicted by climate models. The study concludes that the 18 models on which the IPCC has based its current recommendations could already be out of date, and that the retreat of the ice could already be 30 years ahead of the IPCC's worst-case scenario, possibly leading to an ice-free summer Arctic before the end of the 21st century.[4]\nThe IPCC AR4 estimates explicitly exclude the influence of the melting of ice sheets.[5] These ice sheets include most notably the Greenland ice sheet, and both the east and west Antarctic ice sheets, as well as numerous glaciers. This may result in a major underestimate of the upper limit for sea level rise in the long term. Due to Arctic melting the Greenland ice sheet is particularly vulnerable, and a study by climatologist James E. Hansen states that \"we cannot rule out large changes on decadal time-scales once wide-scale surface melt is underway.\"[6] The melting of the Greenland ice sheet would result in an increase in sea level rise of over 7m.[7] Melting of the west Antarctic ice sheet would cause a similar, if slightly smaller rise in sea levels due to being grounded below sea level, whilst the effect of the melting of the east Antarctic, although less probable would be an order of magnitude greater.\nIn a lecture he gave at the University of California, Santa Barbara, James E.

The IPCC notes that they are unable to evaluate possible dynamical responses of the ice sheets, and thus do not include any possible 'rapid dynamical changes in ice flow'. Yet the provision of such specific numbers for sea level rise encourages a predictable public response that the projected sea level change is moderate, and smaller than in IPCC (2001).

These scientists were interested chiefly in the possibility that a lower level of carbon dioxide gas might explain the ice ages of the distant past. At the turn of the century, Svante Arrhenius calculated that emissions from human industry might someday bring a global warming. Other scientists dismissed his idea as faulty. In 1938, G.S. Callendar argued that the level of carbon dioxide was climbing and raising global temperature, but most scientists found his arguments implausible. It was almost by chance that a few researchers in the 1950s discovered that global warming truly was possible. In the early 1960s, C.D. Keeling measured the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere: it was rising fast. Researchers began to take an interest, struggling to understand how the level of carbon dioxide had changed in the past, and how the level was influenced by chemical and biological forces. By 2000, computer calculations along with evidence from ancient climates showed unequivocally that human emissions of the gas were raising Earth's temperature. Attention turned to studying how the gas was emitted or taken up by natural systems as well as by humanity, how far the temperature would rise, and what could be done to avoid disaster by curbing emissions.

Generally, warming is greater over land than over the oceans because water is slower to absorb and release heat (thermal inertia). Warming may also differ substantially within specific land masses and ocean basins.\nIn the animation at the top of the page and in the bar chart below, the years from 1880 to 1939 tend to be cooler, then level off by the 1950s. Decades within the base period (1951-1980) do not appear particularly warm or cold because they are the standard against which other years are measured.\nThe leveling off of temperatures in the middle of the 20th century can be explained by natural variability and by the cooling effects of aerosols generated by factories, power plants, and motor vehicles in the years of rapid economic growth after World War II. Fossil fuel use also increased after the war (5 percent per year), boosting greenhouse gases. Cooling from aerosol pollution happened rapidly. In contrast, greenhouse gases accumulated slowly, but they remain in the atmosphere for a much longer time. According to former GISS director James Hansen, the strong warming trend of the past four decades likely reflects a shift from balanced aerosol and greenhouse gas effects on the atmosphere to a predominance of greenhouse gas effects after aerosols were curbed by pollution controls.\nWhy should we care about one or two degrees of global warming? After all, temperatures fluctuate by many degrees every day where we live.\nThe temperatures we experience locally and in short periods can fluctuate significantly due to predictable, cyclical events (night and day, summer and winter) and hard-to-predict wind and precipitation patterns. But the global temperature mainly depends on how much energy the planet receives from the Sun and how much it radiates back into space. The energy coming from the Sun fluctuates very little by year, while the amount of energy radiated by Earth is closely tied to the chemical composition of the atmosphere\u2014particularly the amount of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.\nA one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all of the oceans, the atmosphere, and the land masses by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age. A five-degree drop was enough to bury a large part of North America under a towering mass of ice 20,000 years ago.\nGlobal temperature records start around 1880 because observations did not sufficiently cover enough of the planet prior to that time. The line plot above shows yearly temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2020 as recorded by NASA, NOAA, the Berkeley Earth research group, the Met Office Hadley Centre (United Kingdom), and the Cowtan and Way analysis. Though there are minor variations from year to year, all five records show peaks and valleys in sync with each other. All show rapid warming in the past few decades, and all show the last decade as the warmest.\nThe NASA GISS team chose the period of 1951-1980 as its baseline largely because the U.S. National Weather Service uses a three-decade period to define \u201cnormal\u201d or average temperature. The GISS temperature analysis effort also began around 1980, so the most recent 30 years was 1951-1980. Their objective is to provide an estimate of temperature change that could be compared with predictions of global climate change in response to atmospheric carbon dioxide, aerosols, and changes in solar activity.\nNASA\u2019s temperature analyses incorporate surface temperature measurements from more than 20,000 weather stations, ship- and buoy-based observations of sea surface temperatures, and temperature measurements from Antarctic research stations. These in situ measurements are analyzed using an algorithm that considers the varied spacing of temperature stations around the globe and urban heat island effects.\nSubscribe to the Earth Observatory and get the Earth in your inbox.\nNASA's Earth Observatory brings you the Earth, every day, with in-depth stories and stunning imagery.\nExplore Earth Science\nEarth Science Data\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The sun emits most of its radiation at visible and UV wavelengths. The Earth's atmosphere is fairly transparent at these wavelengths and so the Sun's radiation mostly passes through it and hits the surface. Some of this radiation (determined by the Earth's albedo) is reflected from the surface back out into space, but the rest is absorbed by the surface, which causes the surface to be warm. The surface loses heat by radiating in infra-red wavelengths. Greenhouse gases absorb some of the IR radiation, which causes the atmosphere to warm up (the GHG molecules transfer some of this heat to non-greenhouse gasses by collisions, but heat is also transferred upwards by convection). The warm atmosphere re-radiates some of this energy both upwards into space and downwards back to the surface. The part that is radiated downwards is also known as \"back-radiation\" (and is directly observable). Now the important factor is not the amount of outbound IR radiated from the surface that is absorbed, but the altitude at which there are not enough greenhouse gases above to absorb the IR radiated upwards from that layer, so that it can escape out into space. The lapse rate means that the temperature of the atmosphere decreases with increasing height. This means that the more CO2 we put into the atmosphere, the higher this emitting layer becomes, and the colder it is. As the amount of IR radiated depends on the temperature of this layer, if this height increases then the amount of IR radiated from the planet falls, leading to an energy imbalance, with the planet absorbing more of the sun's radiation than it emits as IR, and so the planet warms up. This continues until the radiating layer warms up enough for the outbound IR to be in balance with the incoming radiation from the sun. So the more CO2, the warmer the mean surface temperature, all things being otherwise equal.\nThus it is irrelevant that most IR emitted by the surface is absorbed by the atmosphere, it is the height from which IR is not absorbed that matters. If it is colder than the surface, it will emit less IR than the surface is emitting and hence less energy is radiated into space.\nFor a more detailed explanation of why absorption at the surface is of little relevance, see this RealClimate article by Spencer Weart.\nJust to add a historical note, this explanation goes back at least as far as Ekholm's paper of 1901 \"On The Variations Of The Climate Of The Geological And Historical Past And Their Causes\":\nThe atmosphere plays a very important part of a double character as to the temperature at the earth\u2019s surface, of which the one was first pointed out by Fourier, the other by Tyndall. Firstly, the atmosphere may act like the glass of a green-house, letting through the light rays of the sun relatively easily, and absorbing a great part of the dark rays emitted from the ground, and it thereby may raise the mean temperature of the earth\u2019s surface. Secondly, the atmosphere acts as a heat store placed between the relatively warm ground and the cold space, and thereby lessens in a high degree the annual, diurnal, and local variations of the temperature.\nThere are two qualities of the atmosphere that produce these effects.

One of the clearest signs is that the world is warming. Scientists know this through evidence compiled from satellites, weather balloons, thermometers, weather stations and more.1 Since 1880, average global temperatures have increased by about 1 degrees Celsius (1.7\u00b0 degrees Fahrenheit). Global temperature is projected to warm by about 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7\u00b0 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2050 and 2-4 degrees Celsius (3.6-7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100.2\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) [exit DNR], average annual global temperatures have increased steadily since the 1960s. Figure 1 shows deviations from the average global temperature depicted as the horizontal line at 0.00 degrees Celsius. Every blue bar is a year that was colder than the average temperature of the 20th century. Red bars are years that were warmer than the 20th century average. Nineteen of the 20 warmest years have occurred since 2001. It is likely that the coldest year moving forward will be warmer than the warmest year that we experienced in the 20th century.\nTo determine changes in Wisconsin temperature and precipitation, scientists from the University of Wisconsin-Madison analyzed temperature records from a statewide network compiled by the National Climatic Data Center. This dataset shows that Wisconsin has become 2 degrees Fahrenheit warmer and 4.5 inches (14 percent) wetter since the 1950s, with the greatest warming during winter and the largest precipitation increase during summer (Figure 2).\nRecordings of daily atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), initiated by Dr. Charles David Keeling of the Scripps Institute of Oceanography, help to tell the story of increasing CO2 levels. Keeling was curious whether the increasing amounts of fossil fuel being combusted would affect atmospheric CO2 levels. So, in 1958 he began to record daily atmospheric CO2 levels at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. Mauna Loa was selected as a long-term monitoring site because it was far from other continents and vegetation that could affect the CO2 concentration. The daily recordings are considered one of the world\u2019s greatest scientific contributions.\nKeeling's measurements discovered an annual planetary cycle in CO2 , in which CO2 levels rise and fall seasonally (Figure 3). This cycle is tied to photosynthesis. In the spring as plants grow, they take carbon dioxide from the air and using the energy from sunlight, convert it into carbon and release oxygen. In the fall as plants die, they release CO2 and global CO2 readings rise.\nIn addition to the seasonal cycling, Keeling also recorded an increase in CO2 concentration over time, from 313 parts per million (ppm) in 1958 to 415 ppm as of March 30, 2020. This rise in CO2 concentration, known as the Keeling Curve has transformed the way scientists understand the source of CO2\nScientists understand the source of CO2 in the atmosphere from several lines of evidence, including measurements of Antarctic ice cores that go back 800,000 years. Antarctic ice cores contain our atmosphere\u2019s history in bubbles of air that were trapped hundreds of thousands of years ago when the ice was first formed. Scientists can analyze these bubbles to determine how CO2 levels have changed over time.3 The cores show that for the last 800,000 years, until about 1900, CO2 levels were relatively stable, fluctuating between about 150 and 280 ppm. In the early 1900s, CO2 started to increase at an unprecedented rate. Today, only 120 years later, CO2 levels are 40 percent higher than they were before the industrial revolution (Figure 4).\nCO2 emissions make up the vast majority of greenhouse gases (GHG) that warm the planet. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources Air Management Program has prepared the Wisconsin Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory (1990-2021) [PDF], identifying CO2 and other GHG emissions in Wisconsin for 2005 and 2021, and describing emission trends from 1990 through 2021. Report authors used the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s State Inventory Tool populated with default data.\nResearch conducted by the Wisconsin Initiative on Climate Change Impacts (WICCI) [exit DNR], a collaboration of more than 200 scientists and practitioners, provides useful information on the impacts of climate changes, adaptive strategies and solutions to both store carbon and reduce carbon emissions. The University of Wisconsin-Madison's Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources lead WICCI.\nWICCI climate scientists have been able to project local temperature and precipitation patterns for Wisconsin. The scientists took taking global climate models that simulate climate changes on a large scale (typically 100-200 miles) and downscaled them to approximately six miles. The downscaled models have allowed scientists to forecast more realistic, localized temperature and precipitation changes, and changes in extreme weather events. WICCI scientists are continuing to work with people around the state to fine-tune these models and provide forecasts for other climate factors that are important to impacts in Wisconsin.\nWisconsin is likely to become a much warmer state over the next few decades, with average temperatures closer to southern Illinois or Missouri. Results show that Wisconsin has warmed 2 to 3 degrees Fahrenheit since 1950, and it is projected that the state will warm an additional 2 to 8 degrees by 2050 (Figure 5). We will also likely see a tripling in the frequency of extreme heat (days above 90 degrees Fahrenheit), rising from about 10 days per year in 2020 to about 30 days per year by 2050 (Figure 6).\nSeasonal temperatures have also changed. Spring temperatures have increased by 1.7 degrees Fahrenheit with the onset of spring (defined as the date when daily temperatures have reached 50 degrees Fahrenheit for 10 days in a row) coming three to 10 days earlier since 1950.

While natural variability plays some part, the preponderance of evidence indicates that human activities\u2014particularly emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases\u2014are mostly responsible for making our planet warmer.\nAccording to an ongoing temperature analysis led by scientists at NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), the average global temperature on Earth has increased by at least 1.1\u00b0 Celsius (1.9\u00b0 Fahrenheit) since 1880. The majority of the warming has occurred since 1975, at a rate of roughly 0.15 to 0.20\u00b0C per decade.\nThe maps above show temperature anomalies in five-year increments since 1880. (Click on the arrow to run the animation.) These are not absolute temperatures, but changes from the norm for each area. The data reflect how much warmer or cooler each region was compared to a base period of 1951-1980. (The global mean surface air temperature for that period was 14\u00b0C (57\u00b0F), with an uncertainty of several tenths of a degree.)\nThe image below shows global temperature anomalies in 2022, which tied for the fifth warmest year on record. The past nine years have been the warmest years since modern recordkeeping began in 1880.\nAs the maps show, global warming does not mean temperatures rise everywhere at every time by same rate. Temperatures might rise 5 degrees in one region and drop 2 degrees in another. For instance, exceptionally cold winters in one place might be balanced by extremely warm winters in another part of the world. Generally, warming is greater over land than over the oceans because water is slower to absorb and release heat (thermal inertia). Warming may also differ substantially within specific land masses and ocean basins.\nIn the animation at the top of the page and in the bar chart below, the years from 1880 to 1939 tend to be cooler, then level off by the 1950s. Decades within the base period (1951-1980) do not appear particularly warm or cold because they are the standard against which other years are measured.\nThe leveling off of temperatures in the middle of the 20th century can be explained by natural variability and by the cooling effects of aerosols generated by factories, power plants, and motor vehicles in the years of rapid economic growth after World War II. Fossil fuel use also increased after the war (5 percent per year), boosting greenhouse gases. Cooling from aerosol pollution happened rapidly. In contrast, greenhouse gases accumulated slowly, but they remain in the atmosphere for a much longer time. According to former GISS director James Hansen, the strong warming trend of the past four decades likely reflects a shift from balanced aerosol and greenhouse gas effects on the atmosphere to a predominance of greenhouse gas effects after aerosols were curbed by pollution controls.\nWhy should we care about one or two degrees of global warming? After all, temperatures fluctuate by many degrees every day where we live.\nThe temperatures we experience locally and in short periods can fluctuate significantly due to predictable, cyclical events (night and day, summer and winter) and hard-to-predict wind and precipitation patterns. But the global temperature mainly depends on how much energy the planet receives from the Sun and how much it radiates back into space. The energy coming from the Sun fluctuates very little by year, while the amount of energy radiated by Earth is closely tied to the chemical composition of the atmosphere\u2014particularly the amount of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.\nA one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all of the oceans, the atmosphere, and the land masses by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age. A five-degree drop was enough to bury a large part of North America under a towering mass of ice 20,000 years ago.\nGlobal temperature records start around 1880 because observations did not sufficiently cover enough of the planet prior to that time. The line plot above shows yearly temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2020 as recorded by NASA, NOAA, the Berkeley Earth research group, the Met Office Hadley Centre (United Kingdom), and the Cowtan and Way analysis. Though there are minor variations from year to year, all five records show peaks and valleys in sync with each other. All show rapid warming in the past few decades, and all show the last decade as the warmest.\nThe NASA GISS team chose the period of 1951-1980 as its baseline largely because the U.S. National Weather Service uses a three-decade period to define \u201cnormal\u201d or average temperature. The GISS temperature analysis effort also began around 1980, so the most recent 30 years was 1951-1980. Their objective is to provide an estimate of temperature change that could be compared with predictions of global climate change in response to atmospheric carbon dioxide, aerosols, and changes in solar activity.\nNASA\u2019s temperature analyses incorporate surface temperature measurements from more than 20,000 weather stations, ship- and buoy-based observations of sea surface temperatures, and temperature measurements from Antarctic research stations. These in situ measurements are analyzed using an algorithm that considers the varied spacing of temperature stations around the globe and urban heat island effects.\nSubscribe to the Earth Observatory and get the Earth in your inbox.\nNASA's Earth Observatory brings you the Earth, every day, with in-depth stories and stunning imagery.\nExplore Earth Science\nEarth Science Data\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Nineteen of the 20 warmest years have occurred since 2001. It is likely that the coldest year moving forward will be warmer than the warmest year that we experienced in the 20th century.\nTo determine changes in Wisconsin temperature and precipitation, scientists from the University of Wisconsin-Madison analyzed temperature records from a statewide network compiled by the National Climatic Data Center. This dataset shows that Wisconsin has become 2 degrees Fahrenheit warmer and 4.5 inches (14 percent) wetter since the 1950s, with the greatest warming during winter and the largest precipitation increase during summer (Figure 2).\nRecordings of daily atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), initiated by Dr. Charles David Keeling of the Scripps Institute of Oceanography, help to tell the story of increasing CO2 levels. Keeling was curious whether the increasing amounts of fossil fuel being combusted would affect atmospheric CO2 levels. So, in 1958 he began to record daily atmospheric CO2 levels at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. Mauna Loa was selected as a long-term monitoring site because it was far from other continents and vegetation that could affect the CO2 concentration. The daily recordings are considered one of the world\u2019s greatest scientific contributions.\nKeeling's measurements discovered an annual planetary cycle in CO2 , in which CO2 levels rise and fall seasonally (Figure 3). This cycle is tied to photosynthesis. In the spring as plants grow, they take carbon dioxide from the air and using the energy from sunlight, convert it into carbon and release oxygen. In the fall as plants die, they release CO2 and global CO2 readings rise.\nIn addition to the seasonal cycling, Keeling also recorded an increase in CO2 concentration over time, from 313 parts per million (ppm) in 1958 to 415 ppm as of March 30, 2020. This rise in CO2 concentration, known as the Keeling Curve has transformed the way scientists understand the source of CO2\nScientists understand the source of CO2 in the atmosphere from several lines of evidence, including measurements of Antarctic ice cores that go back 800,000 years. Antarctic ice cores contain our atmosphere\u2019s history in bubbles of air that were trapped hundreds of thousands of years ago when the ice was first formed. Scientists can analyze these bubbles to determine how CO2 levels have changed over time.3 The cores show that for the last 800,000 years, until about 1900, CO2 levels were relatively stable, fluctuating between about 150 and 280 ppm. In the early 1900s, CO2 started to increase at an unprecedented rate. Today, only 120 years later, CO2 levels are 40 percent higher than they were before the industrial revolution (Figure 4).\nCO2 emissions make up the vast majority of greenhouse gases (GHG) that warm the planet. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources Air Management Program has prepared the Wisconsin Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory (1990-2021) [PDF], identifying CO2 and other GHG emissions in Wisconsin for 2005 and 2021, and describing emission trends from 1990 through 2021.

While natural variability plays some part, the preponderance of evidence indicates that human activities\u2014particularly emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases\u2014are mostly responsible for making our planet warmer.\nAccording to an ongoing temperature analysis led by scientists at NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), the average global temperature on Earth has increased by at least 1.1\u00b0 Celsius (1.9\u00b0 Fahrenheit) since 1880. The majority of the warming has occurred since 1975, at a rate of roughly 0.15 to 0.20\u00b0C per decade.\nThe maps above show temperature anomalies in five-year increments since 1880. (Click on the arrow to run the animation.) These are not absolute temperatures, but changes from the norm for each area. The data reflect how much warmer or cooler each region was compared to a base period of 1951-1980. (The global mean surface air temperature for that period was 14\u00b0C (57\u00b0F), with an uncertainty of several tenths of a degree.)\nThe image below shows global temperature anomalies in 2022, which tied for the fifth warmest year on record. The past nine years have been the warmest years since modern recordkeeping began in 1880.\nAs the maps show, global warming does not mean temperatures rise everywhere at every time by same rate. Temperatures might rise 5 degrees in one region and drop 2 degrees in another. For instance, exceptionally cold winters in one place might be balanced by extremely warm winters in another part of the world. Generally, warming is greater over land than over the oceans because water is slower to absorb and release heat (thermal inertia). Warming may also differ substantially within specific land masses and ocean basins.\nIn the animation at the top of the page and in the bar chart below, the years from 1880 to 1939 tend to be cooler, then level off by the 1950s. Decades within the base period (1951-1980) do not appear particularly warm or cold because they are the standard against which other years are measured.\nThe leveling off of temperatures in the middle of the 20th century can be explained by natural variability and by the cooling effects of aerosols generated by factories, power plants, and motor vehicles in the years of rapid economic growth after World War II. Fossil fuel use also increased after the war (5 percent per year), boosting greenhouse gases. Cooling from aerosol pollution happened rapidly. In contrast, greenhouse gases accumulated slowly, but they remain in the atmosphere for a much longer time. According to former GISS director James Hansen, the strong warming trend of the past four decades likely reflects a shift from balanced aerosol and greenhouse gas effects on the atmosphere to a predominance of greenhouse gas effects after aerosols were curbed by pollution controls.\nWhy should we care about one or two degrees of global warming? After all, temperatures fluctuate by many degrees every day where we live.\nThe temperatures we experience locally and in short periods can fluctuate significantly due to predictable, cyclical events (night and day, summer and winter) and hard-to-predict wind and precipitation patterns. But the global temperature mainly depends on how much energy the planet receives from the Sun and how much it radiates back into space. The energy coming from the Sun fluctuates very little by year, while the amount of energy radiated by Earth is closely tied to the chemical composition of the atmosphere\u2014particularly the amount of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.\nA one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all of the oceans, the atmosphere, and the land masses by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age. A five-degree drop was enough to bury a large part of North America under a towering mass of ice 20,000 years ago.\nGlobal temperature records start around 1880 because observations did not sufficiently cover enough of the planet prior to that time. The line plot above shows yearly temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2020 as recorded by NASA, NOAA, the Berkeley Earth research group, the Met Office Hadley Centre (United Kingdom), and the Cowtan and Way analysis. Though there are minor variations from year to year, all five records show peaks and valleys in sync with each other. All show rapid warming in the past few decades, and all show the last decade as the warmest.\nThe NASA GISS team chose the period of 1951-1980 as its baseline largely because the U.S. National Weather Service uses a three-decade period to define \u201cnormal\u201d or average temperature. The GISS temperature analysis effort also began around 1980, so the most recent 30 years was 1951-1980. Their objective is to provide an estimate of temperature change that could be compared with predictions of global climate change in response to atmospheric carbon dioxide, aerosols, and changes in solar activity.\nNASA\u2019s temperature analyses incorporate surface temperature measurements from more than 20,000 weather stations, ship- and buoy-based observations of sea surface temperatures, and temperature measurements from Antarctic research stations. These in situ measurements are analyzed using an algorithm that considers the varied spacing of temperature stations around the globe and urban heat island effects.\nSubscribe to the Earth Observatory and get the Earth in your inbox.\nNASA's Earth Observatory brings you the Earth, every day, with in-depth stories and stunning imagery.\nExplore Earth Science\nEarth Science Data\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

They would speak regularly at ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nSingularly focused, they are credited with laying the groundwork for the shift among Senate Democrats from being climate cautious to climate advocates.\nWhen the largest climate bill in U.S. history passed the Senate this month, Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) choked back tears.\n\u201cThis is a planetary emergency, and this is the first time the federal government has taken action that is worthy of the moment,\u201d he told reporters at the time. \u201cNow I can look my kids in the eye and say we\u2019re really doing something about climate.\u201d\nFor Schatz, one of Congress\u2019s most vocal climate hawks, the moment marked the triumphant culmination of a long, treacherous effort to muscle climate legislation through the upper chamber.\n\u201cIt was relief,\u201d Schatz said in an interview. \u201cIt was a celebration of the work that everybody had done, but most importantly to me is it represented hope that the United States government can address the biggest single challenge of this political generation.\u201d\nIt was \u201ca political miracle,\u201d Schatz added.\nSchatz, 49, embodies a new type of climate hawk on Capitol Hill \u2014 one that resonates with a younger generation of climate activists determined to win buy-in not just from environmentalists but also from farmers, ranchers, Native people, labor groups, low-income communities and corporations, too. Schatz, who chairs the Indian Affairs Committee, understood that the people who are affected must be brought into the effort.\nHe doesn\u2019t do it alone. He and two of his colleagues, Sens. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), who is 50, and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), who is 66, teamed up over the past decade to craft a new model of persistent activism inside the power corridors of Congress alongside a growing climate-focused advocacy.\nAnd they still work alongside other Democrats who have long prioritized climate, including Sen. Edward J. Markey (Mass.), 76, who spearheaded the failed 2010 cap-and-trade effort and the Green New Deal, and Sen. Thomas R. Carper (Del.), 75, who chairs the Environment and Public Works Committee, and played a role in crafting the Democrats\u2019 $370 billion climate bill.\nSchatz has not attracted as much attention for his climate advocacy as Whitehouse, who has delivered nearly 300 \u201cTime to Wake Up\u201d speeches on the Senate floor to urge legislative action on global warming. But Schatz came to the Senate with climate credentials: He asked Neil Abercrombie, Hawaii\u2019s governor at the time, to appoint him to serve the rest of longtime Democratic Sen. Daniel Inouye\u2019s term after Inouye\u2019s death in 2012 because climate was Schatz\u2019s top priority.\nSchatz\u2019s arrival gave Whitehouse, elected to the Senate in 2006 and its most vocal climate activist, a more soft-spoken partner.

They would speak regularly at ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nSingularly focused, they are credited with laying the groundwork for the shift among Senate Democrats from being climate cautious to climate advocates.\nWhen the largest climate bill in U.S. history passed the Senate this month, Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) choked back tears.\n\u201cThis is a planetary emergency, and this is the first time the federal government has taken action that is worthy of the moment,\u201d he told reporters at the time. \u201cNow I can look my kids in the eye and say we\u2019re really doing something about climate.\u201d\nFor Schatz, one of Congress\u2019s most vocal climate hawks, the moment marked the triumphant culmination of a long, treacherous effort to muscle climate legislation through the upper chamber.\n\u201cIt was relief,\u201d Schatz said in an interview. \u201cIt was a celebration of the work that everybody had done, but most importantly to me is it represented hope that the United States government can address the biggest single challenge of this political generation.\u201d\nIt was \u201ca political miracle,\u201d Schatz added.\nSchatz, 49, embodies a new type of climate hawk on Capitol Hill \u2014 one that resonates with a younger generation of climate activists determined to win buy-in not just from environmentalists but also from farmers, ranchers, Native people, labor groups, low-income communities and corporations, too. Schatz, who chairs the Indian Affairs Committee, understood that the people who are affected must be brought into the effort.\nHe doesn\u2019t do it alone. He and two of his colleagues, Sens. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), who is 50, and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), who is 66, teamed up over the past decade to craft a new model of persistent activism inside the power corridors of Congress alongside a growing climate-focused advocacy.\nAnd they still work alongside other Democrats who have long prioritized climate, including Sen. Edward J. Markey (Mass.), 76, who spearheaded the failed 2010 cap-and-trade effort and the Green New Deal, and Sen. Thomas R. Carper (Del.), 75, who chairs the Environment and Public Works Committee, and played a role in crafting the Democrats\u2019 $370 billion climate bill.\nSchatz has not attracted as much attention for his climate advocacy as Whitehouse, who has delivered nearly 300 \u201cTime to Wake Up\u201d speeches on the Senate floor to urge legislative action on global warming. But Schatz came to the Senate with climate credentials: He asked Neil Abercrombie, Hawaii\u2019s governor at the time, to appoint him to serve the rest of longtime Democratic Sen. Daniel Inouye\u2019s term after Inouye\u2019s death in 2012 because climate was Schatz\u2019s top priority.\nSchatz\u2019s arrival gave Whitehouse, elected to the Senate in 2006 and its most vocal climate activist, a more soft-spoken partner. They began to strategize and plan to raise awareness and lay the foundation for legislation. They organized an overnight talk-a-thon on the Senate floor about climate in 2014 and introduced a bill to tax carbon emissions. Notably, moderate and vulnerable Democrats didn\u2019t participate and the carbon tax bill didn\u2019t go anywhere.\n\u201cThis was like before everybody was worried about climate or before climate action was cool,\u201d said Tiernen Sittenfeld, senior vice president of government affairs at the League of Conservation Voters.

For over two hours the trio discussed climate myths and conspiracy theories, many of them identical to the misinformation Lindzen and Happer were peddling well over a decade ago.\nIn this post we\u2019ll do a brief debunking of 19 of the climate myths that were raised in the podcast episode. See this article for a look at the underlying psychology and science denial techniques. Each of the 19 myths is included in a sub-section below, with the quote provided in a blue box, including a link to the timestamp in the podcast, followed by a brief debunking.\nLindzen @ 6:02: \u201cglobal mean temperature doesn't change much, but you know you focus on one degree, a half degree, so it looks like something\u201d\nLindzen @ 22:06: \u201cGutierrez at the UN says the next half degree and we're done for. I mean, doesn't anyone ask, a half degree? I mean, I deal with that between, you know, 9:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m [laughs]. Rogan: \"it does seem crazy. It's just that kind of fear of minute change that they try to put into people.\u201d\nSeemingly small changes in Earth\u2019s average global temperature represent a tremendous amount of heat energy and can cause large changes in the climate, such as extreme weather events. The last ice age was \u2018only\u2019 about 5\u00b0C colder than the recent relatively warm period, for example.\nLindzen @ 6:15: \u201c[global mean temperature] was cooling from the 1930s. 1930s were very warm and it was getting cooler until the 70s and that's why they were saying well you know this is going to lead to an ice age and they focused on that for a while.\u201d\nThe Earth\u2019s average temperature increased slightly from 1930 to 1970, by about 0.05\u00b0C, although this was less clear in the temperature data at the time. Scientists were studying competing effects resulting from the burning of fossil fuels \u2013 cooling caused by sulfate aerosols that block sunlight and are caused by sulfur dioxide pollution, and warming from carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. Some studies concluded that if sulfur dioxide emissions were to continue rising rapidly for many more decades, the resulting cooling effect could trigger an ice age. Instead, pollution regulations soon caused those emissions to decline.\nA 2008 paper that looked at the relevant research in the 1970s found that a majority of studies were predicting global warming at the time.\nLindzen @ 7:06: \"Suki Manabe showed that even though CO2 doesn't do much in the way of warming \u2013 doubling it will only give you a half degree or so \u2013 but if you assumed that relative humidity stayed constant so that every time you warmed a little you added water vapor which is a much more important greenhouse gas, you had doubled the impact of CO2 which now gives you a degree which still isn't a heck of a lot \u2026 that began the demonization of CO2.\"\nManabe helped develop the first computer climate model, which projected that a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels would result in about 2\u00b0C global warming. Manabe\u2019s modeling work was later included in the famous 1979 \u2018Charney Report,\u2019 which noted that two models developed by his team projected a 3\u00b0C northern hemisphere warming in response to a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide, and a third projected global warming of around 2\u00b0C. The Charney Report also included modeling work by James Hansen and concluded that Earth\u2019s average temperature will warm about 3\u00b0C \u00b1 1.5\u00b0C in response to doubled atmospheric CO2, which is quite close to the IPCC\u2019s latest \u2018very likely\u2019 range of 2\u20135\u00b0C.\nLindzen @ 8:10: \u201cthe energy sector is trillions of dollars. anything you can do to overturn it, change it, replace fossil fuels, it's big bucks, right?\"\nRogan @ 22:35: \u201cHow much money is involved in getting people to buy into this narrative so you can pass some bill that's called 'save the world climate,' something crazy like that\"\nNumerous fossil fuel companies are among the most profitable in the world, and the industry spent $219 million in the last U.S. election. That\u2019s about 100 times more than clean energy political action committees spent on campaign contributions over the past two years.\nLindzen @ 9:54: \"if you read the IPCC reports, they're pointing out, for instance, that water vapor and clouds are much bigger than CO2, and we don't understand them at all.\"\nThe fact that a warmer atmosphere will hold more water vapor (a result of the Clausius\u2013Clapeyron relation) and thus amplify warming caused by other greenhouse gases is well-known. As the latest IPCC report put it, \u201cGreater atmospheric water vapour content, particularly in the upper troposphere, results in enhanced absorption of [longwave] and [shortwave] radiation and reduced outgoing radiation. This is a positive feedback.\u201d\nThe IPCC report also concluded that clouds will very likely amplify global warming:\n\"The net effect of changes in clouds in response to global warming is to amplify human-induced warming, that is, the net cloud feedback is positive (high confidence) \u2026 An assessment of the low-altitude cloud feedback over the subtropical oceans, which was previously the major source of uncertainty in the net cloud feedback, is improved owing to a combined use of climate model simulations, satellite observations, and explicit simulations of clouds, altogether leading to strong evidence that this type of cloud amplifies global warming. The net cloud feedback, obtained by summing the cloud feedbacks assessed for individual regimes, is 0.42 [\u20130.10 to +0.94] W m\u20132\u00b0C\u20131.

Instead, pollution regulations soon caused those emissions to decline.\nA 2008 paper that looked at the relevant research in the 1970s found that a majority of studies were predicting global warming at the time.\nLindzen @ 7:06: \"Suki Manabe showed that even though CO2 doesn't do much in the way of warming \u2013 doubling it will only give you a half degree or so \u2013 but if you assumed that relative humidity stayed constant so that every time you warmed a little you added water vapor which is a much more important greenhouse gas, you had doubled the impact of CO2 which now gives you a degree which still isn't a heck of a lot \u2026 that began the demonization of CO2.\"\nManabe helped develop the first computer climate model, which projected that a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels would result in about 2\u00b0C global warming. Manabe\u2019s modeling work was later included in the famous 1979 \u2018Charney Report,\u2019 which noted that two models developed by his team projected a 3\u00b0C northern hemisphere warming in response to a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide, and a third projected global warming of around 2\u00b0C. The Charney Report also included modeling work by James Hansen and concluded that Earth\u2019s average temperature will warm about 3\u00b0C \u00b1 1.5\u00b0C in response to doubled atmospheric CO2, which is quite close to the IPCC\u2019s latest \u2018very likely\u2019 range of 2\u20135\u00b0C.\nLindzen @ 8:10: \u201cthe energy sector is trillions of dollars. anything you can do to overturn it, change it, replace fossil fuels, it's big bucks, right?\"\nRogan @ 22:35: \u201cHow much money is involved in getting people to buy into this narrative so you can pass some bill that's called 'save the world climate,' something crazy like that\"\nNumerous fossil fuel companies are among the most profitable in the world, and the industry spent $219 million in the last U.S. election. That\u2019s about 100 times more than clean energy political action committees spent on campaign contributions over the past two years.\nLindzen @ 9:54: \"if you read the IPCC reports, they're pointing out, for instance, that water vapor and clouds are much bigger than CO2, and we don't understand them at all.\"\nThe fact that a warmer atmosphere will hold more water vapor (a result of the Clausius\u2013Clapeyron relation) and thus amplify warming caused by other greenhouse gases is well-known. As the latest IPCC report put it, \u201cGreater atmospheric water vapour content, particularly in the upper troposphere, results in enhanced absorption of [longwave] and [shortwave] radiation and reduced outgoing radiation. This is a positive feedback.\u201d\nThe IPCC report also concluded that clouds will very likely amplify global warming:\n\"The net effect of changes in clouds in response to global warming is to amplify human-induced warming, that is, the net cloud feedback is positive (high confidence) \u2026 An assessment of the low-altitude cloud feedback over the subtropical oceans, which was previously the major source of uncertainty in the net cloud feedback, is improved owing to a combined use of climate model simulations, satellite observations, and explicit simulations of clouds, altogether leading to strong evidence that this type of cloud amplifies global warming. The net cloud feedback, obtained by summing the cloud feedbacks assessed for individual regimes, is 0.42 [\u20130.10 to +0.94] W m\u20132\u00b0C\u20131.

Human activity is the principal cause.\nEarth's climate has changed throughout history. Just in the last 800,000 years, there have been eight cycles of ice ages and warmer periods, with the end of the last ice age about 11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era \u2014 and of human civilization. Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth\u2019s orbit that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives.\nThe current warming trend is different because it is clearly the result of human activities since the mid-1800s, and is proceeding at a rate not seen over many recent millennia.1 It is undeniable that human activities have produced the atmospheric gases that have trapped more of the Sun\u2019s energy in the Earth system. This extra energy has warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land, and widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred.\nEarth-orbiting satellites and new technologies have helped scientists see the big picture, collecting many different types of information about our planet and its climate all over the world.

Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly 10 times faster than the average rate of warming after an ice age. Carbon dioxide from human activities is increasing about 250 times faster than it did from natural sources after the last Ice Age.3\nThe planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and other human activities.4 Most of the warming occurred in the past 40 years, with the seven most recent years being the warmest.
