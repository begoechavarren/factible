Their citizens had piles, boxes, or wheelbarrows full of money, yet they were not able to buy anything because prices had gotten so high! At such high inflation rates, the economy tends to break down. The Federal Reserve works to control inflation to provide our country with a stable economy.\nThe US government established the Federal Reserve to foster economic prosperity and social welfare. Part of the mission Congress has given to the Federal Reserve is to keep prices stable. This means not letting prices rise or fall too quickly.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which is the part of the Federal Reserve that sets monetary policy, sees 2 percent as the right amount of inflation. The FOMC uses annual changes in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) as its preferred measure of inflation.\nThe Federal Reserve seeks to control inflation by influencing interest rates. When inflation is too high, the Federal Reserve typically raises interest rates to slow the economy and bring inflation down. When inflation is too low, the Federal Reserve typically lowers interest rates to stimulate the economy and move inflation higher.\nThe Center\u2019s newsletter provides inflation-related information from the Cleveland Fed.

There are ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nOn Sept. 13, 2022, the U.S. Census Bureau will release income and earnings estimates for 2021, using data from the 2022 Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS ASEC). In the report, Income in the United States: 2021, the Census Bureau will compare estimates of median income and earnings between 2020 and 2021 and present historical income and earnings estimates dating back to 1967.\nTo account for changes in the cost of living, the Census Bureau adjusts all prior year income and earnings estimates for inflation. There are numerous price indexes available to the Census Bureau to use for this adjustment. The Census Bureau currently uses the Consumer Price Index Retroactive Series for all Urban Consumers All Items (R-CPI-U-RS), produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (formerly known as the Consumer Price Index Research Series [CPI-U-RS]).\nAccording to this index, prices increased by 4.7% between 2020 and 2021. This is the largest annual increase in the inflation rate since 1990.\nInflation has increased more rapidly in 2022. Over the first seven months of 2022, inflation rose 5.4%. Between July 2021 and July 2022, inflation increased 8.5%.\nSince income estimates released in September reflect annual income in the prior calendar year, the Census Bureau\u2019s inflation adjustment does not account for the additional price increases experienced in 2022. Those changes will be reflected in the inflation-adjusted estimates of income released in next year\u2019s report.\nIn nominal terms, meaning unadjusted for inflation, the median income for all U.S. households in 2020 was $68,010. In real terms, meaning adjusted to 2021 dollars, median income in 2020 was $71,186. The difference (4.7%) reflects the inflation rate between 2020 and 2021. When the Census Bureau releases income and earnings statistics for 2021, the estimated change in income and earnings between 2020 and 2021 will compare the 2021 nominal estimates to the real 2020 estimates (adjusted to 2021 dollars). The difference between the adjusted 2020 and unadjusted 2021 estimates reflects the change in real income and earnings between the two years.\nAs mentioned, the Census Bureau currently uses R-CPI-U-RS. The Census Bureau is considering whether to use price indexes that better account for how households adjust consumption when relative prices change.

Their citizens had piles, boxes, or wheelbarrows full of money, yet they were not able to buy anything because prices had gotten so high! At such high inflation rates, the economy tends to break down. The Federal Reserve works to control inflation to provide our country with a stable economy.\nThe US government established the Federal Reserve to foster economic prosperity and social welfare. Part of the mission Congress has given to the Federal Reserve is to keep prices stable. This means not letting prices rise or fall too quickly.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which is the part of the Federal Reserve that sets monetary policy, sees 2 percent as the right amount of inflation. The FOMC uses annual changes in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) as its preferred measure of inflation.\nThe Federal Reserve seeks to control inflation by influencing interest rates. When inflation is too high, the Federal Reserve typically raises interest rates to slow the economy and bring inflation down. When inflation is too low, the Federal Reserve typically lowers interest rates to stimulate the economy and move inflation higher.\nThe Center\u2019s newsletter provides inflation-related information from the Cleveland Fed.

Inflation cannot be measured by an increase in the cost of one product or service, or even several products or services. Rather, inflation is a general increase in the overall price level of the goods and services in the economy.\nFederal Reserve policymakers evaluate changes in inflation by monitoring several different price indexes. A price index measures changes in the price of a group of goods and services. The Fed considers several price indexes because different indexes track different products and services and because indexes are calculated differently. Therefore, various indexes can send diverse signals about inflation.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has affirmed that an annual increase in inflation of 2 percent in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), produced by the Department of Commerce, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve's mandate for maximum employment and price stability. When households and businesses can reasonably expect inflation to remain low and stable, they are able to make sound decisions regarding saving, borrowing, and investment, which contribute to a well-functioning economy and the well-being of all Americans.\nThe FOMC uses the PCE price index largely because it covers a wide range of household spending. However, the Fed closely tracks other inflation measures as well, including the consumer price indexes and producer price indexes issued by the Department of Labor.\nWhen evaluating the rate of inflation, Federal Reserve policymakers also take the following steps:\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. \"Median CPI & Inflation Measurement.\" (See information on the trimmed-mean consumer price index.)\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas. \"Trimmed Mean PCE Inflation Rate.\"\nU.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis. \"National Economic Accounts.\" (See information on price indexes for personal consumption expenditures under the headings Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Personal Income and Outlays.)\nU.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. \"Consumer Price Index.\"\nU.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. \"Producer Price Indexes.\"\nWhat is the difference between monetary policy and fiscal policy, and how are they related?\nWhy do interest rates matter?\nWhy does the Federal Reserve aim for 2 percent inflation over time?\nBOARD OF GOVERNORS of the FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM\n20th Street and Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, DC 20551\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

When ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nSeptember 23, 2025\nPersonal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation is expected to be 2.7 percent over the 12 months ended in August 2025 and has been above the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s 2 percent target since early 2021. (We estimate August PCE inflation using the August Consumer Price Index and producer price index.)\nTo better assess the underlying momentum in price changes, volatile items are often omitted from the inflation calculation. Core PCE, which excludes food and energy items, is expected be 2.9 percent in August and has steadied above 2.5 percent since mid-2024.\nWhen thinking about where inflation is headed, it is helpful to consider the inflation rates of different categories within the consumption basket. A common way of categorizing core PCE inflation is by core goods (goods apart from food and energy items), housing services (rent and owner\u2019s equivalent rent) and non-housing core services (all services apart from housing and energy services) (Chart 1).\nOver the past year, core goods prices have increased around 1.2 percent. They carry a weight of about 30 percent in the overall core PCE basket and have contributed around 0.3 percentage points to core PCE. Housing inflation has been around 3.8 percent, with a weight of around 15 percent and a contribution of around 0.7 percentage points. Non-housing core services prices have increased around 3.3 percent, have a weight of about 55 percent and contributed 1.9 percentage points.\nThe fact that non-housing core services inflation had the largest contribution over the past 12 months doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it is more of a problem than the other categories, since there are typical differences in the inflation rates of the three categories. Those differences are driven by long-run changes in their relative prices.\nGoods, for example, have tended to become cheaper relative to services, so core goods inflation has typically run several percentage points below services inflation. Figuring out the degree of \u201cexcess\u201d inflation in a given category requires a comparison to a benchmark rate.\nAnalysts often compare the current contribution of each category to an average over some period to calculate excess contributions. The several years before the pandemic, 2017\u201319, is a natural benchmark, though actual inflation averaged only 1.7 percent over this period.\nA category could contribute 0.3 percentage points above this baseline and still be consistent with 2 percent inflation, as long as the other categories return to their 2017\u201319 averages. One could pick a period when inflation averaged near 2.0 percent, such as 1989\u20132019 or 2002\u201307, but those periods may not be representative of conditions that are likely to hold going forward.\nAn alternative approach that doesn\u2019t rely on picking a specific period when inflation averaged 2 percent is to consider the behavior of relative prices. Chart 2 plots the gap between non-housing core services inflation and core goods inflation.\nChart 3 plots the gap between housing and core goods.\nThese gaps are essentially changes in the relative prices of housing and non-housing core services in terms of core goods. Assuming the gaps between these inflation rates will converge to some constants (\u03c0h \u2013 \u03c0g = chg,\u03c0s \u2013 \u03c0g = csg) and core inflation (the expenditure-share-weighted average of the three core components) equals 2.0 percent (\u03c0 = wg\u03c0g + wh\u03c0h + ws\u03c0s = 2) results in a system of three equations in the three unknown inflation rates. The 2.0-percent-consistent rate for each category can then be backed out.\nTable 1 shows the average 2.0-percent-core-inflation-consistent rates and excess contributions using various periods over which the relative inflation rates are averaged.\nUsing the longest average possible of relative price changes, 1960\u20132025, both core goods and non-housing core services are contributing around 0.3 percentage points above what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation, while housing\u2019s excess contribution is around 0.2 percentage points.\nAcceleration in prices for core goods this year has been widely attributed to increased tariffs. If tariffs have only a one-time impact on the level of core goods prices, as most forecasters expect, excess inflation from this category can reasonably be expected to fade over the coming couple of years. Similarly, the 0.2 percentage point excess contribution from housing can be expected to fade based on forecasts using market rents that have been reliable in recent years.\nIf core goods and housing inflation slow as expected, a 0.3-percentage-point excess contribution from non-housing core services would be left. It is less clear that this inflation rate is propped up by temporary factors or set to slow significantly further.\nThe next three columns in Table 1 consider alternative periods to average the relative price changes. The period 1985\u20132019 is a common estimation sample as it featured relatively low and less volatile inflation following the disinflation under Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker but before the pandemic shock.\nStatistical tests for break points in the relative inflation rates find evidence for a break around 1976 for housing inflation relative to core goods, which can be seen in Chart 3, as well as a break in 2009 for non-housing core services relative to goods. Columns 3 and 4 use the averages only after these periods. The takeaway from all four columns is roughly similar: 0.3 to 0.4 percentage points of excess inflation from non-housing core services.\nThe last column considers the 2002\u201307 period as a benchmark. Some analysts have used this benchmark to calculate excess contributions because core inflation averaged near 2.0 percent over that time. Under this benchmark, primarily core goods are a concern, with non-housing core services inflation already near its 2-percent-consistent pace.\nHowever, the data in Charts 1 and 2 suggest the behavior of relative prices at that time may not be broadly applicable.
