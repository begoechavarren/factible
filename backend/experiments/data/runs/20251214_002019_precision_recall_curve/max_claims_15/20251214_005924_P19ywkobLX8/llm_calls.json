    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nHubris is a Greek word that means dangerously overconfident. Based on my research, hubris fairly describes our current response to the issue of climate change. Here\u2019s what many people believe: One: The planet is warming catastrophically because of certain human behaviors. Two: Thanks to powerful computers we can project what the climate will be like 20, 40, or even 100 years from now. Three: That if we eliminate just one behavior, the burning of fossil fuels, we can prevent the climate from changing for as long we like. Each of these presumptions\u2014together, the basis of our hubris regarding the changing climate\u2014is either untrue or so far off the mark as to be useless. Yes, it\u2019s true that the globe is warming, and that humans are exerting a warming influence upon it. But beyond that, to paraphrase a line from the classic movie The Princess Bride, \u201cI do not think \u2018The Science\u2019 says what you think it says.\u201d For example, government reports state clearly that heat waves in the US are now no more common than they were in 1900. Hurricane activity is no different than it was a century ago. Floods have not increased across the globe over more than seventy years. Greenland\u2019s ice sheet isn\u2019t shrinking any more rapidly today than it was 80 years ago. Why aren\u2019t these reassuring facts better known? Because the public gets its climate information almost exclusively from the media. And from a media perspective, fear sells. \u201cThings aren\u2019t that bad\u201d doesn\u2019t sell. Very few people, and that includes journalists who report on climate news, read the actual science. I have. And what the data\u2014the hard science\u2014from the US government and UN Climate reports say is that\u2026 \u201cthings aren\u2019t that bad.\u201d Nor does the public understand the questionable basis of all catastrophic climate change projections: computer modeling. Projecting future climate is excruciatingly difficult. Yes, there are human influences, but the climate is complex. Anyone who says that climate models are \u201cjust physics\u201d either doesn\u2019t understand them or is being deliberately misleading. I should know: I wrote one of the first textbooks on computer modeling. While modelers base their assumptions upon both fundamental physical laws and observations of the climate, there is still considerable judgment involved. And since different modelers will make different assumptions, results vary widely among different models. Let\u2019s just take one simple, but significant assumption modelers must make: the impact of clouds on the climate. Natural fluctuations in the height and coverage of clouds have at least as much of an impact on the flows of sunlight and heat as do human influences. But how can we possibly know global cloud coverage say 10, let alone 50 years from now? Obviously, we can\u2019t. But to create a climate model, we have to make assumptions. That\u2019s a pretty shaky foundation on which to transform the world\u2019s economy. By the way, creating more accurate models isn\u2019t getting any easier. In fact, the more we learn about the climate system, the more we realize how complex it is. Rather than admit this complexity, the media, the politicians, and a good portion of the climate science community attribute every terrible storm, every flood, every major fire to \u201cclimate change.\u201d Yes, we\u2019ve always had these weather events in the past, the narrative goes, but somehow \u201cclimate change\u201d is making everything \u201cworse.\u201d Even if that were true, isn\u2019t the relevant question, how much worse? Not to mention that \u201cworse\u201d is not exactly a scientific term. And how would we make it better? For the alarmists, that\u2019s easy: we get rid of fossil fuels. Not only is this impractical\u2014we get over 80% of the world\u2019s energy from fossil fuels\u2014it\u2019s not scientifically possible. That\u2019s because CO2 doesn\u2019t disappear from the atmosphere in a few days like, say, smog. It hangs around for a really long time. About 60 percent of any CO2 that we emit today will remain in the atmosphere 20 years from now, between 30 and 55 percent will still be there after a century, and between 15 and 30 percent will remain after one thousand years. In other words, it takes centuries for the excess carbon dioxide to vanish from the atmosphere. So, any partial reductions in CO2 emissions would only slow the increase in human influences\u2014not prevent it, let alone reverse it. CO2 is not a knob that we can just turn down to fix everything. We don\u2019t have that ability. To think that we do is\u2026 hubris. Hubris leads to bad decisions. A little humility and a little knowledge would lead to better ones.

The record consumption was driven by a spike in energy demand, more than half of which came from the Global South, where energy demand is growing at twice the global rate.\nBut this is not the only energy record that was broke last year \u2013 the hottest year in history. According to the 73rd annual edition of the Statistical Review of World Energy released last week, the increase in fossil fuel consumption \u2013 coal in particular \u2013 led to 40 gigatonnes carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, the highest level ever recorded, up 2% from 2022.\nEarlier this year, the International Energy Agency partly blamed the rise in CO2 emissions on a drought-driven shortfall in hydropower generation. Without it, the agency said, global emissions would have likely declined last year.\nCoal, the cheapest and dirtiest fossil fuel, is the single-largest source of carbon emissions, responsible for over 0.3C of the 1.2C increase in global average temperatures since the Industrial Revolution. It is also a major contributor to air pollution.\nDespite the negative global trend, not every country ramped up fossil fuel prouction. In Europe, fossil fuels dipped below 70% for the first time ever, while in the US \u2013 which remains the world\u2019s third-largest consumer of coal \u2013 consumption of the fuel has halved in the last decade. These changes also led to a significant decrease in CO2 emissions in both regions: 6.6% in the EU and 2.7 in the US.\nLeading coal consumption globally are China, which burns more coal than the rest of the world combined, and India, which is now burning more coal than Europe and North America combined.\nOn the other hand, China is also leading the global renewable race . The nation accounted for 55% of all renewable energy additions in 2023, more than the rest of the world combined. This presents a real opportunity to triple global capacity by 2030, a target set at last November\u2019s UN climate summit COP28 in Dubai. And yet, clean energy sources still only accounted for 15% of the world\u2019s energy mix last year \u2013 a record high but far from what is needed to curb global warming. Solar and wind made up 8% of the total.\nSpeaking with the Financial Times, chief executive of the London-based Energy Institute Nick Wayth said the world still has a long way to go before renewables dominate energy mix. \u201cClean energy is still not even meeting the entirety of demand growth,\u201d he said. \u201cArguably, the [energy] transition has not even started.\u201d\n\u201cIn a year where we have seen the contribution of renewables reaching a new record high, ever increasing global energy demand means the share coming from fossil fuels has remained virtually unchanged at just over 80% for yet another year,\u201d said Simon Virley Vice Chair and Head of Energy and Natural Resources at KPMG in the UK. \u201cWith CO2 emissions also reaching record levels, it\u2019s time to redouble our efforts on reducing carbon emissions and providing finance and capacity to build more low carbon energy sources in the global south where demand is growing at a rapid pace.\u201d\nStill, there is reason to be optimistic, with the IEA forecasting $2 trillion in clean energy technologies and infrastructure investments this year, nearly double the amount going to planet-warming fossil fuels.

About 90% of this heat is then absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-radiated, slowing heat loss to space.\nA vital component of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide (CO2) is released through natural processes (like volcanic eruptions) and through human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation.\nLike many atmospheric gases, methane comes from both natural and human-caused sources. Methane comes from plant-matter breakdown in wetlands and is also released from landfills and rice farming. Livestock animals emit methane from their digestion and manure. Leaks from fossil fuel production and transportation are another major source of methane, and natural gas is 70% to 90% methane.\nA potent greenhouse gas produced by farming practices, nitrous oxide is released during commercial and organic fertilizer production and use. Nitrous oxide also comes from burning fossil fuels and burning vegetation and has increased by 18% in the last 100 years.\nThese chemical compounds do not exist in nature \u2013 they are entirely of industrial origin. They were used as refrigerants, solvents (a substance that dissolves others), and spray can propellants.\nFORCING: Something acting upon Earth's climate that causes a change in how energy flows through it (such as long-lasting, heat-trapping gases - also known as greenhouse gases). These gases slow outgoing heat in the atmosphere and cause the planet to warm.\nWater vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas, but because the warming ocean increases the amount of it in our atmosphere, it is not a direct cause of climate change. Credit: John Fowler on Unsplash\nFEEDBACKS: A process where something is either amplified or reduced as time goes on, such as water vapor increasing as Earth warms leading to even more warming.\nOver the last century, burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). This increase happens because the coal or oil burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the air to make CO2. To a lesser extent, clearing of land for agriculture, industry, and other human activities has increased concentrations of greenhouse gases.\nThe industrial activities that our modern civilization depends upon have raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels by nearly 50% since 17502. This increase is due to human activities, because scientists can see a distinctive isotopic fingerprint in the atmosphere.\nIn its Sixth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, composed of scientific experts from countries all over the world, concluded that it is unequivocal that the increase of CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere over the industrial era is the result of human activities and that human influence is the principal driver of many changes observed across the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nThe panel's AR6 Working Group I (WGI) Summary for Policymakers report is online at https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/.\nScientists use a metric called Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) to measure the changes in energy the Earth receives from the Sun. TSI incorporates the 11-year solar cycle and solar flares/storms from the Sun's surface.\nStudies show that solar variability has played a role in past climate changes. For example, a decrease in solar activity coupled with increased volcanic activity helped trigger the Little Ice Age.\nBut several lines of evidence show that current global warming cannot be explained by changes in energy from the Sun:\n1.

Now, a professor at New York University and a fellow at the Hoover Institution, Steven Koonin received a Bachelor of science degree at Caltech and a doctorate in physics at MIT. During a career in which he published more than 200 peer reviewed scientific papers and a textbook on computational physics, Dr. Koonin rose to become Provost of Caltech. In 2009, president Obama appointed him under Secretary of Science at the Department of Energy, a position Dr. Koonin held for some two and a half years, during which he found himself shocked by the misuse of climate science in politics and the press. In 2021, Dr. Koonin published Unsettled, What Climate Science Tells Us, What It Doesn't, and Why it Matters. Steven Koonin, welcome.\nSteven Koonin: Wonderful to be talking with you Peter.\nPeter Robinson: The shaken secretary, in Unsettled you write of a 2014 workshop for the American Physical Society, which means it's you and a bunch of other people who I cannot even begin to follow, serious professional scientists in which you and several colleagues were asked to subject current climate science to a stress test, to push it, to prod it, to test it, to see how good it was. From Unsettled and I'm quoting you now Steve. \"I'm a scientist. I work to understand the world through measurements and observations. I came away from the workshop not only surprised, but shaken by the realization that climate science was far less mature than I had supposed.\" Close quote. Well, let's start with the end of that. What had you supposed?\nSteven Koonin: Well, I had supposed that humans were warming the globe. Carbon dioxide was accumulating in the atmosphere causing all kinds of trouble, melting ice caps, warming oceans, and so on. And the data didn't support a lot of that. And the projections of what would happen in the future relied on models that were, let's say, shaky at best.\nPeter Robinson: All right. Former Senator John Kerry is now President Biden's Special Envoy for Climate. Let me quote you. This is John Kerry in a 2021 address to the United States, I beg your pardon, to the UN Security Council. John Kerry, 2021 to the UN Security Council, quote, \"Net-zero emissions by 2050 or earlier is the only way that science tells us we can limit this planet's warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Why is that so crucial?\" I'm still quoting Kerry. \"Because overwhelming evidence tells us that anything more will have catastrophic implications. We are marching forward in what is tantamount to a mutual suicide pact.\" Close quote. Overwhelming evidence, science tells us, what's wrong with that?\nSteven Koonin: Well, you should look at the actual science, which I suspect that Ambassador Kerry has not done. You know, the UN puts out every five or six years assessment reports that are the IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change that are meant to survey, assess, and summarize the state of our knowledge about the climate. The most recent one came out about a year ago in 2022. Previous one came out in 2014 or so, and when you read those reports, they're massive. The latest one is 3000 pages and it took 300 scientists a couple years to write. And you really need to be a scientist to understand them. Even as I started to dig into climate science, I got a background in theoretical physics. I can understand this stuff. It took me a couple years to really understand what goes on. Now, ambassador Kerry, other politicians certainly have not done that. But when he's getting his information perhaps from the summary for policy makers in those reports, or more likely for an even further boil down version. And as you boil down the good assessment into the summary, into more condensed versions, there's plenty of room for mischief. And that mischief is evident when you compare what comes out at the end of that game of telephone with what the actual science really is.\nPeter Robinson: All right. Now what we know and what we don't, let's start with what we know. Unsettled, I'm quoting you again Steve. Not everything you've heard about climate science is wrong.

Since carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, this increase has warmed the planet.\n430ppm\nJune 2025\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) is an important greenhouse gas. Greenhouse gases trap the heat from sunlight, warming the planet. Without any greenhouse gases, Earth would be too cold to support life. But the more greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere, the warmer the planet becomes.\nCarbon dioxide comes from sources such as the burning of fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, and natural gas), wildfires, and volcanic eruptions. The graph shows atmospheric CO2 levels measured by NOAA at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, since 1958. It's important to note that \u201cparts per million\u201d refers to the number of carbon dioxide molecules per million molecules of dry air. The data shown are the latest available, updated monthly.\nThe second animated graph shows CO2 levels from an Antarctic ice core in combination with the observations from Mauna Loa Observatory. This extends the record back through Earth\u2019s last three glacial cycles. The Antarctic ice core measures CO2 levels trapped in tiny air bubbles from the past that were preserved when the ice formed.\nGround-based and satellite measurements have measured a sharp increase in atmospheric CO2 in recent decades. With a more than 50% increase in CO2 since the start of industrial times in the 18th century, scientific measurements have linked this increase primarily to the burning of coal, oil, and gas. This means that CO2 levels are now 150% the value they were at in 1750 \u2014 this is at least 1.5 times greater than the natural increase observed at the end of the last ice age 20,000 years ago, which happened over thousands of years.\nThe animated map below shows the historical changes in global carbon dioxide over time. Note the colors change as the amount of CO2 rises from 365 parts per million (ppm) in 2002 to over 420 ppm in 2022. These measurements from the AIRS instrument come from the mid-troposphere, the layer of Earth's atmosphere that is 8 to 12 kilometers (about 5 to 7 miles) above the ground.\nA closer look at the carbon dioxide measurements at Mauna Loa shows a series of wiggles in the data. Although total CO2 is increasing each year, there is also a short-term cycle visible within the larger trend.\nThis annual rise and fall of CO2 levels is caused by seasonal cycles in photosynthesis on a global scale. In Northern Hemisphere spring, plants come to life and draw in CO2 to fuel their growth. This begins the process of lowering the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. In northern autumn, plant growth stops or slows down, and the whole process reverses itself. Much of the plant matter decomposes, releasing CO2 back to the atmosphere.\nA similar but less intense pattern repeats in the Southern Hemisphere in opposite seasons. Spring growth starts in September and winter decomposition begins in March, so CO2 records in the Southern Hemisphere show the opposite pattern of that seen in Mauna Loa. However, because there is a lot more land and vegetation in the Northern Hemisphere than the southern, the global yearly cycle more closely aligns with the northern seasons.\nSee the cycle in action in the visualization Watching Earth Breathe: The Seasonal Vegetation Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide.\nThis cycle of plant growth gives the graph of CO2 a sawtooth pattern of ups and downs from year to year. At a larger scale, the upward climb of the trend line over the decades is caused by CO2 emissions, primarily from burning fossil fuels. Thus, the data illustrate both natural factors and human additions of CO2.\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Over the last century, burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nClimate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. Such shifts can be natural, due to changes in the sun\u2019s activity or large volcanic eruptions. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.\nBurning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun\u2019s heat and raising temperatures.\nThe main greenhouse gases that are causing climate change include carbon dioxide and methane. These come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example. Clearing land and cutting down forests can also release carbon dioxide. Agriculture, oil and gas operations are major sources of methane emissions. Energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main sectors causing greenhouse gases.\nClimate scientists have showed that humans are responsible for virtually all global heating over the last 200 years. Human activities like the ones mentioned above are causing greenhouse gases that are warming the world faster than at any time in at least the last two thousand years.\nThe average temperature of the Earth\u2019s surface is now about 1.42\u00b0C warmer than it was in the late 1800s-prior to the industrial revolution-and warmer than at any time in the last 100,000 years. The last decade (2015-2024) was the warmest on record, and each of the last four decades has been warmer than any previous decade since 1850.\nMany people think that climate change mainly means warmer temperatures. But temperature rise is only the beginning of the story. Because the Earth is a system where everything is connected, changes in one area can influence changes in all others.\nThe consequences of climate change include, among others, intense droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice, catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.\nClimate change can affect our health, ability to grow food, housing, safety and work. Some of us are already more vulnerable to climate impacts, such as people living in small island nations and other developing countries. Conditions like sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion have advanced to the point where entire communities have had to relocate, while protracted droughts are putting people at risk of famine. In the future, the number of people displaced by weather-related events is expected to rise.\nIn a series of UN reports, thousands of scientists and government reviewers agreed that limiting global temperature rise to no more than 1.5\u00b0C would help us avoid the worst climate impacts and maintain a liveable climate. Yet policies currently in place point to up to 2.8\u00b0C of warming by the end of the century.\nThe emissions that cause climate change come from every part of the world and affect everyone, but some countries produce much more than others. The six biggest emitters (China, the United States of America, India, the European Union, the Russian Federation, and Indonesia) together account for more than half of all global greenhouse gas emissions. By contrast, the 45 least developed countries contribute only 3 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.\nEveryone must take climate action, but people and countries creating more of the problem have a greater responsibility to act first.\nMany climate change solutions can deliver economic benefits while improving our lives and protecting the environment. We also have global frameworks and agreements to guide progress, such as the Sustainable Development Goals, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. Three broad categories of action are: cutting emissions, adapting to climate impacts and financing required adjustments.\nSwitching energy systems from fossil fuels to renewables like solar or wind will reduce the emissions driving climate change. But we have to act now. While a growing number of countries is committing to net zero emissions by 2050, emissions must be cut in half by 2030 to keep warming below 1.5\u00b0C. Achieving this means huge declines in the use of coal, oil and gas: production and consumption of all fossil fuels need to be cut by at least 30 per cent by 2030 in order to prevent catastrophic levels of climate change.\nAdapting to climate consequences protects people, homes, businesses, livelihoods, infrastructure and natural ecosystems. It covers current impacts and those likely in the future. Adaptation will be required everywhere but must be prioritized now for the most vulnerable people with the fewest resources to cope with climate hazards. The rate of return can be high. Early warning systems for disasters, for instance, save lives and property, and can deliver benefits up to 10 times the initial cost.\nClimate action requires significant financial investments by governments and businesses. But climate inaction is vastly more expensive. One critical step is for developed countries to support developing countries so they can adapt and move towards greener economies.\nTo get familiar with some of the more technical terms used in connection with climate change, consult the Climate Dictionary.\nClimate change is a hot topic \u2013 with myths and falsehoods circulating widely.

Agriculture, oil and gas operations are major sources of methane emissions. Energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main sectors causing greenhouse gases.\nClimate scientists have showed that humans are responsible for virtually all global heating over the last 200 years. Human activities like the ones mentioned above are causing greenhouse gases that are warming the world faster than at any time in at least the last two thousand years.\nThe average temperature of the Earth\u2019s surface is now about 1.42\u00b0C warmer than it was in the late 1800s-prior to the industrial revolution-and warmer than at any time in the last 100,000 years. The last decade (2015-2024) was the warmest on record, and each of the last four decades has been warmer than any previous decade since 1850.\nMany people think that climate change mainly means warmer temperatures. But temperature rise is only the beginning of the story. Because the Earth is a system where everything is connected, changes in one area can influence changes in all others.\nThe consequences of climate change include, among others, intense droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice, catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.\nClimate change can affect our health, ability to grow food, housing, safety and work. Some of us are already more vulnerable to climate impacts, such as people living in small island nations and other developing countries.

We also have global frameworks and agreements to guide progress, such as the Sustainable Development Goals, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. Three broad categories of action are: cutting emissions, adapting to climate impacts and financing required adjustments.\nSwitching energy systems from fossil fuels to renewables like solar or wind will reduce the emissions driving climate change. But we have to act now. While a growing number of countries is committing to net zero emissions by 2050, emissions must be cut in half by 2030 to keep warming below 1.5\u00b0C.

In this wide-ranging discussion, based in part on his 2021 book, Unsettled: What Climate Science Tells Us, What It Doesn't, and Why It Matters, Koonin gives a more refined look at the science behind the climate issue than the media typically offers, guiding us through the evidence and its implications. As Koonin explains in this interview, he was \u201cshaken by the realization that climate science was far less mature than I had supposed\u201d and that the \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d of catastrophic implications of anthropogenic global warming wasn\u2019t so overwhelming after all.\nTo view the full transcript of this episode, read below:\nPeter Robinson: A scientist who's skeptical about climate science, or at least about a lot of what passes for climate science, which would of course make him another crackpot conservative, or not. He served as under Secretary of the Department of Energy in the Obama administration, Stephen Koonin, on Uncommon Knowledge now. Welcome to Uncommon Knowledge. I'm Peter Robinson. Now, a professor at New York University and a fellow at the Hoover Institution, Steven Koonin received a Bachelor of science degree at Caltech and a doctorate in physics at MIT. During a career in which he published more than 200 peer reviewed scientific papers and a textbook on computational physics, Dr. Koonin rose to become Provost of Caltech. In 2009, president Obama appointed him under Secretary of Science at the Department of Energy, a position Dr. Koonin held for some two and a half years, during which he found himself shocked by the misuse of climate science in politics and the press. In 2021, Dr. Koonin published Unsettled, What Climate Science Tells Us, What It Doesn't, and Why it Matters. Steven Koonin, welcome.\nSteven Koonin: Wonderful to be talking with you Peter.\nPeter Robinson: The shaken secretary, in Unsettled you write of a 2014 workshop for the American Physical Society, which means it's you and a bunch of other people who I cannot even begin to follow, serious professional scientists in which you and several colleagues were asked to subject current climate science to a stress test, to push it, to prod it, to test it, to see how good it was. From Unsettled and I'm quoting you now Steve. \"I'm a scientist. I work to understand the world through measurements and observations. I came away from the workshop not only surprised, but shaken by the realization that climate science was far less mature than I had supposed.\" Close quote. Well, let's start with the end of that. What had you supposed?\nSteven Koonin: Well, I had supposed that humans were warming the globe. Carbon dioxide was accumulating in the atmosphere causing all kinds of trouble, melting ice caps, warming oceans, and so on. And the data didn't support a lot of that. And the projections of what would happen in the future relied on models that were, let's say, shaky at best.\nPeter Robinson: All right. Former Senator John Kerry is now President Biden's Special Envoy for Climate. Let me quote you. This is John Kerry in a 2021 address to the United States, I beg your pardon, to the UN Security Council. John Kerry, 2021 to the UN Security Council, quote, \"Net-zero emissions by 2050 or earlier is the only way that science tells us we can limit this planet's warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Why is that so crucial?\" I'm still quoting Kerry. \"Because overwhelming evidence tells us that anything more will have catastrophic implications. We are marching forward in what is tantamount to a mutual suicide pact.\" Close quote. Overwhelming evidence, science tells us, what's wrong with that?\nSteven Koonin: Well, you should look at the actual science, which I suspect that Ambassador Kerry has not done. You know, the UN puts out every five or six years assessment reports that are the IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change that are meant to survey, assess, and summarize the state of our knowledge about the climate. The most recent one came out about a year ago in 2022. Previous one came out in 2014 or so, and when you read those reports, they're massive. The latest one is 3000 pages and it took 300 scientists a couple years to write. And you really need to be a scientist to understand them. Even as I started to dig into climate science, I got a background in theoretical physics. I can understand this stuff. It took me a couple years to really understand what goes on. Now, ambassador Kerry, other politicians certainly have not done that. But when he's getting his information perhaps from the summary for policy makers in those reports, or more likely for an even further boil down version. And as you boil down the good assessment into the summary, into more condensed versions, there's plenty of room for mischief. And that mischief is evident when you compare what comes out at the end of that game of telephone with what the actual science really is.\nPeter Robinson: All right. Now what we know and what we don't, let's start with what we know. Unsettled, I'm quoting you again Steve. Not everything you've heard about climate science is wrong. In particular, you grant in this book two of the central premises or conclusions of climate science that are in the air that the press is always telling us about. Here's one, and again, I'm gonna quote you.\nSteven Koonin: Sure.\nPeter Robinson: \"We can all agree that the globe has gotten warmer over the last several decades.\" No debunking there needed.\nSteven Koonin: And in fact, it's gotten warmer over the last four centuries.\nPeter Robinson: Okay, now that's a different assertion.\nSteven Koonin: Well, yes, that's cor\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Such shifts can be natural, due to changes in the sun\u2019s activity or large volcanic eruptions. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.\nBurning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun\u2019s heat and raising temperatures.\nThe main greenhouse gases that are causing climate change include carbon dioxide and methane. These come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example. Clearing land and cutting down forests can also release carbon dioxide. Agriculture, oil and gas operations are major sources of methane emissions. Energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main sectors causing greenhouse gases.\nClimate scientists have showed that humans are responsible for virtually all global heating over the last 200 years. Human activities like the ones mentioned above are causing greenhouse gases that are warming the world faster than at any time in at least the last two thousand years.\nThe average temperature of the Earth\u2019s surface is now about 1.42\u00b0C warmer than it was in the late 1800s-prior to the industrial revolution-and warmer than at any time in the last 100,000 years. The last decade (2015-2024) was the warmest on record, and each of the last four decades has been warmer than any previous decade since 1850.\nMany people think that climate change mainly means warmer temperatures. But temperature rise is only the beginning of the story. Because the Earth is a system where everything is connected, changes in one area can influence changes in all others.\nThe consequences of climate change include, among others, intense droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice, catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.\nClimate change can affect our health, ability to grow food, housing, safety and work. Some of us are already more vulnerable to climate impacts, such as people living in small island nations and other developing countries. Conditions like sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion have advanced to the point where entire communities have had to relocate, while protracted droughts are putting people at risk of famine. In the future, the number of people displaced by weather-related events is expected to rise.\nIn a series of UN reports, thousands of scientists and government reviewers agreed that limiting global temperature rise to no more than 1.5\u00b0C would help us avoid the worst climate impacts and maintain a liveable climate. Yet policies currently in place point to up to 2.8\u00b0C of warming by the end of the century.\nThe emissions that cause climate change come from every part of the world and affect everyone, but some countries produce much more than others. The six biggest emitters (China, the United States of America, India, the European Union, the Russian Federation, and Indonesia) together account for more than half of all global greenhouse gas emissions. By contrast, the 45 least developed countries contribute only 3 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.\nEveryone must take climate action, but people and countries creating more of the problem have a greater responsibility to act first.\nMany climate change solutions can deliver economic benefits while improving our lives and protecting the environment. We also have global frameworks and agreements to guide progress, such as the Sustainable Development Goals, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. Three broad categories of action are: cutting emissions, adapting to climate impacts and financing required adjustments.\nSwitching energy systems from fossil fuels to renewables like solar or wind will reduce the emissions driving climate change. But we have to act now. While a growing number of countries is committing to net zero emissions by 2050, emissions must be cut in half by 2030 to keep warming below 1.5\u00b0C. Achieving this means huge declines in the use of coal, oil and gas: production and consumption of all fossil fuels need to be cut by at least 30 per cent by 2030 in order to prevent catastrophic levels of climate change.\nAdapting to climate consequences protects people, homes, businesses, livelihoods, infrastructure and natural ecosystems. It covers current impacts and those likely in the future. Adaptation will be required everywhere but must be prioritized now for the most vulnerable people with the fewest resources to cope with climate hazards. The rate of return can be high. Early warning systems for disasters, for instance, save lives and property, and can deliver benefits up to 10 times the initial cost.\nClimate action requires significant financial investments by governments and businesses. But climate inaction is vastly more expensive. One critical step is for developed countries to support developing countries so they can adapt and move towards greener economies.\nTo get familiar with some of the more technical terms used in connection with climate change, consult the Climate Dictionary.\nClimate change is a hot topic \u2013 with myths and falsehoods circulating widely.

SF6 is very persistent, with an atmospheric lifetime of more than a thousand years.\n\nFull Page Content:\nKey Takeaway: The amount of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere has increased sharply in the past 100 years as measured from the ground and from satellites. Since carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, this increase has warmed the planet.\n430ppm\nJune 2025\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) is an important greenhouse gas. Greenhouse gases trap the heat from sunlight, warming the planet. Without any greenhouse gases, Earth would be too cold to support life. But the more greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere, the warmer the planet becomes.\nCarbon dioxide comes from sources such as the burning of fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, and natural gas), wildfires, and volcanic eruptions. The graph shows atmospheric CO2 levels measured by NOAA at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, since 1958. It's important to note that \u201cparts per million\u201d refers to the number of carbon dioxide molecules per million molecules of dry air. The data shown are the latest available, updated monthly.\nThe second animated graph shows CO2 levels from an Antarctic ice core in combination with the observations from Mauna Loa Observatory. This extends the record back through Earth\u2019s last three glacial cycles. The Antarctic ice core measures CO2 levels trapped in tiny air bubbles from the past that were preserved when the ice formed.\nGround-based and satellite measurements have measured a sharp increase in atmospheric CO2 in recent decades. With a more than 50% increase in CO2 since the start of industrial times in the 18th century, scientific measurements have linked this increase primarily to the burning of coal, oil, and gas. This means that CO2 levels are now 150% the value they were at in 1750 \u2014 this is at least 1.5 times greater than the natural increase observed at the end of the last ice age 20,000 years ago, which happened over thousands of years.\nThe animated map below shows the historical changes in global carbon dioxide over time. Note the colors change as the amount of CO2 rises from 365 parts per million (ppm) in 2002 to over 420 ppm in 2022. These measurements from the AIRS instrument come from the mid-troposphere, the layer of Earth's atmosphere that is 8 to 12 kilometers (about 5 to 7 miles) above the ground.\nA closer look at the carbon dioxide measurements at Mauna Loa shows a series of wiggles in the data. Although total CO2 is increasing each year, there is also a short-term cycle visible within the larger trend.\nThis annual rise and fall of CO2 levels is caused by seasonal cycles in photosynthesis on a global scale. In Northern Hemisphere spring, plants come to life and draw in CO2 to fuel their growth. This begins the process of lowering the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. In northern autumn, plant growth stops or slows down, and the whole process reverses itself. Much of the plant matter decomposes, releasing CO2 back to the atmosphere.\nA similar but less intense pattern repeats in the Southern Hemisphere in opposite seasons. Spring growth starts in September and winter decomposition begins in March, so CO2 records in the Southern Hemisphere show the opposite pattern of that seen in Mauna Loa. However, because there is a lot more land and vegetation in the Northern Hemisphere than the southern, the global yearly cycle more closely aligns with the northern seasons.\nSee the cycle in action in the visualization Watching Earth Breathe: The Seasonal Vegetation Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide.\nThis cycle of plant growth gives the graph of CO2 a sawtooth pattern of ups and downs from year to year. At a larger scale, the upward climb of the trend line over the decades is caused by CO2 emissions, primarily from burning fossil fuels. Thus, the data illustrate both natural factors and human additions of CO2.\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

How do we know?\nScientists agree that global warming is caused mainly by human activity. Specifically, the evidence shows that certain heat-trapping gases, such as carbon dioxide, are warming the world\u2014and that we release those gases when we burn fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas.\nAs scientific models and methods grow more sophisticated, and as we collect more data, our confidence in human-caused climate change only grows higher. Here\u2019s what we know.\nClimate science encompasses a range of disciplines, from oceanography and meteorology, to chemistry, physics, biology and computer science.\nGenerally speaking, scientists working on climate change compare the climate patterns they observe with patterns developed using sophisticated models of Earth's systems (such as the atmosphere and ocean). By comparing the observed and modeled patterns, scientists can positively identify \"human fingerprints\u201d and attribute a proportion of observed warming to human activities.\nThese fingerprints are found in a diverse range of records from the atmosphere, the ocean, and Earth\u2019s surface. They include rising levels of carbon dioxide, unprecedented warming, and a distinct atomic signature left behind in the atmosphere when fossil fuels are burned.\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) is the heat-trapping gas in our atmosphere responsible for most of the warming measured over the past several decades. It\u2019s released during cement manufacturing and when coal, gas, and oil are burned\u2014something humans started doing a great deal of during the Industrial Revolution through to today.\nThe concentration of CO2 in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere has increased dramatically over the last 150 years, from a pre-industrial era concentration of approximately 280 parts per million (ppm) to more than 410 ppm currently. CO2 concentration levels are unlikely to dip below these annual averages for hundreds of years.\nIn fact, measurements from ancient ice cores show that CO2 is now at its highest levels in over 800,000 years.\nGet the latest updates on our work to fight climate change and how you can help right from your inbox.\nSIGN UP TODAY\nAs the concentration of CO2 and other heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere rises, the Earth warms up. In fact, Earth has recently undergone unprecedented warming, particularly since the 1950s.\nEvery single year since 1977 has been warmer than the 20th century average. Nineteen of the 20 warmest years have occurred since 2001. The period of 2015 to 2019 included the top five hottest years on record.\nAnalysis of these trends strongly suggests that without the emissions from burning coal and oil, it is very unlikely that 13 out of the 15 warmest years on record would have occurred either on their own or in such quick succession. This also makes sense from the known causes.\nIt is extremely likely that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.\nWe know that CO2 warms the world, that CO2 concentrations are at record-breaking levels, and that global temperatures are rising. But how do we know for certain that humans are the cause?\nThe answer is in the science. The CO2 produced from fossil fuels carries a unique signature that differentiates it from CO2 produced from other sources. In brief, it carries a specific ratio of carbon isotopes that is only found in the atmosphere when coal, oil, or gas is burned.\nScientists call this \u03b413C (pronounced \"delta C thirteen\"), and it\u2019s a smoking gun. Since the 1880s, \u03b413C has changed in a way that could only happen if CO2 was increasingly coming from fossil fuel sources.\nThis information tells scientists that human-caused fossil fuel emissions have been the main contributor to the rise in CO2 concentrations since the pre-industrial era.\nWithin the scientific community, there is essentially no disagreement on the causes of climate change. Multiple studies have shown that at least 97 percent of scientists agree that global warming is happening and that human activity is the primary cause.\nMajor scientific assessments also agree. The 2018 US National Climate Assessment\u2014whose authors include 300 leading scientists and thirteen federal government agencies\u2014concludes that \u201cit is extremely likely that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. For the warming over the last century, there is no convincing alternative explanation supported by the extent of the observational evidence.\u201d\nSimilarly, an authoritative 2014 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, written and reviewed by hundreds of climate experts and scientists from countries around the world, states unambiguously: \u201cHuman influence on the climate system is clear, and recent anthropogenic emissions of green-house gases are the highest in history. [\u2026] Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia.\u201d\nWe know that warming and cooling have happened in the past, long before humans were around. Natural \u201cclimate drivers\u201d include the energy from the sun; aerosols from periodic volcanic eruptions, dust, and salt spray; natural ecological phenomena like methane-emitting termite mounds and CO2 uptake by plants; and variations in snow and ice cover that change how much the Earth\u2019s surface reflects the sun\u2019s energy back into space (referred to as albedo).\nAll of these factors have profoundly shaped the Earth\u2019s climate. However, none of them sufficiently explain the recent, dramatic increase in global temperatures. For that, scientists need to include human influences.\nWhen natural and human-induced climate drivers are compared to one another, the human influences are so large that they crowd out other climate drivers over the past half century, producing the warming that we\u2019re all ex\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

In this wide-ranging discussion, based in part on his 2021 book, Unsettled: What Climate Science Tells Us, What It Doesn't, and Why It Matters, Koonin gives a more refined look at the science behind the climate issue than the media typically offers, guiding us through the evidence and its implications. As Koonin explains in this interview, he was \u201cshaken by the realization that climate science was far less mature than I had supposed\u201d and that the \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d of catastrophic implications of anthropogenic global warming wasn\u2019t so overwhelming after all.\nTo view the full transcript of this episode, read below:\nPeter Robinson: A scientist who's skeptical about climate science, or at least about a lot of what passes for climate science, which would of course make him another crackpot conservative, or not. He served as under Secretary of the Department of Energy in the Obama administration, Stephen Koonin, on Uncommon Knowledge now. Welcome to Uncommon Knowledge. I'm Peter Robinson. Now, a professor at New York University and a fellow at the Hoover Institution, Steven Koonin received a Bachelor of science degree at Caltech and a doctorate in physics at MIT. During a career in which he published more than 200 peer reviewed scientific papers and a textbook on computational physics, Dr. Koonin rose to become Provost of Caltech. In 2009, president Obama appointed him under Secretary of Science at the Department of Energy, a position Dr. Koonin held for some two and a half years, during which he found himself shocked by the misuse of climate science in politics and the press. In 2021, Dr. Koonin published Unsettled, What Climate Science Tells Us, What It Doesn't, and Why it Matters. Steven Koonin, welcome.\nSteven Koonin: Wonderful to be talking with you Peter.\nPeter Robinson: The shaken secretary, in Unsettled you write of a 2014 workshop for the American Physical Society, which means it's you and a bunch of other people who I cannot even begin to follow, serious professional scientists in which you and several colleagues were asked to subject current climate science to a stress test, to push it, to prod it, to test it, to see how good it was. From Unsettled and I'm quoting you now Steve. \"I'm a scientist. I work to understand the world through measurements and observations. I came away from the workshop not only surprised, but shaken by the realization that climate science was far less mature than I had supposed.\" Close quote. Well, let's start with the end of that. What had you supposed?\nSteven Koonin: Well, I had supposed that humans were warming the globe. Carbon dioxide was accumulating in the atmosphere causing all kinds of trouble, melting ice caps, warming oceans, and so on. And the data didn't support a lot of that. And the projections of what would happen in the future relied on models that were, let's say, shaky at best.\nPeter Robinson: All right. Former Senator John Kerry is now President Biden's Special Envoy for Climate. Let me quote you. This is John Kerry in a 2021 address to the United States, I beg your pardon, to the UN Security Council. John Kerry, 2021 to the UN Security Council, quote, \"Net-zero emissions by 2050 or earlier is the only way that science tells us we can limit this planet's warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Why is that so crucial?\" I'm still quoting Kerry. \"Because overwhelming evidence tells us that anything more will have catastrophic implications. We are marching forward in what is tantamount to a mutual suicide pact.\" Close quote. Overwhelming evidence, science tells us, what's wrong with that?\nSteven Koonin: Well, you should look at the actual science, which I suspect that Ambassador Kerry has not done. You know, the UN puts out every five or six years assessment reports that are the IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change that are meant to survey, assess, and summarize the state of our knowledge about the climate. The most recent one came out about a year ago in 2022. Previous one came out in 2014 or so, and when you read those reports, they're massive. The latest one is 3000 pages and it took 300 scientists a couple years to write. And you really need to be a scientist to understand them. Even as I started to dig into climate science, I got a background in theoretical physics. I can understand this stuff. It took me a couple years to really understand what goes on. Now, ambassador Kerry, other politicians certainly have not done that. But when he's getting his information perhaps from the summary for policy makers in those reports, or more likely for an even further boil down version. And as you boil down the good assessment into the summary, into more condensed versions, there's plenty of room for mischief. And that mischief is evident when you compare what comes out at the end of that game of telephone with what the actual science really is.\nPeter Robinson: All right. Now what we know and what we don't, let's start with what we know. Unsettled, I'm quoting you again Steve. Not everything you've heard about climate science is wrong. In particular, you grant in this book two of the central premises or conclusions of climate science that are in the air that the press is always telling us about. Here's one, and again, I'm gonna quote you.\nSteven Koonin: Sure.\nPeter Robinson: \"We can all agree that the globe has gotten warmer over the last several decades.\" No debunking there needed.\nSteven Koonin: And in fact, it's gotten warmer over the last four centuries.\nPeter Robinson: Okay, now that's a different assertion.\nSteven Koonin: Well, yes, that's cor\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Since carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, this increase has warmed the planet.\n430ppm\nJune 2025\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) is an important greenhouse gas. Greenhouse gases trap the heat from sunlight, warming the planet. Without any greenhouse gases, Earth would be too cold to support life. But the more greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere, the warmer the planet becomes.\nCarbon dioxide comes from sources such as the burning of fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, and natural gas), wildfires, and volcanic eruptions. The graph shows atmospheric CO2 levels measured by NOAA at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, since 1958. It's important to note that \u201cparts per million\u201d refers to the number of carbon dioxide molecules per million molecules of dry air. The data shown are the latest available, updated monthly.\nThe second animated graph shows CO2 levels from an Antarctic ice core in combination with the observations from Mauna Loa Observatory. This extends the record back through Earth\u2019s last three glacial cycles. The Antarctic ice core measures CO2 levels trapped in tiny air bubbles from the past that were preserved when the ice formed.\nGround-based and satellite measurements have measured a sharp increase in atmospheric CO2 in recent decades. With a more than 50% increase in CO2 since the start of industrial times in the 18th century, scientific measurements have linked this increase primarily to the burning of coal, oil, and gas. This means that CO2 levels are now 150% the value they were at in 1750 \u2014 this is at least 1.5 times greater than the natural increase observed at the end of the last ice age 20,000 years ago, which happened over thousands of years.\nThe animated map below shows the historical changes in global carbon dioxide over time. Note the colors change as the amount of CO2 rises from 365 parts per million (ppm) in 2002 to over 420 ppm in 2022. These measurements from the AIRS instrument come from the mid-troposphere, the layer of Earth's atmosphere that is 8 to 12 kilometers (about 5 to 7 miles) above the ground.\nA closer look at the carbon dioxide measurements at Mauna Loa shows a series of wiggles in the data. Although total CO2 is increasing each year, there is also a short-term cycle visible within the larger trend.\nThis annual rise and fall of CO2 levels is caused by seasonal cycles in photosynthesis on a global scale. In Northern Hemisphere spring, plants come to life and draw in CO2 to fuel their growth. This begins the process of lowering the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. In northern autumn, plant growth stops or slows down, and the whole process reverses itself. Much of the plant matter decomposes, releasing CO2 back to the atmosphere.\nA similar but less intense pattern repeats in the Southern Hemisphere in opposite seasons. Spring growth starts in September and winter decomposition begins in March, so CO2 records in the Southern Hemisphere show the opposite pattern of that seen in Mauna Loa. However, because there is a lot more land and vegetation in the Northern Hemisphere than the southern, the global yearly cycle more closely aligns with the northern seasons.\nSee the cycle in action in the visualization Watching Earth Breathe: The Seasonal Vegetation Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide.\nThis cycle of plant growth gives the graph of CO2 a sawtooth pattern of ups and downs from year to year. At a larger scale, the upward climb of the trend line over the decades is caused by CO2 emissions, primarily from burning fossil fuels. Thus, the data illustrate both natural factors and human additions of CO2.\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

We find statistically significant agreement between the two estimates and the late 20th century hurricane frequency is within the range seen over the past millennium. Numerical simulations using a hurricane-permitting climate model suggest that hurricane activity was likely driven by endogenous climate variability and linked to anomalous SSTs of warm Atlantic and cold Pacific. Volcanic eruptions can induce peaks in hurricane activity, but such peaks would likely be too weak to be detected in the proxy record due to large endogenous variability.\nSubject terms: Palaeoclimate, Climate and Earth system modelling\nThe authors present two independent reconstructions and a model simulations of Atlantic hurricane activity over the last millennium and show that it is mainly driven by internal climate variability instead of external forcings.\nTropical cyclones (TCs), which are often referred to as hurricanes in the North Atlantic basin, are among the most destructive extreme weather systems. Hurricanes often bring damaging surges along coastal areas, heavy rainfall, and intense surface winds to both coastal and inland regions, all of which can lead to economic loss, fatalities, and suffering1\u20133. It is, therefore, of practical importance to understand the climatic drivers of hurricane variability and the response to climate change.\nObservations of past hurricane activity changes and their relation to climate drivers can help us better understand the climate-hurricane connection. Unfortunately, we only have a short period of reliable hurricane observations (mostly over the satellite era: 1970s\u2013present), making it difficult to constrain and validate current climate models. As such, confident detection of hurricane frequency changes and attribution to anthropogenic climate change over recent decades is not yet possible4\u20138, and the projected response of hurricanes to a future warming world is highly dependent on climate models or estimation methods6,9,10.\nAlthough instrumental records only extend back to the mid-19th century11,12, one can obtain evidence of earlier hurricane activity from paleohurricane archives. For example, sediment cores collected from coastal basins preserve coarse-grained sediment layers deposited by proximal passing hurricanes13\u201320. These reconstructions document how hurricane frequency has changed over the past several thousand years. Unfortunately, these proxies are site-specific and typically only record storms that pass within a certain radius of the site and that exceed a certain intensity threshold. In order to reconstruct regional or basin-scale activity, paleohurricane records must be compiled21, and we are aware of only one previous study that has compiled multiple paleohurricane sediment records into a basin-wide hurricane estimate22. The paleohurricane proxy network has been substantially enhanced since then (2009) by efforts to increase the density and geographic coverage of sites20 and also by producing new high-resolution records from coastal karst basins23\u201328. It is not yet clear whether or how these advances in paleotempestological archives improve the skill in reconstructing basin-wide Atlantic hurricane frequency.\nHere, we use the most updated network of high-resolution and well-dated sediment-based paleohurricane records23\u201326,29 (Fig. 1A, B) to produce a basin-scale estimate of North Atlantic TC frequency for the last millennium. Our estimate combines twelve regional sediment estimates spanning sites from the Caribbean Sea, the US Gulf Coast, and the US East Coast. We require that all proxies included in the compilation spanned at least 1000 years with multi-decadal resolution or higher.

In this wide-ranging discussion, based in part on his 2021 book, Unsettled: What Climate Science Tells Us, What It Doesn't, and Why It Matters, Koonin gives a more refined look at the science behind the climate issue than the media typically offers, guiding us through the evidence and its implications. As Koonin explains in this interview, he was \u201cshaken by the realization that climate science was far less mature than I had supposed\u201d and that the \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d of catastrophic implications of anthropogenic global warming wasn\u2019t so overwhelming after all.\nTo view the full transcript of this episode, read below:\nPeter Robinson: A scientist who's skeptical about climate science, or at least about a lot of what passes for climate science, which would of course make him another crackpot conservative, or not. He served as under Secretary of the Department of Energy in the Obama administration, Stephen Koonin, on Uncommon Knowledge now. Welcome to Uncommon Knowledge. I'm Peter Robinson. Now, a professor at New York University and a fellow at the Hoover Institution, Steven Koonin received a Bachelor of science degree at Caltech and a doctorate in physics at MIT. During a career in which he published more than 200 peer reviewed scientific papers and a textbook on computational physics, Dr. Koonin rose to become Provost of Caltech. In 2009, president Obama appointed him under Secretary of Science at the Department of Energy, a position Dr. Koonin held for some two and a half years, during which he found himself shocked by the misuse of climate science in politics and the press. In 2021, Dr. Koonin published Unsettled, What Climate Science Tells Us, What It Doesn't, and Why it Matters. Steven Koonin, welcome.\nSteven Koonin: Wonderful to be talking with you Peter.\nPeter Robinson: The shaken secretary, in Unsettled you write of a 2014 workshop for the American Physical Society, which means it's you and a bunch of other people who I cannot even begin to follow, serious professional scientists in which you and several colleagues were asked to subject current climate science to a stress test, to push it, to prod it, to test it, to see how good it was. From Unsettled and I'm quoting you now Steve. \"I'm a scientist. I work to understand the world through measurements and observations. I came away from the workshop not only surprised, but shaken by the realization that climate science was far less mature than I had supposed.\" Close quote. Well, let's start with the end of that. What had you supposed?\nSteven Koonin: Well, I had supposed that humans were warming the globe. Carbon dioxide was accumulating in the atmosphere causing all kinds of trouble, melting ice caps, warming oceans, and so on. And the data didn't support a lot of that. And the projections of what would happen in the future relied on models that were, let's say, shaky at best.\nPeter Robinson: All right. Former Senator John Kerry is now President Biden's Special Envoy for Climate. Let me quote you. This is John Kerry in a 2021 address to the United States, I beg your pardon, to the UN Security Council. John Kerry, 2021 to the UN Security Council, quote, \"Net-zero emissions by 2050 or earlier is the only way that science tells us we can limit this planet's warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Why is that so crucial?\" I'm still quoting Kerry. \"Because overwhelming evidence tells us that anything more will have catastrophic implications. We are marching forward in what is tantamount to a mutual suicide pact.\" Close quote. Overwhelming evidence, science tells us, what's wrong with that?\nSteven Koonin: Well, you should look at the actual science, which I suspect that Ambassador Kerry has not done. You know, the UN puts out every five or six years assessment reports that are the IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change that are meant to survey, assess, and summarize the state of our knowledge about the climate. The most recent one came out about a year ago in 2022. Previous one came out in 2014 or so, and when you read those reports, they're massive. The latest one is 3000 pages and it took 300 scientists a couple years to write. And you really need to be a scientist to understand them. Even as I started to dig into climate science, I got a background in theoretical physics. I can understand this stuff. It took me a couple years to really understand what goes on. Now, ambassador Kerry, other politicians certainly have not done that. But when he's getting his information perhaps from the summary for policy makers in those reports, or more likely for an even further boil down version. And as you boil down the good assessment into the summary, into more condensed versions, there's plenty of room for mischief. And that mischief is evident when you compare what comes out at the end of that game of telephone with what the actual science really is.\nPeter Robinson: All right. Now what we know and what we don't, let's start with what we know. Unsettled, I'm quoting you again Steve. Not everything you've heard about climate science is wrong. In particular, you grant in this book two of the central premises or conclusions of climate science that are in the air that the press is always telling us about. Here's one, and again, I'm gonna quote you.\nSteven Koonin: Sure.\nPeter Robinson: \"We can all agree that the globe has gotten warmer over the last several decades.\" No debunking there needed.\nSteven Koonin: And in fact, it's gotten warmer over the last four centuries.\nPeter Robinson: Okay, now that's a different assertion.\nSteven Koonin: Well, yes, that's cor\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This paper has three goals. First, it provides background on the climate crisis, the role of human behavior in creating this crisis, and the health impacts of climate change. Second, it proposes a multilevel, translational approach to investigating health behavior change in the context of the climate crisis. Third, it identifies specific challenges and opportunities for increasing the rigor of behavioral medicine research in the context of the climate crisis. The paper closes with a call for behavioral medicine to be responsive to the climate crisis.\nKeywords: Behavioral medicine, Climate change, Global warming, Anthropocene, Mitigation, Adaptation, Health co-benefits\nClimate change is transforming the planet and, consequently, exacerbating threats to human health. This paper offers a framework for remaking behavioral medicine research to address climate change and its impacts.\nPractice: Instilling a sense of connection, promoting empathy, and developing a vision for humankind as interdependent must be a priority if we are to foster the kinds of behaviors\u2014individually and collectively\u2014that will promote planetary health.\nPolicy: Ultimately, the goals of our work as behavioral medicine researchers, practitioners, and policy makers, in response to the crises resulting from climate change, must be to redefine individual health and health behaviors as part of planetary health, with a priority on identifying how to motivate individuals to see themselves as part of humankind and take collective action.\nResearch: Priorities for a behavioral medicine research agenda include (1) promoting behavior changes to facilitate planetary health, (2) identifying and developing behavioral interventions at multiple levels\u2014from the individual to systems-level\u2014to facilitate climate-resilient health behaviors, and (3) preparing ourselves and our patients for future shocks to physical, social, and health systems that will feel uncanny and alien.\nThe climate crisis (and its attendant mass extinctions and ecological breakdown) is the most complex and consequential challenge humans have ever faced [1]. For the past 10,000 years, Earth has experienced an incredibly stable temperature, which yielded predictable seasons, favorable conditions for agriculture and complex social systems, and enough consistency in the frequency and intensity of \u201cnatural\u201d threats to allow for reliable infrastructure development. Because nature was predictable, we were able to develop technologies, cities, economies, and other markers of civilization that allowed many of us to ignore it. That period, because it was so odd in geographical terms, was given a name: the Holocene. We had long assumed that this stability was the only and natural state of Earth\u2019s systems, but we now know that burning fossil fuels for energy has caused many of Earth\u2019s systems to change radically [2\u20135].\nWe now live in the Anthropocene, an era of hotter temperatures and more variable weather conditions (as well as other human-caused changes to natural systems) that threaten human lives and the continuity of human civilizations. The past 7 years were the hottest ever recorded globally, and we are unlikely to enjoy such cool conditions again, because most or all of the years in the next decade will continue to shatter record high temperatures [6]. Indeed, paleoclimatologists have consulted the geologic record for past eras that could serve as analogs for Earth\u2019s near-future state, and found that, by the 2030s, the mid-Pliocene (3.3\u20133 million years ago) was the closest match [7]. The mid-Pliocene era is the most recent period with atmospheric CO2 comparable with the present (ca. 400 ppm), with mean annual surface temperatures approximately 1.8\u00b0C\u20133.6\u00b0C warmer than preindustrial temperatures (i.e., 1,850\u20131,900), reduced ice sheet extents, and increased sea levels. Just as pre-Holocene Earth was inhospitable to human life, we now face accelerating risk of a rapid, irreversible return to a state of extreme instability and unpredictability across many Earth systems simultaneously [8]. Although every living species has an ancestor that survived the mid-Pliocene, past global warming/cooling took place over millennia. No species has faced the unprecedented speed at which anthropogenic warming is occurring [9]. Scientific estimates of the year in which mean local climate conditions will fall outside of the range to which its human infrastructure and plants/animals have adapted (e.g., mean annual temperature exceed the highest previously observed temperature for the area, and do not return) fall between 2036 (for tropical regions with very low prior variance) and 2080 (for more variable areas, under optimistic emissions scenarios), with a global (optimistic emissions) date of 2069 [4].\nThe popular term for the thresholds in Earth\u2019s dynamic climate and ecological systems, past which rapid, consequential changes would make them inhospitable to humans, is \u201ctipping points\u201d [10]. These tipping points are terrifying, because they signify shifts from the current, steadily worsening conditions according to well understood causal associations between human activity and environmental consequence, to nonlinear (runaway, cascading) changes of unknown speed and upper bound. Such changes could be locked in, and represent a transformative shift from a state in which human activity functions as a crucial protector of human civilization to one in which such activity instead contributes to destabilizing the planetary conditions on which we depend.\nThe first and most pressing example of human contributors to destabilizing the Earth systems that sustain our civilizations is global heating. Currently, the defining feature of modern civilizations is that they require massive energy use to maintain the unprecedented productivity and annual growt\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Volcanic eruptions can induce peaks in hurricane activity, but such peaks would likely be too weak to be detected in the proxy record due to large endogenous variability.\nSubject terms: Palaeoclimate, Climate and Earth system modelling\nThe authors present two independent reconstructions and a model simulations of Atlantic hurricane activity over the last millennium and show that it is mainly driven by internal climate variability instead of external forcings.\nTropical cyclones (TCs), which are often referred to as hurricanes in the North Atlantic basin, are among the most destructive extreme weather systems. Hurricanes often bring damaging surges along coastal areas, heavy rainfall, and intense surface winds to both coastal and inland regions, all of which can lead to economic loss, fatalities, and suffering1\u20133. It is, therefore, of practical importance to understand the climatic drivers of hurricane variability and the response to climate change.\nObservations of past hurricane activity changes and their relation to climate drivers can help us better understand the climate-hurricane connection. Unfortunately, we only have a short period of reliable hurricane observations (mostly over the satellite era: 1970s\u2013present), making it difficult to constrain and validate current climate models. As such, confident detection of hurricane frequency changes and attribution to anthropogenic climate change over recent decades is not yet possible4\u20138, and the projected response of hurricanes to a future warming world is highly dependent on climate models or estimation methods6,9,10.\nAlthough instrumental records only extend back to the mid-19th century11,12, one can obtain evidence of earlier hurricane activity from paleohurricane archives. For example, sediment cores collected from coastal basins preserve coarse-grained sediment layers deposited by proximal passing hurricanes13\u201320. These reconstructions document how hurricane frequency has changed over the past several thousand years. Unfortunately, these proxies are site-specific and typically only record storms that pass within a certain radius of the site and that exceed a certain intensity threshold. In order to reconstruct regional or basin-scale activity, paleohurricane records must be compiled21, and we are aware of only one previous study that has compiled multiple paleohurricane sediment records into a basin-wide hurricane estimate22. The paleohurricane proxy network has been substantially enhanced since then (2009) by efforts to increase the density and geographic coverage of sites20 and also by producing new high-resolution records from coastal karst basins23\u201328. It is not yet clear whether or how these advances in paleotempestological archives improve the skill in reconstructing basin-wide Atlantic hurricane frequency.\nHere, we use the most updated network of high-resolution and well-dated sediment-based paleohurricane records23\u201326,29 (Fig. 1A, B) to produce a basin-scale estimate of North Atlantic TC frequency for the last millennium. Our estimate combines twelve regional sediment estimates spanning sites from the Caribbean Sea, the US Gulf Coast, and the US East Coast. We require that all proxies included in the compilation spanned at least 1000 years with multi-decadal resolution or higher. All records needed published criteria for storm event layers and machine-readable information about each record\u2019s age model. We compare this sediment proxy-based estimate to an independent SST-based statistical model for hurricane frequency11 produced using last millennium reanalysis (LMR) SSTs30,31. Our null hypothesis is that this SST-emulated hurricane frequency estimate is not correlated with the sediment proxy-based reconstruction. If this null hypothesis can be rejected, it is more likely that the two independent estimates of hurricane activity in the last millennium capture a cohesive signal that is representative of climate modulation.\nA Map of locations for all the sites contributing to the paleo-hurricane sedimentary archives.

A and B share the same color map to represent different sites. Shadings indicate a 95% confidence interval. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.\nGiven the lack of a trend in hurricane frequency from the middle 19th century to the present day12,32, we also hypothesize that internal climate variability primarily drives hurricane variability over the last millennium. We test this hypothesis by investigating a millennium-long control simulation from the hurricane-permitting high-resolution climate mode\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Greenland's shrinking ice sheet also speeds up global warming. The vast expanse of snow and ice helps cool down Earth by reflecting the Sun's rays back into space.

But, thanks to improved early warnings and disaster management, the number of deaths decreased almost three-fold.\nAccording to the WMO Atlas of Mortality and Economic Losses from Weather, Climate and Water Extremes (1970 \u2013 2019), there were more than 11 000 reported disasters attributed to these hazards globally, with just over 2 million deaths and US$ 3.64 trillion in losses.\nThe report is the most comprehensive review of mortality and economic losses from weather, water and climate extremes to date. It assesses the entire 50-year period as well as by individual decade.\nFrom 1970 to 2019, weather, climate and water hazards accounted for 50% of all disasters, 45% of all reported deaths and 74% of all reported economic losses.\nMore than 91% of these deaths occurred in developing countries (using the United Nations Country Classification).\nOf the top 10 disasters, the hazards that led to the largest human losses during the period have been droughts (650 000 deaths), storms (577 232 deaths), floods (58 700 deaths) and extreme temperature (55 736 deaths).\nDeaths decreased almost threefold from 1970 to 2019. Death tolls fell from over 50 000 deaths in the 1970s to less than 20 000 in the 2010s. The 1970s and 1980s reported an average of 170 related deaths per day. In the 1990s, that average fell by one third to 90 related deaths per day, then continued to fall in the 2010s to 40 related deaths per day.\nWith regard to economic losses, the top 10 events include storms (US$ 521 billion) and floods (US$ 115 billion).\nDuring the 50-year period, US$ 202 million dollars in damage occurred on average every day. Economic losses have increased sevenfold from the 1970s to the 2010s. The reported losses from 2010\u20132019 (US$ 383 million per day on average over the decade) were seven times the amount reported from 1970\u20131979 (US$ 49 million). Storms were the most prevalent cause of damage, resulting in the largest economic losses around the globe. It is the sole hazard for which the attributed portion is continually increasing.\nThree of the costliest 10 disasters occurred in 2017: Hurricanes Harvey (US$ 96.9 billion), Maria (US$ 69.4 billion) and Irma (US$ 58.2 billion). These three hurricanes alone accounted for 35% of the total economic losses of the top 10 disasters around the world from 1970 to 2019.\n\u201cThe number of weather, climate and water extremes are increasing and will become more frequent and severe in many parts of the world as a result of climate change,\u201d says WMO Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas.\n\u201cThat means more heatwaves, drought and forest fires such as those we have observed recently in Europe and North America. We have more water vapor in the atmosphere, which is exacerbating extreme rainfall and deadly flooding. The warming of the oceans has affected the frequency and area of existence of the most intense tropical storms,\u201d he comments.\n\u201cEconomic losses are mounting as exposure increases. But, behind the stark statistics, lies a message of hope. Improved multi-hazard early warning systems have led to a significant reduction in mortality. Quite simply, we are better than ever before at saving lives,\u201d according to Prof. Taalas.\nBut much more remains to be done. Only half of the 193 members of WMO have multi-hazard early warning systems and there are severe gaps in weather and hydrological observing networks in Africa, some parts of Latin America and in Pacific and Caribbean island states.\nWMO is strengthening collaboration with its partners to address risks associated with weather, climate and water extremes. The UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, which moves into WMO headquarters in Geneva on 1 September, and the World Health Organization contributed to the WMO Atlas.\n\u201cMore lives are being saved thanks to early warning systems but it is also true that the number of people exposed to disaster risk is increasing due t\u00e5o population growth in hazard-exposed areas and the growing intensity and frequency of weather events. More international cooperation is needed to tackle the chronic problem of huge numbers of people being displaced each year by floods, storms and drought. We need greater investment in comprehensive disaster risk management ensuring that climate change adaptation is integrated in national and local disaster risk reduction strategies,\u201d said Mami Mizutori, Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction and Head of UNDRR.\n\u201cThe overlap of the COVID-19 pandemic with many other natural and manmade hazards, especially extreme weather events during the last 18 months demonstrates the need for greater investment in disaster risk reduction and a multi-hazard approach to disaster risk management and early warning systems to reduce risks and strengthen preparedness for multiple disaster scenarios,\u201d she said.\nTo highlight impacts of specific weather, climate and water hazards, the report disaggregates the data to the disaster subtype and sub-subtype and provides a regional breakdown. This is intended to inform policy development and decision-making to protect lives and livelihoods and to strengthen standards in loss accounting and related disaster databases.\nStatistics in the WMO Atlas are from the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) maintained by the Centre for Research on the Epid\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Antarctica and Greenland continue to lose ice today, and that rate of loss has accelerated since the first IMBIE study.\nIMBIE is supported by the NASA Earth Science Division and the ESA Climate Change Initiative.\nTo learn more about NASA missions studying climate change, visit:\nhttps://climate.nasa.gov\nTo learn more about NASA's study of sea level rise, visit:\nhttps://sealevel.nasa.gov\nView the latest sea level data in Earth Now:\nhttps://go.nasa.gov/341j5aV\nArielle Samuelson Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. 818-354-0307 arielle.a.samuelson@jpl.nasa.gov\nSite Manager: Carmen Blackwood NASA Responsible Official: Doug Newman\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

But, thanks to improved early warnings and disaster management, the number of deaths decreased almost three-fold.\nAccording to the WMO Atlas of Mortality and Economic Losses from Weather, Climate and Water Extremes (1970 \u2013 2019), there were more than 11 000 reported disasters attributed to these hazards globally, with just over 2 million deaths and US$ 3.64 trillion in losses.\nThe report is the most comprehensive review of mortality and economic losses from weather, water and climate extremes to date. It assesses the entire 50-year period as well as by individual decade.\nFrom 1970 to 2019, weather, climate and water hazards accounted for 50% of all disasters, 45% of all reported deaths and 74% of all reported economic losses.\nMore than 91% of these deaths occurred in developing countries (using the United Nations Country Classification).\nOf the top 10 disasters, the hazards that led to the largest human losses during the period have been droughts (650 000 deaths), storms (577 232 deaths), floods (58 700 deaths) and extreme temperature (55 736 deaths).\nDeaths decreased almost threefold from 1970 to 2019. Death tolls fell from over 50 000 deaths in the 1970s to less than 20 000 in the 2010s. The 1970s and 1980s reported an average of 170 related deaths per day. In the 1990s, that average fell by one third to 90 related deaths per day, then continued to fall in the 2010s to 40 related deaths per day.\nWith regard to economic losses, the top 10 events include storms (US$ 521 billion) and floods (US$ 115 billion).\nDuring the 50-year period, US$ 202 million dollars in damage occurred on average every day. Economic losses have increased sevenfold from the 1970s to the 2010s. The reported losses from 2010\u20132019 (US$ 383 million per day on average over the decade) were seven times the amount reported from 1970\u20131979 (US$ 49 million). Storms were the most prevalent cause of damage, resulting in the largest economic losses around the globe. It is the sole hazard for which the attributed portion is continually increasing.\nThree of the costliest 10 disasters occurred in 2017: Hurricanes Harvey (US$ 96.9 billion), Maria (US$ 69.4 billion) and Irma (US$ 58.2 billion). These three hurricanes alone accounted for 35% of the total economic losses of the top 10 disasters around the world from 1970 to 2019.\n\u201cThe number of weather, climate and water extremes are increasing and will become more frequent and severe in many parts of the world as a result of climate change,\u201d says WMO Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas.\n\u201cThat means more heatwaves, drought and forest fires such as those we have observed recently in Europe and North America. We have more water vapor in the atmosphere, which is exacerbating extreme rainfall and deadly flooding. The warming of the oceans has affected the frequency and area of existence of the most intense tropical storms,\u201d he comments.\n\u201cEconomic losses are mounting as exposure increases. But, behind the stark statistics, lies a message of hope. Improved multi-hazard early warning systems have led to a significant reduction in mortality. Quite simply, we are better than ever before at saving lives,\u201d according to Prof. Taalas.\nBut much more remains to be done. Only half of the 193 members of WMO have multi-hazard early warning systems and there are severe gaps in weather and hydrological observing networks in Africa, some parts of Latin America and in Pacific and Caribbean island states.\nWMO is strengthening collaboration with its partners to address risks associated with weather, climate and water extremes. The UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, which moves into WMO headquarters in Geneva on 1 September, and the World Health Organization contributed to the WMO Atlas.\n\u201cMore lives are being saved thanks to early warning systems but it is also true that the number of people exposed to disaster risk is increasing due t\u00e5o population growth in hazard-exposed areas and the growing intensity and frequency of weather events. More international cooperation is needed to tackle the chronic problem of huge numbers of people being displaced each year by floods, storms and drought. We need greater investment in comprehensive disaster risk management ensuring that climate change adaptation is integrated in national and local disaster risk reduction strategies,\u201d said Mami Mizutori, Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction and Head of UNDRR.\n\u201cThe overlap of the COVID-19 pandemic with many other natural and manmade hazards, especially extreme weather events during the last 18 months demonstrates the need for greater investment in disaster risk reduction and a multi-hazard approach to disaster risk management and early warning systems to reduce risks and strengthen preparedness for multiple disaster scenarios,\u201d she said.\nTo highlight impacts of specific weather, climate and water hazards, the report disaggregates the data to the disaster subtype and sub-subtype and provides a regional breakdown. This is intended to inform policy development and decision-making to protect lives and livelihoods and to strengthen standards in loss accounting and related disaster databases.\nStatistics in the WMO Atlas are from the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) maintained by the Centre for Research on the Epid\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

It is one of three main greenhouse gases in the atmosphere of Earth. The concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere reached 427 ppm (0.0427%) on a molar basis in 2024, representing 3341 gigatonnes of CO2.[1] This is an increase of 50% since the start of the Industrial Revolution, up from 280 ppm during the 10,000 years prior to the mid-18th century.[2][3][4] The increase is due to human activity.[5]\nThe current increase in CO2 concentrations is primarily driven by the burning of fossil fuels.[6] Other significant human activities that emit CO2 include cement production, deforestation, and biomass burning. The increase in atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases such as methane increase the absorption and emission of infrared radiation by the atmosphere. This has led to a rise in average global temperature and ocean acidification. Another direct effect is the CO2 fertilization effect. The increase in atmospheric concentrations of CO2 causes a range of further effects of climate change on the environment and human living conditions.\nCarbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. It absorbs and emits infrared radiation at its two infrared-active vibrational frequencies. The two wavelengths are 4.26 \u03bcm (2,347 cm\u22121) (antisymmetric stretching vibrational mode) and 14.99 \u03bcm (667 cm\u22121) (bending vibrational mode). CO2 plays a significant role in influencing Earth's surface temperature through the greenhouse effect.[7] Light emission from the Earth's surface is most intense in the infrared region between 200 and 2500 cm\u22121,[8] as opposed to light emission from the much hotter Sun which is most intense in the visible region. Absorption of infrared light at the vibrational frequencies of atmospheric CO2 traps energy near the surface, warming the surface of Earth and its lower atmosphere. Less energy reaches the upper atmosphere, which is therefore cooler because of this absorption.[9]\nThe present atmospheric concentration of CO2 is the highest for 14 million years.[10] Concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere were as high as 4,000 ppm during the Cambrian period about 500 million years ago, and as low as 180 ppm during the Quaternary glaciation of the last two million years.[2] Reconstructed temperature records for the last 420 million years indicate that atmospheric CO2 concentrations peaked at approximately 2,000 ppm. This peak happened during the Devonian period (400 million years ago). Another peak occurred in the Triassic period (220\u2013200 million years ago).[11]\nSince the start of the Industrial Revolution, atmospheric CO2 concentration has been increasing, causing global warming and ocean acidification.[12] In October 2023 the average level of CO2 in Earth's atmosphere, adjusted for seasonal variation, was 422.17 parts per million by volume (ppm).[13] Figures are published monthly by the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).[14][15] The value had been about 280 ppm during the 10,000 years up to the mid-18th century.[2][3][4]\nEach part per million of CO2 in the atmosphere represents approximately 2.13 gigatonnes of carbon, or 7.82 gigatonnes of CO2.[16]\nIt was pointed out in 2021 that \"the current rates of increase of the concentration of the major greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide) are unprecedented over at least the last 800,000 years\".[17]: 515\nAs of 2024, it is estimated that 2,650 gigatonnes of CO2 have been emitted by human activity since 1850, with annual emissions of 42 gigatonnes per year. About 1,050 gigatonnes remain in the atmosphere following absorption by oceans and land.[18]\nSome fraction (a projected 20\u201335%) of the fossil carbon transferred thus far will persist in the atmosphere as elevated CO2 levels for many thousands of years after these carbon transfer activities begin to subside.[19][20]\nAtmospheric CO2 concentrations fluctuate slightly with the seasons, falling during the Northern Hemisphere spring and summer as plants consume the gas and rising during northern autumn and winter as plants go dormant or die and decay. The level drops by about 6 or 7 ppm (about 50 Gt) from May to September during the Northern Hemisphere's growing season, and then goes up by about 8 or 9 ppm. The Northern Hemisphere dominates the annual cycle of CO2 concentration because it has much greater land area and plant biomass in mid-latitudes (30-60 degrees) than the Southern Hemisphere. Concentrations reach a peak in May as the Northern Hemisphere spring greenup begins, and decline to a minimum in October, near the end of the growing season.[21][22]\nConcentrations also vary on a regional basis, most strongly near the ground with much smaller variations aloft. In urban areas concentrations are generally higher[23] and indoors they can reach 10 times background levels.\nThe concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are expressed as parts per million by volume (abbreviated as ppmv, or ppm(v), or just ppm). To convert from the usual ppmv units to ppm mass (abbreviated as ppmm, or ppm(m)), multiply by the ratio of the molar mass of CO2 to that of air, i.e. times 1.52 (44.01 divided by 28.96).\nThe first reproducibly accurate measurements of atmospheric CO2 were from flask sample measurements made by Dave Keeling at Caltech in the 1950s.[32] Measurements at Mauna Loa have been ongoing since 1958. Additionally, measurements are also made at many other sites around the world. Many measurement sites are part of larger global networks. Global network data are often made publicly available.\nThere are several surface measurement (including flasks and continuous in situ) networks including NOAA/ERSL,[33] WDCGG,[34] and RAMCES.[35] The NOAA/ESRL Baseline Observatory Network, and the Scripps Institution of O\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Absorption of infrared light at the vibrational frequencies of atmospheric CO2 traps energy near the surface, warming the surface of Earth and its lower atmosphere. Less energy reaches the upper atmosphere, which is therefore cooler because of this absorption.[9]\nThe present atmospheric concentration of CO2 is the highest for 14 million years.[10] Concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere were as high as 4,000 ppm during the Cambrian period about 500 million years ago, and as low as 180 ppm during the Quaternary glaciation of the last two million years.[2] Reconstructed temperature records for the last 420 million years indicate that atmospheric CO2 concentrations peaked at approximately 2,000 ppm. This peak happened during the Devonian period (400 million years ago). Another peak occurred in the Triassic period (220\u2013200 million years ago).[11]\nSince the start of the Industrial Revolution, atmospheric CO2 concentration has been increasing, causing global warming and ocean acidification.[12] In October 2023 the average level of CO2 in Earth's atmosphere, adjusted for seasonal variation, was 422.17 parts per million by volume (ppm).[13] Figures are published monthly by the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).[14][15] The value had been about 280 ppm during the 10,000 years up to the mid-18th century.[2][3][4]\nEach part per million of CO2 in the atmosphere represents approximately 2.13 gigatonnes of carbon, or 7.82 gigatonnes of CO2.[16]\nIt was pointed out in 2021 that \"the current rates of increase of the concentration of the major greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide) are unprecedented over at least the last 800,000 years\".[17]: 515\nAs of 2024, it is estimated that 2,650 gigatonnes of CO2 have been emitted by human activity since 1850, with annual emissions of 42 gigatonnes per year. About 1,050 gigatonnes remain in the atmosphere following absorption by oceans and land.[18]\nSome fraction (a projected 20\u201335%) of the fossil carbon transferred thus far will persist in the atmosphere as elevated CO2 levels for many thousands of years after these carbon transfer activities begin to subside.[19][20]\nAtmospheric CO2 concentrations fluctuate slightly with the seasons, falling during the Northern Hemisphere spring and summer as plants consume the gas and rising during northern autumn and winter as plants go dormant or die and decay. The level drops by about 6 or 7 ppm (about 50 Gt) from May to September during the Northern Hemisphere's growing season, and then goes up by about 8 or 9 ppm. The Northern Hemisphere dominates the annual cycle of CO2 concentration because it has much greater land area and plant biomass in mid-latitudes (30-60 degrees) than the Southern Hemisphere. Concentrations reach a peak in May as the Northern Hemisphere spring greenup begins, and decline to a minimum in October, near the end of the growing season.[21][22]\nConcentrations also vary on a regional basis, most strongly near the ground with much smaller variations aloft.

It is one of three main greenhouse gases in the atmosphere of Earth. The concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere reached 427 ppm (0.0427%) on a molar basis in 2024, representing 3341 gigatonnes of CO2.[1] This is an increase of 50% since the start of the Industrial Revolution, up from 280 ppm during the 10,000 years prior to the mid-18th century.[2][3][4] The increase is due to human activity.[5]\nThe current increase in CO2 concentrations is primarily driven by the burning of fossil fuels.[6] Other significant human activities that emit CO2 include cement production, deforestation, and biomass burning. The increase in atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases such as methane increase the absorption and emission of infrared radiation by the atmosphere. This has led to a rise in average global temperature and ocean acidification. Another direct effect is the CO2 fertilization effect. The increase in atmospheric concentrations of CO2 causes a range of further effects of climate change on the environment and human living conditions.\nCarbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. It absorbs and emits infrared radiation at its two infrared-active vibrational frequencies. The two wavelengths are 4.26 \u03bcm (2,347 cm\u22121) (antisymmetric stretching vibrational mode) and 14.99 \u03bcm (667 cm\u22121) (bending vibrational mode).

Since carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, this increase has warmed the planet.\n430ppm\nJune 2025\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) is an important greenhouse gas. Greenhouse gases trap the heat from sunlight, warming the planet. Without any greenhouse gases, Earth would be too cold to support life. But the more greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere, the warmer the planet becomes.\nCarbon dioxide comes from sources such as the burning of fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, and natural gas), wildfires, and volcanic eruptions. The graph shows atmospheric CO2 levels measured by NOAA at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, since 1958. It's important to note that \u201cparts per million\u201d refers to the number of carbon dioxide molecules per million molecules of dry air. The data shown are the latest available, updated monthly.\nThe second animated graph shows CO2 levels from an Antarctic ice core in combination with the observations from Mauna Loa Observatory. This extends the record back through Earth\u2019s last three glacial cycles. The Antarctic ice core measures CO2 levels trapped in tiny air bubbles from the past that were preserved when the ice formed.\nGround-based and satellite measurements have measured a sharp increase in atmospheric CO2 in recent decades. With a more than 50% increase in CO2 since the start of industrial times in the 18th century, scientific measurements have linked this increase primarily to the burning of coal, oil, and gas. This means that CO2 levels are now 150% the value they were at in 1750 \u2014 this is at least 1.5 times greater than the natural increase observed at the end of the last ice age 20,000 years ago, which happened over thousands of years.\nThe animated map below shows the historical changes in global carbon dioxide over time. Note the colors change as the amount of CO2 rises from 365 parts per million (ppm) in 2002 to over 420 ppm in 2022. These measurements from the AIRS instrument come from the mid-troposphere, the layer of Earth's atmosphere that is 8 to 12 kilometers (about 5 to 7 miles) above the ground.\nA closer look at the carbon dioxide measurements at Mauna Loa shows a series of wiggles in the data. Although total CO2 is increasing each year, there is also a short-term cycle visible within the larger trend.\nThis annual rise and fall of CO2 levels is caused by seasonal cycles in photosynthesis on a global scale. In Northern Hemisphere spring, plants come to life and draw in CO2 to fuel their growth. This begins the process of lowering the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. In northern autumn, plant growth stops or slows down, and the whole process reverses itself. Much of the plant matter decomposes, releasing CO2 back to the atmosphere.\nA similar but less intense pattern repeats in the Southern Hemisphere in opposite seasons. Spring growth starts in September and winter decomposition begins in March, so CO2 records in the Southern Hemisphere show the opposite pattern of that seen in Mauna Loa. However, because there is a lot more land and vegetation in the Northern Hemisphere than the southern, the global yearly cycle more closely aligns with the northern seasons.\nSee the cycle in action in the visualization Watching Earth Breathe: The Seasonal Vegetation Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide.\nThis cycle of plant growth gives the graph of CO2 a sawtooth pattern of ups and downs from year to year. At a larger scale, the upward climb of the trend line over the decades is caused by CO2 emissions, primarily from burning fossil fuels. Thus, the data illustrate both natural factors and human additions of CO2.\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

But, thanks to improved early warnings and disaster management, the number of deaths decreased almost three-fold.\nAccording to the WMO Atlas of Mortality and Economic Losses from Weather, Climate and Water Extremes (1970 \u2013 2019), there were more than 11 000 reported disasters attributed to these hazards globally, with just over 2 million deaths and US$ 3.64 trillion in losses.\nThe report is the most comprehensive review of mortality and economic losses from weather, water and climate extremes to date. It assesses the entire 50-year period as well as by individual decade.\nFrom 1970 to 2019, weather, climate and water hazards accounted for 50% of all disasters, 45% of all reported deaths and 74% of all reported economic losses.\nMore than 91% of these deaths occurred in developing countries (using the United Nations Country Classification).\nOf the top 10 disasters, the hazards that led to the largest human losses during the period have been droughts (650 000 deaths), storms (577 232 deaths), floods (58 700 deaths) and extreme temperature (55 736 deaths).\nDeaths decreased almost threefold from 1970 to 2019. Death tolls fell from over 50 000 deaths in the 1970s to less than 20 000 in the 2010s. The 1970s and 1980s reported an average of 170 related deaths per day. In the 1990s, that average fell by one third to 90 related deaths per day, then continued to fall in the 2010s to 40 related deaths per day.\nWith regard to economic losses, the top 10 events include storms (US$ 521 billion) and floods (US$ 115 billion).\nDuring the 50-year period, US$ 202 million dollars in damage occurred on average every day. Economic losses have increased sevenfold from the 1970s to the 2010s. The reported losses from 2010\u20132019 (US$ 383 million per day on average over the decade) were seven times the amount reported from 1970\u20131979 (US$ 49 million). Storms were the most prevalent cause of damage, resulting in the largest economic losses around the globe. It is the sole hazard for which the attributed portion is continually increasing.\nThree of the costliest 10 disasters occurred in 2017: Hurricanes Harvey (US$ 96.9 billion), Maria (US$ 69.4 billion) and Irma (US$ 58.2 billion). These three hurricanes alone accounted for 35% of the total economic losses of the top 10 disasters around the world from 1970 to 2019.\n\u201cThe number of weather, climate and water extremes are increasing and will become more frequent and severe in many parts of the world as a result of climate change,\u201d says WMO Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas.\n\u201cThat means more heatwaves, drought and forest fires such as those we have observed recently in Europe and North America. We have more water vapor in the atmosphere, which is exacerbating extreme rainfall and deadly flooding. The warming of the oceans has affected the frequency and area of existence of the most intense tropical storms,\u201d he comments.\n\u201cEconomic losses are mounting as exposure increases. But, behind the stark statistics, lies a message of hope. Improved multi-hazard early warning systems have led to a significant reduction in mortality. Quite simply, we are better than ever before at saving lives,\u201d according to Prof. Taalas.\nBut much more remains to be done. Only half of the 193 members of WMO have multi-hazard early warning systems and there are severe gaps in weather and hydrological observing networks in Africa, some parts of Latin America and in Pacific and Caribbean island states.\nWMO is strengthening collaboration with its partners to address risks associated with weather, climate and water extremes. The UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, which moves into WMO headquarters in Geneva on 1 September, and the World Health Organization contributed to the WMO Atlas.\n\u201cMore lives are being saved thanks to early warning systems but it is also true that the number of people exposed to disaster risk is increasing due t\u00e5o population growth in hazard-exposed areas and the growing intensity and frequency of weather events. More international cooperation is needed to tackle the chronic problem of huge numbers of people being displaced each year by floods, storms and drought. We need greater investment in comprehensive disaster risk management ensuring that climate change adaptation is integrated in national and local disaster risk reduction strategies,\u201d said Mami Mizutori, Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction and Head of UNDRR.\n\u201cThe overlap of the COVID-19 pandemic with many other natural and manmade hazards, especially extreme weather events during the last 18 months demonstrates the need for greater investment in disaster risk reduction and a multi-hazard approach to disaster risk management and early warning systems to reduce risks and strengthen preparedness for multiple disaster scenarios,\u201d she said.\nTo highlight impacts of specific weather, climate and water hazards, the report disaggregates the data to the disaster subtype and sub-subtype and provides a regional breakdown. This is intended to inform policy development and decision-making to protect lives and livelihoods and to strengthen standards in loss accounting and related disaster databases.\nStatistics in the WMO Atlas are from the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) maintained by the Centre for Research on the Epid\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

As the ice melts into the ocean, it raises the sea level around the world, causing flooding and other damage to coastal communities. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech \u203a Larger view\nThe Greenland Ice Sheet is rapidly melting, having lost 3.8 trillion tons of ice between 1992 and 2018, a new study from NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) finds. The study combined 26 independent satellite datasets to track global warming's effect on Greenland, one of the largest ice sheets on Earth, and the ice sheet melt's impact on rising sea levels. The findings, which forecast an approximate 3 to 5 inches (70 to 130 millimeters) of global sea level rise by 2100, are in alignment with previous worst-case projections if the average rate of Greenland's ice loss continues.\nChanges to the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are of considerable societal importance, as they directly impact global sea levels, which are a result of climate change. As glaciers and ice sheets melt, they add more water to the ocean. Increasing rates of global warming have accelerated Greenland's ice mass loss from 25 billion tons per year in the 1990s to a current average of 234 billion tons per year. This means that Greenland's ice is melting on average seven times faster today than it was at the beginning of the study period. The Greenland Ice Sheet holds enough water to raise the sea level by 24 feet (7.4 meters).\nThe paper, published Dec. 10 in Nature, is the result of an international collaboration between 89 polar scientists from 50 scientific institutions supported by NASA and ESA. The Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise, or IMBIE, used well-calibrated data from 13 NASA and ESA satellite missions to create the most accurate measurements of ice loss to date. The team found that half of the loss is tied to surface ice melting in warmer air. The rest of the loss is the result of factors such as warmer ocean temperatures, iceberg calving and the ice sheet shedding ice into the ocean more quickly.\n\"There are climate projections that are based on models of varying levels of complexity and observations, but they have large uncertainties. Our study is purely an observational one that tests those uncertainties. Therefore, we have irrefutable evidence that we seem to be on track with one of the most pessimistic sea level rise scenarios,\" said Erik Ivins, second author and lead scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.\nGreenland is home to the only permanent ice sheet outside Antarctica. The sheet covers three-fourths of Greenland's land mass. But in the last 26 years, Greenland's melting ice has added 0.4 inches (11 millimeters) to sea level rise. Its cumulative 3.8 trillion tons of melted ice is equivalent to adding the water from 120 million Olympic-size swimming pools to the ocean every year, for 26 years.\n\"As a rule of thumb, for every centimeter rise in global sea level, another 6 million people are exposed to coastal flooding around the planet,\" said Andrew Shepherd, lead author and scientist from the University of Leeds in the United Kingdom. \"On current trends, Greenland ice melting will cause 100 million people to be flooded each year by the end of the century, so 400 million in total due to sea level rise.\"\nIn addition to storm surges and high tides that will increase flooding in many regions, sea level rise exacerbates events like hurricanes. Greenland's shrinking ice sheet also speeds up global warming. The vast expanse of snow and ice helps cool down Earth by reflecting the Sun's rays back into space. As the ice melts and retreats, the region absorbs more solar radiation, which warms the planet.\nThe new study will contribute to the evaluation and evolution of sea level rise models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in evaluating risks to current and future populations. The results of the study currently appear consistent with the panel's worst-case projections for sea level rise in the next 80 years.\n\"The full set of consequences of future melt from the Greenland Ice Sheet remain uncertain, but even a small increase in sea level can have devastating effects on ports and coastal zones, cause destructive erosion, wetland flooding, and aquifer and agricultural soil contamination with salt,\" said Ivins.\nThis is the third IMBIE study on ice loss as a result of global warming. IMBIE's first report in 2012 measured both Greenland and Antarctica's shrinking ice sheets, finding that the combined ice losses from Antarctica and Greenland had increased over time and that the ice sheets were losing three times as much ice as they were in the early 1990s. Antarctica and Greenland continue to lose ice today, and that rate of loss has accelerated since the first IMBIE study.\nIMBIE is supported by the NASA Earth Science Division and the ESA Climate Change Initiative.\nTo learn more about NASA missions studying climate change, visit:\nhttps://climate.nasa.gov\nTo learn more about NASA's study of sea level rise, visit:\nhttps://sealevel.nasa.gov\nView the latest sea level data in Earth Now:\nhttps://go.nasa.gov/341j5aV\nArielle Samuelson Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. 818-354-0307 arielle.a.samuelson@jpl.nasa.gov\nSite Manager: Carmen Blackwood NASA Responsible Official: Doug Newman\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

As the ice melts into the ocean, it raises the sea level around the world, causing flooding and other damage to coastal communities. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech \u203a Larger view\nThe Greenland Ice Sheet is rapidly melting, having lost 3.8 trillion tons of ice between 1992 and 2018, a new study from NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) finds. The study combined 26 independent satellite datasets to track global warming's effect on Greenland, one of the largest ice sheets on Earth, and the ice sheet melt's impact on rising sea levels. The findings, which forecast an approximate 3 to 5 inches (70 to 130 millimeters) of global sea level rise by 2100, are in alignment with previous worst-case projections if the average rate of Greenland's ice loss continues.\nChanges to the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are of considerable societal importance, as they directly impact global sea levels, which are a result of climate change. As glaciers and ice sheets melt, they add more water to the ocean. Increasing rates of global warming have accelerated Greenland's ice mass loss from 25 billion tons per year in the 1990s to a current average of 234 billion tons per year. This means that Greenland's ice is melting on average seven times faster today than it was at the beginning of the study period. The Greenland Ice Sheet holds enough water to raise the sea level by 24 feet (7.4 meters).\nThe paper, published Dec. 10 in Nature, is the result of an international collaboration between 89 polar scientists from 50 scientific institutions supported by NASA and ESA. The Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise, or IMBIE, used well-calibrated data from 13 NASA and ESA satellite missions to create the most accurate measurements of ice loss to date. The team found that half of the loss is tied to surface ice melting in warmer air. The rest of the loss is the result of factors such as warmer ocean temperatures, iceberg calving and the ice sheet shedding ice into the ocean more quickly.\n\"There are climate projections that are based on models of varying levels of complexity and observations, but they have large uncertainties. Our study is purely an observational one that tests those uncertainties. Therefore, we have irrefutable evidence that we seem to be on track with one of the most pessimistic sea level rise scenarios,\" said Erik Ivins, second author and lead scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.\nGreenland is home to the only permanent ice sheet outside Antarctica. The sheet covers three-fourths of Greenland's land mass. But in the last 26 years, Greenland's melting ice has added 0.4 inches (11 millimeters) to sea level rise. Its cumulative 3.8 trillion tons of melted ice is equivalent to adding the water from 120 million Olympic-size swimming pools to the ocean every year, for 26 years.\n\"As a rule of thumb, for every centimeter rise in global sea level, another 6 million people are exposed to coastal flooding around the planet,\" said Andrew Shepherd, lead author and scientist from the University of Leeds in the United Kingdom. \"On current trends, Greenland ice melting will cause 100 million people to be flooded each year by the end of the century, so 400 million in total due to sea level rise.\"\nIn addition to storm surges and high tides that will increase flooding in many regions, sea level rise exacerbates events like hurricanes. Greenland's shrinking ice sheet also speeds up global warming. The vast expanse of snow and ice helps cool down Earth by reflecting the Sun's rays back into space. As the ice melts and retreats, the region absorbs more solar radiation, which warms the planet.\nThe new study will contribute to the evaluation and evolution of sea level rise models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in evaluating risks to current and future populations. The results of the study currently appear consistent with the panel's worst-case projections for sea level rise in the next 80 years.\n\"The full set of consequences of future melt from the Greenland Ice Sheet remain uncertain, but even a small increase in sea level can have devastating effects on ports and coastal zones, cause destructive erosion, wetland flooding, and aquifer and agricultural soil contamination with salt,\" said Ivins.\nThis is the third IMBIE study on ice loss as a result of global warming. IMBIE's first report in 2012 measured both Greenland and Antarctica's shrinking ice sheets, finding that the combined ice losses from Antarctica and Greenland had increased over time and that the ice sheets were losing three times as much ice as they were in the early 1990s. Antarctica and Greenland continue to lose ice today, and that rate of loss has accelerated since the first IMBIE study.\nIMBIE is supported by the NASA Earth Science Division and the ESA Climate Change Initiative.\nTo learn more about NASA missions studying climate change, visit:\nhttps://climate.nasa.gov\nTo learn more about NASA's study of sea level rise, visit:\nhttps://sealevel.nasa.gov\nView the latest sea level data in Earth Now:\nhttps://go.nasa.gov/341j5aV\nArielle Samuelson Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. 818-354-0307 arielle.a.samuelson@jpl.nasa.gov\nSite Manager: Carmen Blackwood NASA Responsible Official: Doug Newman\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Here we extend the record to the last millennium using two independent estimates: a reconstruction from sedimentary paleohurricane records and a statistical model of hurricane activity using sea surface temperatures (SSTs). We find statistically significant agreement between the two estimates and the late 20th century hurricane frequency is within the range seen over the past millennium. Numerical simulations using a hurricane-permitting climate model suggest that hurricane activity was likely driven by endogenous climate variability and linked to anomalous SSTs of warm Atlantic and cold Pacific. Volcanic eruptions can induce peaks in hurricane activity, but such peaks would likely be too weak to be detected in the proxy record due to large endogenous variability.\nSubject terms: Palaeoclimate, Climate and Earth system modelling\nThe authors present two independent reconstructions and a model simulations of Atlantic hurricane activity over the last millennium and show that it is mainly driven by internal climate variability instead of external forcings.\nTropical cyclones (TCs), which are often referred to as hurricanes in the North Atlantic basin, are among the most destructive extreme weather systems. Hurricanes often bring damaging surges along coastal areas, heavy rainfall, and intense surface winds to both coastal and inland regions, all of which can lead to economic loss, fatalities, and suffering1\u20133. It is, therefore, of practical importance to understand the climatic drivers of hurricane variability and the response to climate change.\nObservations of past hurricane activity changes and their relation to climate drivers can help us better understand the climate-hurricane connection. Unfortunately, we only have a short period of reliable hurricane observations (mostly over the satellite era: 1970s\u2013present), making it difficult to constrain and validate current climate models. As such, confident detection of hurricane frequency changes and attribution to anthropogenic climate change over recent decades is not yet possible4\u20138, and the projected response of hurricanes to a future warming world is highly dependent on climate models or estimation methods6,9,10.\nAlthough instrumental records only extend back to the mid-19th century11,12, one can obtain evidence of earlier hurricane activity from paleohurricane archives. For example, sediment cores collected from coastal basins preserve coarse-grained sediment layers deposited by proximal passing hurricanes13\u201320. These reconstructions document how hurricane frequency has changed over the past several thousand years. Unfortunately, these proxies are site-specific and typically only record storms that pass within a certain radius of the site and that exceed a certain intensity threshold. In order to reconstruct regional or basin-scale activity, paleohurricane records must be compiled21, and we are aware of only one previous study that has compiled multiple paleohurricane sediment records into a basin-wide hurricane estimate22. The paleohurricane proxy network has been substantially enhanced since then (2009) by efforts to increase the density and geographic coverage of sites20 and also by producing new high-resolution records from coastal karst basins23\u201328. It is not yet clear whether or how these advances in paleotempestological archives improve the skill in reconstructing basin-wide Atlantic hurricane frequency.\nHere, we use the most updated network of high-resolution and well-dated sediment-based paleohurricane records23\u201326,29 (Fig. 1A, B) to produce a basin-scale estimate of North Atlantic TC frequency for the last millennium. Our estimate combines twelve regional sediment estimates spanning sites from the Caribbean Sea, the US Gulf Coast, and the US East Coast. We require that all proxies included in the compilation spanned at least 1000 years with multi-decadal resolution or higher. All records needed published criteria for storm event layers and machine-readable information about each record\u2019s age model. We compare this sediment proxy-based estimate to an independent SST-based statistical model for hurricane frequency11 produced using last millennium reanalysis (LMR) SSTs30,31. Our null hypothesis is that this SST-emulated hurricane frequency estimate is not correlated with the sediment proxy-based reconstruction. If this null hypothesis can be rejected, it is more likely that the two independent estimates of hurricane activity in the last millennium capture a cohesive signal that is representative of climate modulation.\nA Map of locations for all the sites contributing to the paleo-hurricane sedimentary archives.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.\nGiven the lack of a trend in hurricane frequency from the middle 19th century to the present day12,32, we also hypothesize that internal climate variability primarily drives hurricane variability over the last millennium. We test this hypothesis by investigating a millennium-long control simulation from the hurricane-permitting high-resolution climate mode\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

But, thanks to improved early warnings and disaster management, the number of deaths decreased almost three-fold.\nAccording to the WMO Atlas of Mortality and Economic Losses from Weather, Climate and Water Extremes (1970 \u2013 2019), there were more than 11 000 reported disasters attributed to these hazards globally, with just over 2 million deaths and US$ 3.64 trillion in losses.\nThe report is the most comprehensive review of mortality and economic losses from weather, water and climate extremes to date. It assesses the entire 50-year period as well as by individual decade.\nFrom 1970 to 2019, weather, climate and water hazards accounted for 50% of all disasters, 45% of all reported deaths and 74% of all reported economic losses.\nMore than 91% of these deaths occurred in developing countries (using the United Nations Country Classification).\nOf the top 10 disasters, the hazards that led to the largest human losses during the period have been droughts (650 000 deaths), storms (577 232 deaths), floods (58 700 deaths) and extreme temperature (55 736 deaths).\nDeaths decreased almost threefold from 1970 to 2019. Death tolls fell from over 50 000 deaths in the 1970s to less than 20 000 in the 2010s. The 1970s and 1980s reported an average of 170 related deaths per day. In the 1990s, that average fell by one third to 90 related deaths per day, then continued to fall in the 2010s to 40 related deaths per day.\nWith regard to economic losses, the top 10 events include storms (US$ 521 billion) and floods (US$ 115 billion).\nDuring the 50-year period, US$ 202 million dollars in damage occurred on average every day. Economic losses have increased sevenfold from the 1970s to the 2010s. The reported losses from 2010\u20132019 (US$ 383 million per day on average over the decade) were seven times the amount reported from 1970\u20131979 (US$ 49 million). Storms were the most prevalent cause of damage, resulting in the largest economic losses around the globe. It is the sole hazard for which the attributed portion is continually increasing.\nThree of the costliest 10 disasters occurred in 2017: Hurricanes Harvey (US$ 96.9 billion), Maria (US$ 69.4 billion) and Irma (US$ 58.2 billion). These three hurricanes alone accounted for 35% of the total economic losses of the top 10 disasters around the world from 1970 to 2019.\n\u201cThe number of weather, climate and water extremes are increasing and will become more frequent and severe in many parts of the world as a result of climate change,\u201d says WMO Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas.\n\u201cThat means more heatwaves, drought and forest fires such as those we have observed recently in Europe and North America. We have more water vapor in the atmosphere, which is exacerbating extreme rainfall and deadly flooding. The warming of the oceans has affected the frequency and area of existence of the most intense tropical storms,\u201d he comments.\n\u201cEconomic losses are mounting as exposure increases. But, behind the stark statistics, lies a message of hope. Improved multi-hazard early warning systems have led to a significant reduction in mortality. Quite simply, we are better than ever before at saving lives,\u201d according to Prof. Taalas.\nBut much more remains to be done. Only half of the 193 members of WMO have multi-hazard early warning systems and there are severe gaps in weather and hydrological observing networks in Africa, some parts of Latin America and in Pacific and Caribbean island states.\nWMO is strengthening collaboration with its partners to address risks associated with weather, climate and water extremes. The UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, which moves into WMO headquarters in Geneva on 1 September, and the World Health Organization contributed to the WMO Atlas.\n\u201cMore lives are being saved thanks to early warning systems but it is also true that the number of people exposed to disaster risk is increasing due t\u00e5o population growth in hazard-exposed areas and the growing intensity and frequency of weather events. More international cooperation is needed to tackle the chronic problem of huge numbers of people being displaced each year by floods, storms and drought. We need greater investment in comprehensive disaster risk management ensuring that climate change adaptation is integrated in national and local disaster risk reduction strategies,\u201d said Mami Mizutori, Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction and Head of UNDRR.\n\u201cThe overlap of the COVID-19 pandemic with many other natural and manmade hazards, especially extreme weather events during the last 18 months demonstrates the need for greater investment in disaster risk reduction and a multi-hazard approach to disaster risk management and early warning systems to reduce risks and strengthen preparedness for multiple disaster scenarios,\u201d she said.\nTo highlight impacts of specific weather, climate and water hazards, the report disaggregates the data to the disaster subtype and sub-subtype and provides a regional breakdown.

One ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nThe Greenland Ice Sheet, seen here in Oct. 2018, is melting at a rapidly accelerating rate because of Earth's warming climate. As the ice melts into the ocean, it raises the sea level around the world, causing flooding and other damage to coastal communities. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech \u203a Larger view\nThe Greenland Ice Sheet is rapidly melting, having lost 3.8 trillion tons of ice between 1992 and 2018, a new study from NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) finds. The study combined 26 independent satellite datasets to track global warming's effect on Greenland, one of the largest ice sheets on Earth, and the ice sheet melt's impact on rising sea levels. The findings, which forecast an approximate 3 to 5 inches (70 to 130 millimeters) of global sea level rise by 2100, are in alignment with previous worst-case projections if the average rate of Greenland's ice loss continues.\nChanges to the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are of considerable societal importance, as they directly impact global sea levels, which are a result of climate change. As glaciers and ice sheets melt, they add more water to the ocean. Increasing rates of global warming have accelerated Greenland's ice mass loss from 25 billion tons per year in the 1990s to a current average of 234 billion tons per year. This means that Greenland's ice is melting on average seven times faster today than it was at the beginning of the study period. The Greenland Ice Sheet holds enough water to raise the sea level by 24 feet (7.4 meters).\nThe paper, published Dec. 10 in Nature, is the result of an international collaboration between 89 polar scientists from 50 scientific institutions supported by NASA and ESA. The Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise, or IMBIE, used well-calibrated data from 13 NASA and ESA satellite missions to create the most accurate measurements of ice loss to date. The team found that half of the loss is tied to surface ice melting in warmer air. The rest of the loss is the result of factors such as warmer ocean temperatures, iceberg calving and the ice sheet shedding ice into the ocean more quickly.\n\"There are climate projections that are based on models of varying levels of complexity and observations, but they have large uncertainties. Our study is purely an observational one that tests those uncertainties. Therefore, we have irrefutable evidence that we seem to be on track with one of the most pessimistic sea level rise scenarios,\" said Erik Ivins, second author and lead scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.\nGreenland is home to the only permanent ice sheet outside Antarctica. The sheet covers three-fourths of Greenland's land mass. But in the last 26 years, Greenland's melting ice has added 0.4 inches (11 millimeters) to sea level rise. Its cumulative 3.8 trillion tons of melted ice is equivalent to adding the water from 120 million Olympic-size swimming pools to the ocean every year, for 26 years.\n\"As a rule of thumb, for every centimeter rise in global sea level, another 6 million people are exposed to coastal flooding around the planet,\" said Andrew Shepherd, lead author and scientist from the University of Leeds in the United Kingdom. \"On current trends, Greenland ice melting will cause 100 million people to be flooded each year by the end of the century, so 400 million in total due to sea level rise.\"\nIn addition to storm surges and high tides that will increase flooding in many regions, sea level rise exacerbates events like hurricanes. Greenland's shrinking ice sheet also speeds up global warming. The vast expanse of snow and ice helps cool down Earth by reflecting the Sun's rays back into space. As the ice melts and retreats, the region absorbs more solar radiation, which warms the planet.\nThe new study will contribute to the evaluation and evolution of sea level rise models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in evaluating risks to current and future populations. The results of the study currently appear consistent with the panel's worst-case projections for sea level rise in the next 80 years.\n\"The full set of consequences of future melt from the Greenland Ice Sheet remain uncertain, but even a small increase in sea level can have devastating effects on ports and coastal zones, cause destructive erosion, wetland flooding, and aquifer and agricultural soil contamination with salt,\" said Ivins.\nThis is the third IMBIE study on ice loss as a result of global warming. IMBIE's first report in 2012 measured both Greenland and Antarctica's shrinking ice sheets, finding that the combined ice losses from Antarctica and Greenland had increased over time and that the ice sheets were losing three times as much ice as they were in the early 1990s. Antarctica and Greenland continue to lose ice today, and that rate of loss has accelerated since the first IMBIE study.\nIMBIE is supported by the NASA Earth Science Division and the ESA Climate Change Initiative.\nTo learn more about NASA missions studying climate change, visit:\nhttps://climate.nasa.gov\nTo learn more about NASA's study of sea level rise, visit:\nhttps://sealevel.nasa.gov\nView the latest sea level data in Earth Now:\nhttps://go.nasa.gov/341j5aV\nArielle Samuelson Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. 818-354-0307 arielle.a.samuelson@jpl.nasa.gov\nSite Manager: Carmen Blackwood NASA Responsible Official: Doug Newman\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Here we extend the record to the last millennium using two independent estimates: a reconstruction from sedimentary paleohurricane records and a statistical model of hurricane activity using sea surface temperatures (SSTs). We find statistically significant agreement between the two estimates and the late 20th century hurricane frequency is within the range seen over the past millennium. Numerical simulations using a hurricane-permitting climate model suggest that hurricane activity was likely driven by endogenous climate variability and linked to anomalous SSTs of warm Atlantic and cold Pacific. Volcanic eruptions can induce peaks in hurricane activity, but such peaks would likely be too weak to be detected in the proxy record due to large endogenous variability.\nSubject terms: Palaeoclimate, Climate and Earth system modelling\nThe authors present two independent reconstructions and a model simulations of Atlantic hurricane activity over the last millennium and show that it is mainly driven by internal climate variability instead of external forcings.\nTropical cyclones (TCs), which are often referred to as hurricanes in the North Atlantic basin, are among the most destructive extreme weather systems. Hurricanes often bring damaging surges along coastal areas, heavy rainfall, and intense surface winds to both coastal and inland regions, all of which can lead to economic loss, fatalities, and suffering1\u20133. It is, therefore, of practical importance to understand the climatic drivers of hurricane variability and the response to climate change.\nObservations of past hurricane activity changes and their relation to climate drivers can help us better understand the climate-hurricane connection. Unfortunately, we only have a short period of reliable hurricane observations (mostly over the satellite era: 1970s\u2013present), making it difficult to constrain and validate current climate models. As such, confident detection of hurricane frequency changes and attribution to anthropogenic climate change over recent decades is not yet possible4\u20138, and the projected response of hurricanes to a future warming world is highly dependent on climate models or estimation methods6,9,10.\nAlthough instrumental records only extend back to the mid-19th century11,12, one can obtain evidence of earlier hurricane activity from paleohurricane archives. For example, sediment cores collected from coastal basins preserve coarse-grained sediment layers deposited by proximal passing hurricanes13\u201320. These reconstructions document how hurricane frequency has changed over the past several thousand years. Unfortunately, these proxies are site-specific and typically only record storms that pass within a certain radius of the site and that exceed a certain intensity threshold. In order to reconstruct regional or basin-scale activity, paleohurricane records must be compiled21, and we are aware of only one previous study that has compiled multiple paleohurricane sediment records into a basin-wide hurricane estimate22. The paleohurricane proxy network has been substantially enhanced since then (2009) by efforts to increase the density and geographic coverage of sites20 and also by producing new high-resolution records from coastal karst basins23\u201328. It is not yet clear whether or how these advances in paleotempestological archives improve the skill in reconstructing basin-wide Atlantic hurricane frequency.\nHere, we use the most updated network of high-resolution and well-dated sediment-based paleohurricane records23\u201326,29 (Fig. 1A, B) to produce a basin-scale estimate of North Atlantic TC frequency for the last millennium. Our estimate combines twelve regional sediment estimates spanning sites from the Caribbean Sea, the US Gulf Coast, and the US East Coast. We require that all proxies included in the compilation spanned at least 1000 years with multi-decadal resolution or higher. All records needed published criteria for storm event layers and machine-readable information about each record\u2019s age model. We compare this sediment proxy-based estimate to an independent SST-based statistical model for hurricane frequency11 produced using last millennium reanalysis (LMR) SSTs30,31. Our null hypothesis is that this SST-emulated hurricane frequency estimate is not correlated with the sediment proxy-based reconstruction. If this null hypothesis can be rejected, it is more likely that the two independent estimates of hurricane activity in the last millennium capture a cohesive signal that is representative of climate modulation.\nA Map of locations for all the sites contributing to the paleo-hurricane sedimentary archives.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.\nGiven the lack of a trend in hurricane frequency from the middle 19th century to the present day12,32, we also hypothesize that internal climate variability primarily drives hurricane variability over the last millennium. We test this hypothesis by investigating a millennium-long control simulation from the hurricane-permitting high-resolution climate mode\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Also there are a lot more people\nAre you certain of that? Or did you instead hear it on the news?\nLet\u2019s look at some data, starting with the 25 hottest days on record in the Northeastern US. Here we see that only 3 (12%) of the 25 hottest days have come in the past 20 years \u2014 the other 22 (88%) hottest days ever recorded were all before 1975. In fact, you can see that record high temperatures are HEAVILY clustered in the 1950s and earlier, and sparse not only over the last 20 years, but over the last 60 years.

It is one of three main greenhouse gases in the atmosphere of Earth. The concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere reached 427 ppm (0.0427%) on a molar basis in 2024, representing 3341 gigatonnes of CO2.[1] This is an increase of 50% since the start of the Industrial Revolution, up from 280 ppm during the 10,000 years prior to the mid-18th century.[2][3][4] The increase is due to human activity.[5]\nThe current increase in CO2 concentrations is primarily driven by the burning of fossil fuels.[6] Other significant human activities that emit CO2 include cement production, deforestation, and biomass burning. The increase in atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases such as methane increase the absorption and emission of infrared radiation by the atmosphere. This has led to a rise in average global temperature and ocean acidification. Another direct effect is the CO2 fertilization effect. The increase in atmospheric concentrations of CO2 causes a range of further effects of climate change on the environment and human living conditions.\nCarbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. It absorbs and emits infrared radiation at its two infrared-active vibrational frequencies. The two wavelengths are 4.26 \u03bcm (2,347 cm\u22121) (antisymmetric stretching vibrational mode) and 14.99 \u03bcm (667 cm\u22121) (bending vibrational mode). CO2 plays a significant role in influencing Earth's surface temperature through the greenhouse effect.[7] Light emission from the Earth's surface is most intense in the infrared region between 200 and 2500 cm\u22121,[8] as opposed to light emission from the much hotter Sun which is most intense in the visible region. Absorption of infrared light at the vibrational frequencies of atmospheric CO2 traps energy near the surface, warming the surface of Earth and its lower atmosphere. Less energy reaches the upper atmosphere, which is therefore cooler because of this absorption.[9]\nThe present atmospheric concentration of CO2 is the highest for 14 million years.[10] Concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere were as high as 4,000 ppm during the Cambrian period about 500 million years ago, and as low as 180 ppm during the Quaternary glaciation of the last two million years.[2] Reconstructed temperature records for the last 420 million years indicate that atmospheric CO2 concentrations peaked at approximately 2,000 ppm. This peak happened during the Devonian period (400 million years ago). Another peak occurred in the Triassic period (220\u2013200 million years ago).[11]\nSince the start of the Industrial Revolution, atmospheric CO2 concentration has been increasing, causing global warming and ocean acidification.[12] In October 2023 the average level of CO2 in Earth's atmosphere, adjusted for seasonal variation, was 422.17 parts per million by volume (ppm).[13] Figures are published monthly by the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).[14][15] The value had been about 280 ppm during the 10,000 years up to the mid-18th century.[2][3][4]\nEach part per million of CO2 in the atmosphere represents approximately 2.13 gigatonnes of carbon, or 7.82 gigatonnes of CO2.[16]\nIt was pointed out in 2021 that \"the current rates of increase of the concentration of the major greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide) are unprecedented over at least the last 800,000 years\".[17]: 515\nAs of 2024, it is estimated that 2,650 gigatonnes of CO2 have been emitted by human activity since 1850, with annual emissions of 42 gigatonnes per year. About 1,050 gigatonnes remain in the atmosphere following absorption by oceans and land.[18]\nSome fraction (a projected 20\u201335%) of the fossil carbon transferred thus far will persist in the atmosphere as elevated CO2 levels for many thousands of years after these carbon transfer activities begin to subside.[19][20]\nAtmospheric CO2 concentrations fluctuate slightly with the seasons, falling during the Northern Hemisphere spring and summer as plants consume the gas and rising during northern autumn and winter as plants go dormant or die and decay. The level drops by about 6 or 7 ppm (about 50 Gt) from May to September during the Northern Hemisphere's growing season, and then goes up by about 8 or 9 ppm. The Northern Hemisphere dominates the annual cycle of CO2 concentration because it has much greater land area and plant biomass in mid-latitudes (30-60 degrees) than the Southern Hemisphere. Concentrations reach a peak in May as the Northern Hemisphere spring greenup begins, and decline to a minimum in October, near the end of the growing season.[21][22]\nConcentrations also vary on a regional basis, most strongly near the ground with much smaller variations aloft. In urban areas concentrations are generally higher[23] and indoors they can reach 10 times background levels.\nThe concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are expressed as parts per million by volume (abbreviated as ppmv, or ppm(v), or just ppm). To convert from the usual ppmv units to ppm mass (abbreviated as ppmm, or ppm(m)), multiply by the ratio of the molar mass of CO2 to that of air, i.e. times 1.52 (44.01 divided by 28.96).\nThe first reproducibly accurate measurements of atmospheric CO2 were from flask sample measurements made by Dave Keeling at Caltech in the 1950s.[32] Measurements at Mauna Loa have been ongoing since 1958. Additionally, measurements are also made at many other sites around the world. Many measurement sites are part of larger global networks. Global network data are often made publicly available.\nThere are several surface measurement (including flasks and continuous in situ) networks including NOAA/ERSL,[33] WDCGG,[34] and RAMCES.[35] The NOAA/ESRL Baseline Observatory Network, and the Scripps Institution of O\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Real hot. Heat waves in the United States surely must be the most visible and impactful sign of human caused climate change, right? Well, actually no. Let\u2019s take a look at what the U.S. National Climate Assessment and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change say about heat waves in the United States. What they say may surprise you.\nBefore proceeding, let me emphasize that human-caused climate change is real and significant. Aggressive policies focused on both adaptation and mitigation make very good sense. So too does being accurate about current scientific understandings. The importance of climate change does not mean that we can ignore scientific integrity \u2014 actually the opposite, it makes it all the more important. So let\u2019s take a close look at recent assessment reports and what they say about U.S. heat waves.\nThe figure below comes out of the most recent U.S. National Climate Assessment (NCA). It shows the frequency (top) and intensity (bottom) of heat waves in the U.S. since 1900. The bottom figure is actually based on a paper that I co-authored in 1999, which serves as the basis for an official indicator of climate change used by the Environmental Protection Agency.\nThere are a few things that jump out from these figures. One is that heat waves of recent decades have not reached levels seen in the 1930s, either in their frequency or intensity. The NCA observed that the IPCC (AR5) concluded that \u201cit is very likely that human influence has contributed to the observed changes in frequency and intensity of temperature extremes on the global scale since the mid-20th century.\u201d But at the same time, the NCA also concluded,\nIn general, however, results for the contiguous United States are not as compelling as for global land areas, in part because detection of changes in U.S. regional temperature extremes is affected by extreme temperature in the 1930s.\nThe more recent IPCC AR6 concurred. The complex figure below (which I consolidated from the even more complex IPCC AR6 Figure 11.4) indicates low confidence (~20%) for the detection of trends in extreme heat and the attribution of those trends to human causes for both central and eastern North America (CNA and ENA). In western North American (WNA) detection is judged likely (>66%) but with medium confidence in attribution.\nThe extreme temperatures of 1930s present a challenge for the detection and attribution of trends in heat waves in the United States. That means that consumers of climate reporting need to have their antennae up when reading about heat waves. It is true that if analysis of data begins in the 1960s, then an increase in heat waves can be shown. However, if the data analyses begins before the 1930s then there is no upwards trend, and a case can even be made for a decline. It is a fertile field for cherry pickers.\nShare\nEven though U.S. heat waves have increased since the 1960s, societal vulnerability has decreased over that time. The figure below presents mortality risk in \u201cextreme heat events\u201d across the U.S. since the 1970s, showing an overall decline. This is good news, because it shows that the climate can become more extreme, but society has significant adaptive capacity.\nMake no mistake, looking to the future, the IPCC projects an increase in heat waves around the world, including in the United States. Here is what the IPCC projects for the future:\nIn summary, it is virtually certain that further increases in the intensity and frequency of hot extremes, and decreases in the intensity and frequency of cold extremes, will occur throughout the 21st century and around the world. It is virtually certain that the number of hot days and hot nights and the length, frequency, and/or intensity of warm spells or heatwaves compared to 1995\u20132014 will increase over most land areas. In most regions, changes in the magnitude of temperature extremes are proportional to global warming levels (high confidence).\nHow bad things get is a function of how quickly mitigation occurs. Achieving net-zero carbon dioxide is thus not about the weather this year or next, but about what happens later this century.\nBut regardless how fast we achieve net-zero carbon dioxide, there is good reason to believe that the societal impacts of extreme heat are manageable, and across different scenarios. For instance, according to the World Health Organization, even with increasing heat waves, mortality does not have to increase. Assuming adaptative responses (like air conditioning), the WHO concludes that future \u201cattributable mortality is zero.\u201d The importance of adaptation to reducing vulnerabilities to extreme heat is a robust finding across the literature.\nThe climate is changing, there is no doubt. In many places around the world the signal of these changes has been observed in the occurrence of heat waves. But the United States is not among those places - not yet.\nBut so what? If climate change is real and responding to it is important, why does it matter if we incorrectly attribute today\u2019s weather to climate change? Maybe such incorrect attribution will be politically useful?\nI can think of two reasons why it matters.\nFirst, our assessment of risk can be skewed. If we think this week\u2019s heat wave is a novel event juiced by climate change, rather than within the bounds of observed variability, then we are fooling ourselves. If electrical grids fail and people die this week, that will mean that we are not even prepared for the present. We need only look back to the 1930s to understand that we are also not prepared for the past, much less a more extreme future. Casual claims of detection and attribution can mislead.\nSecond, sustained support for action on climate will require also sustaining public and policy maker trust in science and scientific institutions. Claims that go well beyond scientific understandings place that trust at risk. A scientific consensus doesn\u2019t exist only when it is politically useful \u2014 it also exists when it is political\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

    "input_prompt": "Claim:\nHeat waves in the US are no more common than they were in 1900.\n\nArticle Title:\nU.S.: annual heat wave index 1895-2020 - Statista\n\nGoogle Search Snippet:\nBased on the United States historical record, extended periods of very high temperatures were more frequent in the 1930s.\n\nFull Page Content:\nIt\u2019s hot. Real hot. Heat waves in the United States surely must be the most visible and impactful sign of human caused climate change, right? Well, actually no. Let\u2019s take a look at what the U.S. National Climate Assessment and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change say about heat waves in the United States. What they say may surprise you.\nBefore proceeding, let me emphasize that human-caused climate change is real and significant. Aggressive policies focused on both adaptation and mitigation make very good sense. So too does being accurate about current scientific understandings. The importance of climate change does not mean that we can ignore scientific integrity \u2014 actually the opposite, it makes it all the more important. So let\u2019s take a close look at recent assessment reports and what they say about U.S. heat waves.\nThe figure below comes out of the most recent U.S. National Climate Assessment (NCA). It shows the frequency (top) and intensity (bottom) of heat waves in the U.S. since 1900. The bottom figure is actually based on a paper that I co-authored in 1999, which serves as the basis for an official indicator of climate change used by the Environmental Protection Agency.\nThere are a few things that jump out from these figures. One is that heat waves of recent decades have not reached levels seen in the 1930s, either in their frequency or intensity. The NCA observed that the IPCC (AR5) concluded that \u201cit is very likely that human influence has contributed to the observed changes in frequency and intensity of temperature extremes on the global scale since the mid-20th century.\u201d But at the same time, the NCA also concluded,\nIn general, however, results for the contiguous United States are not as compelling as for global land areas, in part because detection of changes in U.S. regional temperature extremes is affected by extreme temperature in the 1930s.\nThe more recent IPCC AR6 concurred. The complex figure below (which I consolidated from the even more complex IPCC AR6 Figure 11.4) indicates low confidence (~20%) for the detection of trends in extreme heat and the attribution of those trends to human causes for both central and eastern North America (CNA and ENA). In western North American (WNA) detection is judged likely (>66%) but with medium confidence in attribution.\nThe extreme temperatures of 1930s present a challenge for the detection and attribution of trends in heat waves in the United States. That means that consumers of climate reporting need to have their antennae up when reading about heat waves. It is true that if analysis of data begins in the 1960s, then an increase in heat waves can be shown. However, if the data analyses begins before the 1930s then there is no upwards trend, and a case can even be made for a decline. It is a fertile field for cherry pickers.\nShare\nEven though U.S. heat waves have increased since the 1960s, societal vulnerability has decreased over that time. The figure below presents mortality risk in \u201cextreme heat events\u201d across the U.S. since the 1970s, showing an overall decline. This is good news, because it shows that the climate can become more extreme, but society has significant adaptive capacity.\nMake no mistake, looking to the future, the IPCC projects an increase in heat waves around the world, including in the United States. Here is what the IPCC projects for the future:\nIn summary, it is virtually certain that further increases in the intensity and frequency of hot extremes, and decreases in the intensity and frequency of cold extremes, will occur throughout the 21st century and around the world. It is virtually certain that the number of hot days and hot nights and the length, frequency, and/or intensity of warm spells or heatwaves compared to 1995\u20132014 will increase over most land areas. In most regions, changes in the magnitude of temperature extremes are proportional to global warming levels (high confidence).\nHow bad things get is a function of how quickly mitigation occurs. Achieving net-zero carbon dioxide is thus not about the weather this year or next, but about what happens later this century.\nBut regardless how fast we achieve net-zero carbon dioxide, there is good reason to believe that the societal impacts of extreme heat are manageable, and across different scenarios. For instance, according to the World Health Organization, even with increasing heat waves, mortality does not have to increase. Assuming adaptative responses (like air conditioning), the WHO concludes that future \u201cattributable mortality is zero.\u201d The importance of adaptation to reducing vulnerabilities to extreme heat is a robust finding across the literature.\nThe climate is changing, there is no doubt. In many places around the world the signal of these changes has been observed in the occurrence of heat waves. But the United States is not among those places - not yet.\nBut so what? If climate change is real and responding to it is important, why does it matter if we incorrectly attribute today\u2019s weather to climate change? Maybe such incorrect attribution will be politically useful?\nI can think of two reasons why it matters.\nFirst, our assessment of risk can be skewed. If we think this week\u2019s heat wave is a novel event juiced by climate change, rather than within the bounds of observed variability, then we are fooling ourselves. If electrical grids fail and people die this week, that will mean that we are not even prepared for the present. We need only look back to the 1930s to understand that we are also not prepared for the past, much less a more extreme future. Casual claims of detection and attribution can mislead.\nSecond, sustained support for action on climate will require also sustaining public and policy maker trust in science and scientific institutions. Claims that go well beyond scientific understandings place that trust at risk. A scientific consensus doesn\u2019t exist only when it is politically useful \u2014 it also exists when it is political\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",
