    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nWhat if I told you there was something that you can do right now that would have an immediate, positive benefit for your brain including your mood and your focus? And what if I told you that same thing could actually last a long time and protect your brain from different conditions like depression, Alzheimer's disease or dementia. Would you do it? Yes! I am talking about the powerful effects of physical activity. Simply moving your body, has immediate, long-lasting and protective benefits for your brain. And that can last for the rest of your life. So what I want to do today is tell you a story about how I used my deep understanding of neuroscience, as a professor of neuroscience, to essentially do an experiment on myself in which I discovered the science underlying why exercise is the most transformative thing that you can do for your brain today. Now, as a neuroscientist, I know that our brains, that is the thing in our head right now, that is the most complex structure known to humankind. But it's one thing to talk about the brain, and it's another to see it. So here is a real preserved human brain. And it's going to illustrate two key areas that we are going to talk about today. The first is the prefrontal cortex, right behind your forehead, critical for things like decision-making, focus, attention and your personality. The second key area is located in the temporal lobe, shown right here. You have two temporal lobes in your brain, the right and the left, and deep in the temporal lobe is a key structure critical for your ability to form and retain new long-term memories for facts and events. And that structure is called the hippocampus. So I've always been fascinated with the hippocampus. How could it be that an event that lasts just a moment, say, your first kiss, or the moment your first child was born, can form a memory that has changed your brain, that lasts an entire lifetime? That's what I want to understand. I wanted to start and record the activity of individual brain cells in the hippocampus as subjects were forming new memories. And essentially try and decode how those brief bursts of electrical activity, which is how neurons communicate with each other, how those brief bursts either allowed us to form a new memory, or did not. But a few years ago, I did something very unusual in science. As a full professor of neural science, I decided to completely switch my research program. Because I encountered something that was so amazing, with the potential to change so many lives that I had to study it. I discovered and I experienced the brain-changing effects of exercise. And I did it in a completely inadvertent way. I was actually at the height of all the memory work that I was doing -- data was pouring in, I was becoming known in my field for all of this memory work. And it should have been going great. It was, scientifically. But when I stuck my head out of my lab door, I noticed something. I had no social life. I spent too much time listening to those brain cells in a dark room, by myself. (Laughter) I didn't move my body at all. I had gained 25 pounds. And actually, it took me many years to realize it, I was actually miserable. And I shouldn't be miserable. And I went on a river-rafting trip -- by myself, because I had no social life. And I came back -- (Laughter) thinking, \"Oh, my God, I was the weakest person on that trip.\" And I came back with a mission. I said, \"I'm never going to feel like the weakest person on a river-rafting trip again.\" And that's what made me go to the gym. And I focused my type-A personality on going to all the exercise classes at the gym. I tried everything. I went to kickbox, dance, yoga, step class, and at first it was really hard. But what I noticed is that after every sweat-inducing workout that I tried, I had this great mood boost and this great energy boost. And that's what kept me going back to the gym. Well, I started feeling stronger. I started feeling better, I even lost that 25 pounds. And now, fast-forward a year and a half into this regular exercise program and I noticed something that really made me sit up and take notice. I was sitting at my desk, writing a research grant, and a thought went through my mind that had never gone through my mind before. And that thought was, \"Gee, grant-writing is going well today.\" And all the scientists -- (Laughter) yeah, all the scientists always laugh when I say that, because grant-writing never goes well. It is so hard; you're always pulling your hair out, trying to come up with that million-dollar-winning idea. But I realized that the grant-writing was going well, because I was able to focus and maintain my attention for longer than I had before. And my long-term memory -- what I was studying in my own lab -- seemed to be better in me. And that's when I put it together. Maybe all that exercise that I had included and added to my life was changing my brain. Maybe I did an experiment on myself without even knowing it. So as a curious neuroscientist, I went to the literature to see what I could find about what we knew about the effects of exercise on the brain. And what I found was an exciting and a growing literature that was essentially showing everything that I noticed in myself. Better mood, better energy, better memory, better attention. And the more I learned, the more I realized how powerful exercise was. Which eventually led me to the big decision to completely shift my research focus. And so now, after several years of really focusing on this question, I've come to the following conclusion: that exercise is the most transformative thing that you can do for your brain today for the following three reasons. Number one: it has immediate effects on your brain. A single workout that you do will immediately increase levels of neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline. That is going to increase your mood right after that workout, exactly what I was feeling. My lab showed that a single workout can improve your ability to shift and focus attention, and that focus improvement will last for at least two hours. And finally, studies have shown that a single workout will improve your reaction times which basically means that you are going to be faster at catching that cup of Starbucks that falls off the counter, which is very, very important. (Laughter) But these immediate effects are transient, they help you right after. What you have to do is do what I did, that is change your exercise regime, increase your cardiorespiratory function, to get the long-lasting effects. And these effects are long-lasting because exercise actually changes the brain's anatomy, physiology and function. Let's start with my favorite brain area, the hippocampus. The hippocampus -- or exercise actually produces brand new brain cells, new brain cells in the hippocampus, that actually increase its volume, as well as improve your long-term memory, OK? And that including in you and me. Number two: the most common finding in neuroscience studies, looking at effects of long-term exercise, is improved attention function dependent on your prefrontal cortex. You not only get better focus and attention, but the volume of the hippocampus increases as well. And finally, you not only get immediate effects of mood with exercise but those last for a long time. So you get long-lasting increases in those good mood neurotransmitters. But really, the most transformative thing that exercise will do is its protective effects on your brain. Here you can think about the brain like a muscle. The more you're working out, the bigger and stronger your hippocampus and prefrontal cortex gets. Why is that important? Because the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus are the two areas that are most susceptible to neurodegenerative diseases and normal cognitive decline in aging. So with increased exercise over your lifetime, you're not going to cure dementia or Alzheimer's disease, but what you're going to do is you're going to create the strongest, biggest hippocampus and prefrontal cortex so it takes longer for these diseases to actually have an effect. You can think of exercise, therefore, as a supercharged 401K for your brain, OK? And it's even better, because it's free. So this is the point in the talk where everybody says, \"That sounds so interesting, Wendy, but I really will only want to know one thing. And that is, just tell me the minimum amount of exercise I need to get all these changes.\" (Laughter) And so I'm going to tell you the answer to that question. First, good news: you don't have to become a triathlete to get these effects. The rule of thumb is you want to get three to four times a week exercise minimum 30 minutes an exercise session, and you want to get aerobic exercise in. That is, get your heart rate up. And the good news is, you don't have to go to the gym to get a very expensive gym membership. Add an extra walk around the block in your power walk. You see stairs -- take stairs. And power-vacuuming can be as good as the aerobics class that you were going to take at the gym. So I've gone from memory pioneer to exercise explorer. From going into the innermost workings of the brain, to trying to understand how exercise can improve our brain function, and my goal in my lab right now is to go beyond that rule of thumb that I just gave you -- three to four times a week, 30 minutes. I want to understand the optimum exercise prescription for you, at your age, at your fitness level, for your genetic background, to maximize the effects of exercise today and also to improve your brain and protect your brain the best for the rest of your life. But it's one thing to talk about exercise, and it's another to do it. So I'm going to invoke my power as a certified exercise instructor, to ask you all to stand up. (Laughter) We're going to do just one minute of exercise. It's call-and-response, just do what I do, say what I say, and make sure you don't punch your neighbor, OK? Music! (Upbeat music) Five, six, seven, eight, it's right, left, right, left. And I say, I am strong now. Let's hear you. Audience: I am strong now. Wendy Suzuki: Ladies, I am Wonder Woman-strong. Let's hear you! Audience: I am Wonder Woman-strong. WS: New move -- uppercut, right and left. I am inspired now. You say it! Audience: I am inspired now. WS: Last move -- pull it down, right and left, right and left. I say, I am on fire now! You say it. Audience: I am on fire now. WS: And done! OK, good job! (Applause) Thank you. I want to leave you with one last thought. And that is, bringing exercise in your life will not only give you a happier, more protective life today, but it will protect your brain from incurable diseases. And in this way it will change the trajectory of your life for the better. Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)",

An old-timey telephone switchboard? A dense urban landscape?\nThese are all common analogies for the brain, but most who use them know they are wholly imperfect comparisons. We humans thrive on metaphor and succinct stories, but our brains themselves can\u2019t be summed up so easily.\nMany fields of science are complicated, and of course anything under active scientific investigation is not fully understood. But the brain seems different. Extra complex. Extra mysterious. (Although it could be partly our brains\u2019 own biases that tell us how special they are.)\n\u201cAn electron is complicated. But when it comes to the brain, that simple statement acquires a whole new resonance,\u201d said Allen Institute neuroscientist Stephen Smith, Ph.D. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated enough to somehow explain all the richness of the human experience as we know it: All of our feelings, all of our subjective experience, all of human history, human art, human science. Wars, love, greed. The brain is at the root of all those things. Is it appealing to think that a simple machine, easy to understand, could explain all those things? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\nScientists have known for centuries that the brain is the seat of human thought, but we\u2019re still in the dark about how it works. There are\u2026 a lot of reasons for that. I asked four neuroscientists to expound on why we don\u2019t yet understand the human brain, and what it might take to get there.\nLet\u2019s start with some stats. Your brain has 86 billion neurons, give or take \u2014 on the same order as the number of stars in the Milky Way. If you look at the synapses, the connections between neurons, the numbers start to get beyond comprehension pretty quickly. The number of synapses in the human brain is estimated to be nearly a quadrillion, or 1,000,000,000,000,000. And each individual synapse contains different molecular switches. If you want to think about the brain in terms of an electrical system, a single synapse is not equivalent to a transistor \u2014 it would be more like a thousand transistors.\nTo make things more complicated, not all neurons are created equal. Scientists still don\u2019t know how many different kinds of neurons we have, but it\u2019s likely in the hundreds. Synapses themselves aren\u2019t all the same either. And that\u2019s not even taking into account all the other cells in our brain. Besides neurons, our brains contain lots of blood vessels and a third class of brain cells known collectively as glia \u2014 many of which are even more poorly understood than neurons.\nScientists are making progress breaking those numbers down into something more comprehensible. At the level of individual brain cells, research teams at the Allen Institute and elsewhere are making headway into sorting the cells into different categories, defined as \u201ccell types,\u201d as well as being able to record electrical activity from living human neurons using creative new techniques.\nMany neuroscientists study the brain of the lab mouse, in part with the hopes of understanding basic principles of the mammalian brain that could apply to our brains too. There\u2019s a long history of rodent neuroscience, and here too, new techniques are opening a larger window onto the mouse\u2019s kumquat-sized brain. Some of these methods allow researchers to eavesdrop on the activity of hundreds to thousands of neurons in the mouse brain.\n\u201cThe concept of cell types as something tractable is fairly recent,\u201d said Saskia De Vries, Ph.D., an Allen Institute neuroscientist. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned a lot more about what the pieces are that make up the brain and how to access them. And now we\u2019re starting to enter a new challenge, which is that instead of recording single cells, we\u2019re now recording hundreds to thousands of cells at once. But a lot of our analytical techniques are still lagging behind. We\u2019re suddenly working with really large datasets that might require more advanced math to really delve into and make sense of.\u201d\nSmith and many other scientists believe that to fully understand the human brain, we also need to understand where it came from. The evolution of the human brain is probably just as much of a mystery as how it works in its current incarnation, and there are many teams of scientists working on this problem from multiple different angles.\nBut let\u2019s take an even longer view. Smith considers the synapse, the direct connection point between two neurons, as a catalytic event in the evolution of complex multicellular animals. What did we do before synapses evolved? Organisms still had ways to send signals between their cells, using diffusion of small molecules over relatively larger distances. (Synapses themselves involve diffusion of molecular signals, but it\u2019s a very directed and short diffusion through a tiny space between neurons known as the synaptic cleft.)\nBefore the evolution of the neuron and the synapse, which is thought to be more than 600 million years ago, animals still needed to sense their environments and react to changing circumstances, two major functions that our brains now orchestrate. They may have changed their behavior to find more food or evade dangerous situations more readily than their neighbors. The molecules that enabled this early learning \u2014 the molecules that diffuse from one cell to many other cells \u2014 still exist in our brains today. They\u2019re known as neuropeptides or neuromodulators, and while they\u2019ve been somewhat overlooked in favor of the more tractable synapse, Smith believes they could hold important clues about how our brains work.\n\u201cThere are hundreds of these molecules in our brains, hundreds of specific receptors for these molecules and very intricate networks connecting them. They\u2019re still there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s relatively easy to see a synapse if you have the right kind of microscope, but these other signals are more invisible. We missed a lo\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Basso, PhD,Post-doctoral Research Associate at the Center for Neural Science and New York University \"These reports indicate that incorporating a regular exercise routine, and specifically aerobic exercise, into your daily regimen can not only prevent age-related degeneration but increase the size of the brain's most important learning and memory structure - the hippocampus\" The hippocampus, a seahorse-shaped structure located in the medial (middle) temporal lobe, is a brain area involved in learning and memory. This structure is essential for the formation of our long-term memories as well as helping us to navigate around our environment. The hippocampus is unique in that it is one of the only brain regions where new brain cells are produced, a process known as neurogenesis. The other location where this occurs is the olfactory bulb, a brain region involved in our sense of smell. Even though neurogenesis occurs throughout the lifespan, even into old age, the hippocampus shrinks as we age (Juraska & Lowry, 2012), which is thought to contribute to the propensity for some elderly individuals to forget once learned information and/or to get lost in once familiar locations. This is supported by studies which found that the greater the loss of hippocampal tissue, the greater the decline in these hippocampal-dependent behaviors (Grundman et al., 2003). In some individuals, this progression of hippocampal loss eventually leads to clinically diagnosed conditions such as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Schuff et al., 2009). AD is characterized in early stages by deficits in learning and memory, with a progression towards problems in language, movement and mood. This extension of symptoms is thought to be due to the underlying cellular-molecular pathology spreading from hippocampal regions to other, more frontal, cortical areas including the prefrontal cortex. On top of the age-related cell loss in the hippocampus, the production of new neurons decreases as we age (Kuhn et al., 1996), resulting in the aging hippocampus facing net tissue loss from two independent factors. Finding ways to decrease cell loss and increase cell growth is thus imperative in staving off age-related cognitive decline. Fortunately, researchers have found one solution not typically prescribed in the medical field: EXERCISE. Relatively recently, it was discovered that neurogenesis can be slowed down or sped up depending upon environmental influences, meaning that people are able to regulate neurogenesis in their own brains through modifications to lifestyle and behavior. For example, stress, drug use and depression cause the proliferation of new neurons to significantly decrease (Opendak & Gould, 2015). Exercise, on the other hand, significantly increases neurogenesis (van Praag et al., 1999). In one study of the ability of behavior to modulate neurogenesis, researchers compared young and old mice that either remained sedentary or had unlimited access to a running wheel for 45 days (van Praag et al., 2005). Mice that had access to the running wheel chose to run over 2.5 miles per day, which can be considered comparable to a good daily workout for any human. In the sedentary (control) group, young mice produced significantly more new neurons than old mice, as was expected. In the exercise groups, running significantly enhanced the rate of neurogenesis in both young and old rodents, with old exercised rodents exhibiting similar levels of neurogenesis to the young, sedentary mice. This remarkable study suggests that exercise can restore age-related declines in new cell growth in the brain! Further, the new neurons in both the old and young runners were similar in shape and structure, suggesting that age did not affect the health of these new cells. This study highlights the effectiveness of physical activity in increasing hippocampal neurogenesis in the aged rodent brain, but how does this apply to humans? For technical reasons, unlike in rodents, neurogenesis cannot be directly assessed in humans. However, researchers can use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate the size of certain brain regions as a proxy measure. Erickson and colleagues (2011) undertook a randomized controlled study to examine the effects of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise on hippocampal size. 120 healthy older adults (ages 55-80) were randomly assigned to either a walking group or a stretching and toning, control group. Subjects participated in either 40 minutes of walking or stretching and toning, three times per week for one year. The size of the hippocampus was analyzed using MRI both before and after the one-year intervention. The control group showed a 1.4% decrease in the size of the hippocampus, whereas the aerobic exercise group showed a 2% increase! This indicates that exercise is not only able to prevent normal age-related loss of the hippocampus but also increase hippocampal volume, as was suggested by the rodent studies. The functional purpose of neurogenesis is still unknown; however, one hypothesis is that it supports pattern separation, or the ability to distinguish between two very similar stimuli or events, a process essential to learning and memory. Therefore, another way to indirectly assess neurogenesis is to examine the behavior of pattern separation. One recent study examined the effects of 6 weeks of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) (sprint running on an outdoor track) on pattern separation in 13 healthy but sedentary young adults (D\u00c3\u00a9ry et al., 2013). Before and after the 6-week exercise program, pattern separation and cardiopulmonary fitness (VO2max) testing were conducted. Subjects were then classified as either responders (i.e., those that showed a large increase in VO2max) or non-responders (i.e., those that showed no or a small increase in VO2max).

Finding ways to decrease cell loss and increase cell growth is thus imperative in staving off age-related cognitive decline. Fortunately, researchers have found one solution not typically prescribed in the medical field: EXERCISE. Relatively recently, it was discovered that neurogenesis can be slowed down or sped up depending upon environmental influences, meaning that people are able to regulate neurogenesis in their own brains through modifications to lifestyle and behavior. For example, stress, drug use and depression cause the proliferation of new neurons to significantly decrease (Opendak & Gould, 2015). Exercise, on the other hand, significantly increases neurogenesis (van Praag et al., 1999). In one study of the ability of behavior to modulate neurogenesis, researchers compared young and old mice that either remained sedentary or had unlimited access to a running wheel for 45 days (van Praag et al., 2005). Mice that had access to the running wheel chose to run over 2.5 miles per day, which can be considered comparable to a good daily workout for any human. In the sedentary (control) group, young mice produced significantly more new neurons than old mice, as was expected. In the exercise groups, running significantly enhanced the rate of neurogenesis in both young and old rodents, with old exercised rodents exhibiting similar levels of neurogenesis to the young, sedentary mice. This remarkable study suggests that exercise can restore age-related declines in new cell growth in the brain! Further, the new neurons in both the old and young runners were similar in shape and structure, suggesting that age did not affect the health of these new cells. This study highlights the effectiveness of physical activity in increasing hippocampal neurogenesis in the aged rodent brain, but how does this apply to humans? For technical reasons, unlike in rodents, neurogenesis cannot be directly assessed in humans. However, researchers can use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate the size of certain brain regions as a proxy measure. Erickson and colleagues (2011) undertook a randomized controlled study to examine the effects of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise on hippocampal size. 120 healthy older adults (ages 55-80) were randomly assigned to either a walking group or a stretching and toning, control group. Subjects participated in either 40 minutes of walking or stretching and toning, three times per week for one year. The size of the hippocampus was analyzed using MRI both before and after the one-year intervention. The control group showed a 1.4% decrease in the size of the hippocampus, whereas the aerobic exercise group showed a 2% increase! This indicates that exercise is not only able to prevent normal age-related loss of the hippocampus but also increase hippocampal volume, as was suggested by the rodent studies. The functional purpose of neurogenesis is still unknown; however, one hypothesis is that it supports pattern separation, or the ability to distinguish between two very similar stimuli or events, a process essential to learning and memory. Therefore, another way to indirectly assess neurogenesis is to examine the behavior of pattern separation. One recent study examined the effects of 6 weeks of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) (sprint running on an outdoor track) on pattern separation in 13 healthy but sedentary young adults (D\u00c3\u00a9ry et al., 2013). Before and after the 6-week exercise program, pattern separation and cardiopulmonary fitness (VO2max) testing were conducted. Subjects were then classified as either responders (i.e., those that showed a large increase in VO2max) or non-responders (i.e., those that showed no or a small increase in VO2max). Compared \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

While most people understand that physical activity keeps their heart healthy and muscles strong, fewer realize the powerful connection between movement and brain function. Exercise and brain health are intimately linked in ways that scientists are only beginning to understand fully.\nWhen you exercise, your brain receives increased blood flow, delivering oxygen and nutrients that keep your nerve cells healthy. This improved circulation helps your brain work more efficiently and protects it from age-related decline. Physical activity also triggers the release of special proteins called growth factors that help brain cells grow and form new connections.\nThe relationship between exercise and brain health extends beyond just feeling good after a workout. Physical activity can actually change the structure of your brain, increasing the size of areas responsible for memory and learning. This means that every time you move your body, you\u2019re literally building a stronger, more resilient brain.\nModern research indicates that even moderate exercise can yield substantial neurological benefits. You don\u2019t need to become a marathon runner or spend hours in the gym. Simple activities like walking, swimming, or gardening can make a meaningful difference in your brain health when done consistently.\nThe benefits of exercise for nervous system function are both immediate and long-lasting. When you engage in physical activity, your nervous system responds in remarkable ways that support overall brain health and cognitive performance.\nExercise increases the production of new brain cells, a process called neurogenesis. This is particularly important in the hippocampus, the brain region responsible for learning and memory. More new brain cells mean better capacity for forming and storing memories throughout your life.\nPhysical activity also strengthens the connections between brain cells. These connections, called synapses, are like highways that allow information to travel quickly and efficiently throughout your nervous system. Stronger connections lead to faster thinking and improved problem-solving abilities.\nThe benefits of exercise for the nervous system include improved brain plasticity, which is your brain\u2019s ability to adapt and reorganize itself. This flexibility helps your brain recover from injuries, learn new skills, and maintain function as you age. Exercise essentially keeps your brain young and adaptable.\nRegular movement reduces inflammation throughout your nervous system. Chronic inflammation can damage brain cells and contribute to cognitive decline. By keeping inflammation in check, exercise helps protect your brain from harm and maintain optimal function.\nUnderstanding how physical activity improves memory reveals one of exercise\u2019s most impressive benefits. When you move your body, you trigger a chain reaction of events that enhances your ability to form, store, and retrieve memories.\nExercise increases blood flow to the hippocampus, your brain\u2019s primary memory center. This increased circulation delivers more oxygen and glucose, the fuel your brain cells need to function optimally. With better fuel supply, memory-forming processes work more efficiently.\nPhysical activity triggers the release of BDNF, often referred to as \u201cMiracle-Gro for the brain.\u201d This protein promotes the growth of new neurons and helps existing brain cells form stronger connections. These structural changes directly translate to improved memory capacity and recall ability.\nHow physical activity improves memory also involves the timing of exercise relative to learning. Research indicates that exercising before studying can enhance focus and attention, facilitating the encoding of new information. Exercising after learning helps consolidate memories, making them more likely to stick.\nDifferent types of exercise may benefit different aspects of memory:\nThe memory benefits of exercise aren\u2019t just temporary. Regular physical activity creates lasting changes in brain structure that support lifelong memory function and may help prevent age-related memory decline.\nExercise and neurological recovery work together in powerful ways to help the brain heal from injury and overcome challenges. Whether dealing with stroke, traumatic brain injury, or neurodegenerative conditions, physical activity plays a crucial role in the recovery process.\nAfter a brain injury, exercise promotes neuroplasticity\u2014the brain\u2019s remarkable ability to rewire itself and form new pathways around damaged areas. This rewiring enables healthy parts of the brain to assume functions previously handled by injured regions.\nExercise and neurological recovery also involve the growth of new blood vessels in the brain, a process called angiogenesis. These new blood vessels provide alternative routes for oxygen and nutrients to reach brain tissue, supporting healing and function.\nPhysical activity helps reduce secondary damage that can occur after a brain injury. Exercise helps control inflammation, prevents the death of additional brain cells, and promotes the removal of harmful substances that accumulate after injury.\nFor people with conditions like Parkinson\u2019s disease or multiple sclerosis, exercise can help maintain function and slow progression. Regular physical activity enhances balance, coordination, and motor control, while also supporting overall brain health.\nWhen it comes to the best exercises for brain function, variety is key. Different types of physical activity stimulate various aspects of brain health, so a well-rounded exercise program provides the most comprehensive benefits.\nAerobic exercises are among the best exercises for brain function because they increase heart rate and blood flow to the brain, thereby enhancing cognitive function. These activities include:\nStrength training also ranks among the best exercises for brain function. Resistance exercises help maintain muscle mass while stimul\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This systematic review aims to analyse the potential bidirectional effects of exercise on dopamine from young adulthood to old age. The article search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science in December 2020. The inclusion criteria were longitudinal and experimental study design; outcomes included dopamine and exercise; effect of exercise on dopamine and vice versa; adults; and articles published in English, Portuguese, or Spanish. Fifteen articles were included in the review. We observed robust findings concerning the potential effects of PA on dopamine, which notably seem to be observable across a wide range of participants characteristics (including age and sex), a variety of PA characteristics, and a broad set of methods to analyse dopamine. By contrast, regarding the potential effects of dopamine on PA, findings were mixed across studies. Thus, there are robust effects of physical exercise on dopamine. These findings further strengthen the idea that innovative approaches could include PA interventions for treating and preventing mental disorders. Therefore, it seems that PA is a potential alternative to deal with mental health issues.\nKeywords: neurotransmitter, brain, physical activity, mental health\nDopamine is a monoamine neurotransmitter that is known to be modulated by physical activity (PA) and exercise [1]. The physiological roles of dopamine were first described in 1957 [2]. Dopamine is synthesized in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, acting as a signalling molecule. Dopamine has essential roles in regulating motor neurons [3], spatial memory function [4], motivation, and reinforcement learning [5]. In addition, dopamine plays a crucial role in maintaining chemical balance within the central nervous system [6]. Concerning vulnerability, an excess or lack of dopamine can cause mental disorders, such as depression [6,7].\nDopamine is critical for the motor system [8], and it has a well-established role in motor functioning [9,10]. Dopamine synthesis seems to affect the will to practice PA [11,12] and plays an important role in cognitive\u2013motivational reward mechanisms for pursuing a certain behaviour such as PA [13]. This is because dopamine is a key neurotransmitter in the neural system, supporting cognitive control [14]. In turn, successful cognitive control is relevant for continuing PA engagement [15]. This mechanism is emphasized due to the association between the amount of striatal dopamine depletion and motor deficits observed in Parkinson\u2019s disease [16].\nOn the other hand, PA seems to influence the central dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and serotonergic systems [17]. In this regard, it has been observed that an increase in PA seems to result in a corresponding increase in neurotransmitter activity [1,18,19,20]. PA is known to change the dopamine system in the central nervous system [1], increasing dopamine receptor availability [21]. This association may have positive consequences, such as reducing the severity of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and other mental-related issues [22,23,24]. Studies in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease also suggest that exercise may provide a preventive and non-pharmaceutical therapeutic approach [25,26,27]. However, the studies that examined the influence of PA on dopamine were mostly conducted in animals [28,29,30], and they either used PA as a stress model or compared exercise with other stressors [28].\nThe mechanism that increases dopaminergic activity during exercise is mostly related to fatigue [31,32,33]. A decrease in dopamine neurotransmission during PA would hasten the onset of fatigue, while an increase in dopamine neurotransmission might delay the onset of fatigue [31]. Studies that manipulated the increase of dopamine synthesis [34], stimulated extracellular dopamine release [35], inhibited dopamine reuptake [36], or directly activated dopamine neurons and/or dopamine receptors [37] were performed to better understand the role of dopamine in exercise-induced fatigue. Some of these manipulations have been successful in impacting exercise-induced fatigue.\nThese two different lines of research suggest that there is a bidirectional relationship between the practice of PA and dopamine [7,11,12,38]. Yet, so far, the underlying mechanisms are highly debated. Moreover, the existing empirical research investigating this reciprocal association showed high heterogeneity across multiple study parameters and provided mixed and, thus far, inconclusive results [39]. Therefore, to advance the understanding regarding the reciprocal relationship between PA and dopamine synthesis, we conducted a systematic review of the existing evidence concerning the potential PA and exercise effects on dopamine, and vice versa, across adulthood.\nThe review was performed according to the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses [40]. We searched for articles that studied the relationship between PA and dopamine synthesis. As the relationship seems to be bidirectional [7,30,33,34], the research was extended to articles that explored the association in either direction. Thus, articles on the relationship between PA and dopamine, published in peer-reviewed journals up to 31 December 2020, were included.\nThe inclusion criteria of the articles were (a) longitudinal and experimental study design (study design criterion); (b) outcomes included dopamine and PA (outcome measure criterion); (c) effect of PA on dopamine and vice versa (relationship criterion); (d) adults (participants criterion); (e) articles published in English, Portuguese, or Spanish, regardless of the date of publication (language criterion).

This, together with the increase in crystalized intelligence and wisdom, is usually considered as a compensatory strategy. Research has demonstrated that physical activity might also act as a strategy and be one of the main factors that can slow down age-related perceptual and cognitive decline. Research also suggests that different types of physical exercise and sport lead to different changes in perceptual and cognitive skills as well as in several areas of the brain, especially those involving multiple domains, such as exergaming, dance or some sports. This review summarizes the findings of recent studies with older adults investigating the brain and cognitive benefits of different forms of physical exercise. Visuospatial attention, which plays a critical role in our daily lives, especially for older adults, is a central part of this analysis.\nThe purpose of the present review is to summarize previous and current findings related to changes in visuospatial attention as a function of age and physical exercise and sports activities (especially martial arts). First, we present a brief overview of the adaptation mechanisms used by older adults\u2019 brains, which involve functional and structural changes, to adjust to new demands. Second, we review the role of sport and physical exercise in the maintenance of visuospatial abilities that play an important role in well-being and healthy aging. Research with older adults, compared to younger people, could pose a number of challenges. It can be difficult to find older participants engaged in physical activity (PA), especially on a regular basis. Moreover, studies investigating visuospatial aspects such as peripheral vision or dynamic visual acuity in seniors are very scarce. In addition to cognitive and perceptual decline, older adults may suffer from ocular disease, refractive and oculo-motor decline or loss of visual skills. All these factors might contribute to the lack of research investigating PA and visuospatial attention in older adults. One of the main questions in the field of aging and PA concerns the type of exercise that might help to delay age-related cognitive and perceptual decline. This review examines and discusses the effects of aging on visuospatial attention and perceptual skills, and provides an overview of the potential beneficial effects of several types of physical exercise on brain and cognition. Finally, we look in particular at the effects of martial arts training (e.g., karate, judo, tai-chi) on aging and cognition. These topics are rarely dealt with in the area of PA and cognition in old age.\nSome cognitive processes, such as verbal abilities and implicit memory, do not decline with age [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. In fact, some factors, such as wisdom and procedural knowledge about how to act in certain situations, even improve with age [8]. Despite these positive results, aging is usually associated with the slowing down of processing speed [9, 10], a significant decline in working memory [7] and long-term memory [11], and difficulty inhibiting irrelevant stimuli [12]. Young and older adults show different brain activity when performing verbal working memory [13] and verbal long-term memory tasks [14, 15], possibly reflecting compensation maneuvers by seniors to obtain similar results as before. Older adults often have a tendency to engage both the left and right hemispheres [13], or even different areas than those used by young adults when performing the same task [7]. To account for these differences in cerebral functioning, Park and Reuter-Lorenz proposed the scaffolding theory [7, 16]. According to this theory, increased activation, especially in frontal areas, serves as a compensatory mechanism used by older adults to respond to the demands of certain cognitive tasks. However, it has been suggested [17] that such age-related neural dedifferentiation could contribute to rather than compensate for cognitive age-related declines, as the involvement of additional brain regions of older adults might in part be due to the decrease in neuronal selectivity, which would be a consequence of rather than compensation for cognitive decline.\nNeuroplasticity may also be considered as a compensatory mechanism. The brain is an adaptable organ, subject to a continuous learning process [18]. Neuroplasticity might modify the brain, both structurally and functionally, to respond to certain needs and demands [18, 19], reducing age-related slowing-down, and even delaying the onset of neurodegenerative diseases [20,21,22]. It is a learning phenomenon that occurs throughout the life cycle and that persists despite cognitive slowing, varying in its actions between individuals. In fact, large differences may be found as a function of life-style, with some older adults showing severe cognitive losses\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Basso, PhD,Post-doctoral Research Associate at the Center for Neural Science and New York University \"These reports indicate that incorporating a regular exercise routine, and specifically aerobic exercise, into your daily regimen can not only prevent age-related degeneration but increase the size of the brain's most important learning and memory structure - the hippocampus\" The hippocampus, a seahorse-shaped structure located in the medial (middle) temporal lobe, is a brain area involved in learning and memory. This structure is essential for the formation of our long-term memories as well as helping us to navigate around our environment. The hippocampus is unique in that it is one of the only brain regions where new brain cells are produced, a process known as neurogenesis. The other location where this occurs is the olfactory bulb, a brain region involved in our sense of smell. Even though neurogenesis occurs throughout the lifespan, even into old age, the hippocampus shrinks as we age (Juraska & Lowry, 2012), which is thought to contribute to the propensity for some elderly individuals to forget once learned information and/or to get lost in once familiar locations. This is supported by studies which found that the greater the loss of hippocampal tissue, the greater the decline in these hippocampal-dependent behaviors (Grundman et al., 2003). In some individuals, this progression of hippocampal loss eventually leads to clinically diagnosed conditions such as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Schuff et al., 2009). AD is characterized in early stages by deficits in learning and memory, with a progression towards problems in language, movement and mood. This extension of symptoms is thought to be due to the underlying cellular-molecular pathology spreading from hippocampal regions to other, more frontal, cortical areas including the prefrontal cortex. On top of the age-related cell loss in the hippocampus, the production of new neurons decreases as we age (Kuhn et al., 1996), resulting in the aging hippocampus facing net tissue loss from two independent factors. Finding ways to decrease cell loss and increase cell growth is thus imperative in staving off age-related cognitive decline. Fortunately, researchers have found one solution not typically prescribed in the medical field: EXERCISE. Relatively recently, it was discovered that neurogenesis can be slowed down or sped up depending upon environmental influences, meaning that people are able to regulate neurogenesis in their own brains through modifications to lifestyle and behavior. For example, stress, drug use and depression cause the proliferation of new neurons to significantly decrease (Opendak & Gould, 2015). Exercise, on the other hand, significantly increases neurogenesis (van Praag et al., 1999). In one study of the ability of behavior to modulate neurogenesis, researchers compared young and old mice that either remained sedentary or had unlimited access to a running wheel for 45 days (van Praag et al., 2005). Mice that had access to the running wheel chose to run over 2.5 miles per day, which can be considered comparable to a good daily workout for any human. In the sedentary (control) group, young mice produced significantly more new neurons than old mice, as was expected. In the exercise groups, running significantly enhanced the rate of neurogenesis in both young and old rodents, with old exercised rodents exhibiting similar levels of neurogenesis to the young, sedentary mice. This remarkable study suggests that exercise can restore age-related declines in new cell growth in the brain! Further, the new neurons in both the old and young runners were similar in shape and structure, suggesting that age did not affect the health of these new cells. This study highlights the effectiveness of physical activity in increasing hippocampal neurogenesis in the aged rodent brain, but how does this apply to humans? For technical reasons, unlike in rodents, neurogenesis cannot be directly assessed in humans. However, researchers can use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate the size of certain brain regions as a proxy measure. Erickson and colleagues (2011) undertook a randomized controlled study to examine the effects of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise on hippocampal size. 120 healthy older adults (ages 55-80) were randomly assigned to either a walking group or a stretching and toning, control group. Subjects participated in either 40 minutes of walking or stretching and toning, three times per week for one year. The size of the hippocampus was analyzed using MRI both before and after the one-year intervention. The control group showed a 1.4% decrease in the size of the hippocampus, whereas the aerobic exercise group showed a 2% increase! This indicates that exercise is not only able to prevent normal age-related loss of the hippocampus but also increase hippocampal volume, as was suggested by the rodent studies. The functional purpose of neurogenesis is still unknown; however, one hypothesis is that it supports pattern separation, or the ability to distinguish between two very similar stimuli or events, a process essential to learning and memory. Therefore, another way to indirectly assess neurogenesis is to examine the behavior of pattern separation. One recent study examined the effects of 6 weeks of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) (sprint running on an outdoor track) on pattern separation in 13 healthy but sedentary young adults (D\u00c3\u00a9ry et al., 2013). Before and after the 6-week exercise program, pattern separation and cardiopulmonary fitness (VO2max) testing were conducted. Subjects were then classified as either responders (i.e., those that showed a large increase in VO2max) or non-responders (i.e., those that showed no or a small increase in VO2max).

It can be difficult to find older participants engaged in physical activity (PA), especially on a regular basis. Moreover, studies investigating visuospatial aspects such as peripheral vision or dynamic visual acuity in seniors are very scarce. In addition to cognitive and perceptual decline, older adults may suffer from ocular disease, refractive and oculo-motor decline or loss of visual skills. All these factors might contribute to the lack of research investigating PA and visuospatial attention in older adults. One of the main questions in the field of aging and PA concerns the type of exercise that might help to delay age-related cognitive and perceptual decline. This review examines and discusses the effects of aging on visuospatial attention and perceptual skills, and provides an overview of the potential beneficial effects of several types of physical exercise on brain and cognition. Finally, we look in particular at the effects of martial arts training (e.g., karate, judo, tai-chi) on aging and cognition. These topics are rarely dealt with in the area of PA and cognition in old age.\nSome cognitive processes, such as verbal abilities and implicit memory, do not decline with age [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. In fact, some factors, such as wisdom and procedural knowledge about how to act in certain situations, even improve with age [8]. Despite these positive results, aging is usually associated with the slowing down of processing speed [9, 10], a significant decline in working memory [7] and long-term memory [11], and difficulty inhibiting irrelevant stimuli [12]. Young and older adults show different brain activity when performing verbal working memory [13] and verbal long-term memory tasks [14, 15], possibly reflecting compensation maneuvers by seniors to obtain similar results as before. Older adults often have a tendency to engage both the left and right hemispheres [13], or even different areas than those used by young adults when performing the same task [7]. To account for these differences in cerebral functioning, Park and Reuter-Lorenz proposed the scaffolding theory [7, 16]. According to this theory, increased activation, especially in frontal areas, serves as a compensatory mechanism used by older adults to respond to the demands of certain cognitive tasks. However, it has been suggested [17] that such age-related neural dedifferentiation could contribute to rather than compensate for cognitive age-related declines, as the involvement of additional brain regions of older adults might in part be due to the decrease in neuronal selectivity, which would be a consequence of rather than compensation for cognitive decline.\nNeuroplasticity may also be considered as a compensatory mechanism. The brain is an adaptable organ, subject to a continuous learning process [18]. Neuroplasticity might modify the brain, both structurally and functionally, to respond to certain needs and demands [18, 19], reducing age-related slowing-down, and even delaying the onset of neurodegenerative diseases [20,21,22]. It is a learning phenomenon that occurs throughout the life cycle and that persists despite cognitive slowing, varying in its actions between individuals. In fact, large differences may be found as a function of life-style, with some older adults showing severe cognitive losses\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This systematic review aims to analyse the potential bidirectional effects of exercise on dopamine from young adulthood to old age. The article search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science in December 2020. The inclusion criteria were longitudinal and experimental study design; outcomes included dopamine and exercise; effect of exercise on dopamine and vice versa; adults; and articles published in English, Portuguese, or Spanish. Fifteen articles were included in the review. We observed robust findings concerning the potential effects of PA on dopamine, which notably seem to be observable across a wide range of participants characteristics (including age and sex), a variety of PA characteristics, and a broad set of methods to analyse dopamine. By contrast, regarding the potential effects of dopamine on PA, findings were mixed across studies. Thus, there are robust effects of physical exercise on dopamine. These findings further strengthen the idea that innovative approaches could include PA interventions for treating and preventing mental disorders. Therefore, it seems that PA is a potential alternative to deal with mental health issues.\nKeywords: neurotransmitter, brain, physical activity, mental health\nDopamine is a monoamine neurotransmitter that is known to be modulated by physical activity (PA) and exercise [1]. The physiological roles of dopamine were first described in 1957 [2]. Dopamine is synthesized in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, acting as a signalling molecule. Dopamine has essential roles in regulating motor neurons [3], spatial memory function [4], motivation, and reinforcement learning [5]. In addition, dopamine plays a crucial role in maintaining chemical balance within the central nervous system [6]. Concerning vulnerability, an excess or lack of dopamine can cause mental disorders, such as depression [6,7].\nDopamine is critical for the motor system [8], and it has a well-established role in motor functioning [9,10]. Dopamine synthesis seems to affect the will to practice PA [11,12] and plays an important role in cognitive\u2013motivational reward mechanisms for pursuing a certain behaviour such as PA [13]. This is because dopamine is a key neurotransmitter in the neural system, supporting cognitive control [14]. In turn, successful cognitive control is relevant for continuing PA engagement [15]. This mechanism is emphasized due to the association between the amount of striatal dopamine depletion and motor deficits observed in Parkinson\u2019s disease [16].\nOn the other hand, PA seems to influence the central dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and serotonergic systems [17]. In this regard, it has been observed that an increase in PA seems to result in a corresponding increase in neurotransmitter activity [1,18,19,20]. PA is known to change the dopamine system in the central nervous system [1], increasing dopamine receptor availability [21]. This association may have positive consequences, such as reducing the severity of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and other mental-related issues [22,23,24]. Studies in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease also suggest that exercise may provide a preventive and non-pharmaceutical therapeutic approach [25,26,27]. However, the studies that examined the influence of PA on dopamine were mostly conducted in animals [28,29,30], and they either used PA as a stress model or compared exercise with other stressors [28].\nThe mechanism that increases dopaminergic activity during exercise is mostly related to fatigue [31,32,33]. A decrease in dopamine neurotransmission during PA would hasten the onset of fatigue, while an increase in dopamine neurotransmission might delay the onset of fatigue [31]. Studies that manipulated the increase of dopamine synthesis [34], stimulated extracellular dopamine release [35], inhibited dopamine reuptake [36], or directly activated dopamine neurons and/or dopamine receptors [37] were performed to better understand the role of dopamine in exercise-induced fatigue. Some of these manipulations have been successful in impacting exercise-induced fatigue.\nThese two different lines of research suggest that there is a bidirectional relationship between the practice of PA and dopamine [7,11,12,38]. Yet, so far, the underlying mechanisms are highly debated. Moreover, the existing empirical research investigating this reciprocal association showed high heterogeneity across multiple study parameters and provided mixed and, thus far, inconclusive results [39]. Therefore, to advance the understanding regarding the reciprocal relationship between PA and dopamine synthesis, we conducted a systematic review of the existing evidence concerning the potential PA and exercise effects on dopamine, and vice versa, across adulthood.\nThe review was performed according to the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses [40]. We searched for articles that studied the relationship between PA and dopamine synthesis. As the relationship seems to be bidirectional [7,30,33,34], the research was extended to articles that explored the association in either direction. Thus, articles on the relationship between PA and dopamine, published in peer-reviewed journals up to 31 December 2020, were included.\nThe inclusion criteria of the articles were (a) longitudinal and experimental study design (study design criterion); (b) outcomes included dopamine and PA (outcome measure criterion); (c) effect of PA on dopamine and vice versa (relationship criterion); (d) adults (participants criterion); (e) articles published in English, Portuguese, or Spanish, regardless of the date of publication (language criterion). Studies were excluded from analysis if they were\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This, together with the increase in crystalized intelligence and wisdom, is usually considered as a compensatory strategy. Research has demonstrated that physical activity might also act as a strategy and be one of the main factors that can slow down age-related perceptual and cognitive decline. Research also suggests that different types of physical exercise and sport lead to different changes in perceptual and cognitive skills as well as in several areas of the brain, especially those involving multiple domains, such as exergaming, dance or some sports. This review summarizes the findings of recent studies with older adults investigating the brain and cognitive benefits of different forms of physical exercise. Visuospatial attention, which plays a critical role in our daily lives, especially for older adults, is a central part of this analysis.\nThe purpose of the present review is to summarize previous and current findings related to changes in visuospatial attention as a function of age and physical exercise and sports activities (especially martial arts). First, we present a brief overview of the adaptation mechanisms used by older adults\u2019 brains, which involve functional and structural changes, to adjust to new demands.

An old-timey telephone switchboard? A dense urban landscape?\nThese are all common analogies for the brain, but most who use them know they are wholly imperfect comparisons. We humans thrive on metaphor and succinct stories, but our brains themselves can\u2019t be summed up so easily.\nMany fields of science are complicated, and of course anything under active scientific investigation is not fully understood. But the brain seems different. Extra complex. Extra mysterious. (Although it could be partly our brains\u2019 own biases that tell us how special they are.)\n\u201cAn electron is complicated. But when it comes to the brain, that simple statement acquires a whole new resonance,\u201d said Allen Institute neuroscientist Stephen Smith, Ph.D. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated enough to somehow explain all the richness of the human experience as we know it: All of our feelings, all of our subjective experience, all of human history, human art, human science. Wars, love, greed. The brain is at the root of all those things. Is it appealing to think that a simple machine, easy to understand, could explain all those things? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\nScientists have known for centuries that the brain is the seat of human thought, but we\u2019re still in the dark about how it works. There are\u2026 a lot of reasons for that. I asked four neuroscientists to expound on why we don\u2019t yet understand the human brain, and what it might take to get there.\nLet\u2019s start with some stats. Your brain has 86 billion neurons, give or take \u2014 on the same order as the number of stars in the Milky Way. If you look at the synapses, the connections between neurons, the numbers start to get beyond comprehension pretty quickly. The number of synapses in the human brain is estimated to be nearly a quadrillion, or 1,000,000,000,000,000. And each individual synapse contains different molecular switches. If you want to think about the brain in terms of an electrical system, a single synapse is not equivalent to a transistor \u2014 it would be more like a thousand transistors.\nTo make things more complicated, not all neurons are created equal. Scientists still don\u2019t know how many different kinds of neurons we have, but it\u2019s likely in the hundreds. Synapses themselves aren\u2019t all the same either. And that\u2019s not even taking into account all the other cells in our brain. Besides neurons, our brains contain lots of blood vessels and a third class of brain cells known collectively as glia \u2014 many of which are even more poorly understood than neurons.\nScientists are making progress breaking those numbers down into something more comprehensible. At the level of individual brain cells, research teams at the Allen Institute and elsewhere are making headway into sorting the cells into different categories, defined as \u201ccell types,\u201d as well as being able to record electrical activity from living human neurons using creative new techniques.\nMany neuroscientists study the brain of the lab mouse, in part with the hopes of understanding basic principles of the mammalian brain that could apply to our brains too. There\u2019s a long history of rodent neuroscience, and here too, new techniques are opening a larger window onto the mouse\u2019s kumquat-sized brain. Some of these methods allow researchers to eavesdrop on the activity of hundreds to thousands of neurons in the mouse brain.\n\u201cThe concept of cell types as something tractable is fairly recent,\u201d said Saskia De Vries, Ph.D., an Allen Institute neuroscientist. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned a lot more about what the pieces are that make up the brain and how to access them. And now we\u2019re starting to enter a new challenge, which is that instead of recording single cells, we\u2019re now recording hundreds to thousands of cells at once. But a lot of our analytical techniques are still lagging behind. We\u2019re suddenly working with really large datasets that might require more advanced math to really delve into and make sense of.\u201d\nSmith and many other scientists believe that to fully understand the human brain, we also need to understand where it came from. The evolution of the human brain is probably just as much of a mystery as how it works in its current incarnation, and there are many teams of scientists working on this problem from multiple different angles.\nBut let\u2019s take an even longer view. Smith considers the synapse, the direct connection point between two neurons, as a catalytic event in the evolution of complex multicellular animals. What did we do before synapses evolved? Organisms still had ways to send signals between their cells, using diffusion of small molecules over relatively larger distances. (Synapses themselves involve diffusion of molecular signals, but it\u2019s a very directed and short diffusion through a tiny space between neurons known as the synaptic cleft.)\nBefore the evolution of the neuron and the synapse, which is thought to be more than 600 million years ago, animals still needed to sense their environments and react to changing circumstances, two major functions that our brains now orchestrate. They may have changed their behavior to find more food or evade dangerous situations more readily than their neighbors. The molecules that enabled this early learning \u2014 the molecules that diffuse from one cell to many other cells \u2014 still exist in our brains today. They\u2019re known as neuropeptides or neuromodulators, and while they\u2019ve been somewhat overlooked in favor of the more tractable synapse, Smith believes they could hold important clues about how our brains work.\n\u201cThere are hundreds of these molecules in our brains, hundreds of specific receptors for these molecules and very intricate networks connecting them. They\u2019re still there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s relatively easy to see a synapse if you have the right kind of microscope, but these other signals are more invisible.

Therefore, it seems that PA is a potential alternative to deal with mental health issues.\nKeywords: neurotransmitter, brain, physical activity, mental health\nDopamine is a monoamine neurotransmitter that is known to be modulated by physical activity (PA) and exercise [1]. The physiological roles of dopamine were first described in 1957 [2]. Dopamine is synthesized in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, acting as a signalling molecule. Dopamine has essential roles in regulating motor neurons [3], spatial memory function [4], motivation, and reinforcement learning [5]. In addition, dopamine plays a crucial role in maintaining chemical balance within the central nervous system [6]. Concerning vulnerability, an excess or lack of dopamine can cause mental disorders, such as depression [6,7].\nDopamine is critical for the motor system [8], and it has a well-established role in motor functioning [9,10]. Dopamine synthesis seems to affect the will to practice PA [11,12] and plays an important role in cognitive\u2013motivational reward mechanisms for pursuing a certain behaviour such as PA [13]. This is because dopamine is a key neurotransmitter in the neural system, supporting cognitive control [14]. In turn, successful cognitive control is relevant for continuing PA engagement [15]. This mechanism is emphasized due to the association between the amount of striatal dopamine depletion and motor deficits observed in Parkinson\u2019s disease [16].\nOn the other hand, PA seems to influence the central dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and serotonergic systems [17]. In this regard, it has been observed that an increase in PA seems to result in a corresponding increase in neurotransmitter activity [1,18,19,20]. PA is known to change the dopamine system in the central nervous system [1], increasing dopamine receptor availability [21]. This association may have positive consequences, such as reducing the severity of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and other mental-related issues [22,23,24]. Studies in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease also suggest that exercise may provide a preventive and non-pharmaceutical therapeutic approach [25,26,27]. However, the studies that examined the influence of PA on dopamine were mostly conducted in animals [28,29,30], and they either used PA as a stress model or compared exercise with other stressors [28].\nThe mechanism that increases dopaminergic activity during exercise is mostly related to fatigue [31,32,33]. A decrease in dopamine neurotransmission during PA would hasten the onset of fatigue, while an increase in dopamine neurotransmission might delay the onset of fatigue [31]. Studies that manipulated the increase of dopamine synthesis [34], stimulated extracellular dopamine release [35], inhibited dopamine reuptake [36], or directly activated dopamine neurons and/or dopamine receptors [37] were performed to better understand the role of dopamine in exercise-induced fatigue. Some of these manipulations have been successful in impacting exercise-induced fatigue.\nThese two different lines of research suggest that there is a bidirectional relationship between the practice of PA and dopamine [7,11,12,38]. Yet, so far, the underlying mechanisms are highly debated. Moreover, the existing empirical research investigating this reciprocal association showed high heterogeneity across multiple study parameters and provided mixed and, thus far, inconclusive results [39]. Therefore, to advance the understanding regarding the reciprocal relationship between PA and dopamine synthesis, we conducted a systematic review of the existing evidence concerning the potential PA and exercise effects on dopamine, and vice versa, across adulthood.\nThe review was performed according to the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses [40]. We searched for articles that studied the relationship between PA and dopamine synthesis. As the relationship seems to be bidirectional [7,30,33,34], the research was extended to articles that explored the association in either direction. Thus, articles on the relationship between PA and dopamine, published in peer-reviewed journals up to 31 December 2020, were included.\nThe inclusion criteria of the articles were (a) longitudinal and experimental study design (study design criterion); (b) outcomes included dopamine and PA (outcome measure criterion); (c) effect of PA on dopamine and vice versa (relationship criterion); (d) adults (participants criterion); (e) articles published in English, Portuguese, or Spanish, regardless of the date of publication (language criterion).

These chair exercises and other simple fitness tips can keep you active and improve your health and well-being.\nYou don\u2019t need to have full mobility to experience the health benefits of exercise. If injury, disability, illness, or weight problems have limited your mobility, there are still plenty of ways you can use exercise to boost your mood, ease depression, relieve stress and anxiety, enhance your self-esteem, and improve your whole outlook on life.\nWhen you exercise, your body releases endorphins that energize your mood, relieve stress, boost your self-esteem, and trigger an overall sense of well-being. If you\u2019re a regular exerciser currently sidelined with an injury, you\u2019ve probably noticed how inactivity has caused your mood and energy levels to sink. This is understandable: exercise has such a powerful effect on mood that it can treat mild to moderate depression as effectively as antidepressant medication. However, an injury doesn\u2019t mean your mental and emotional health is doomed to decline. While some injuries respond best to total rest, most simply require you to reevaluate your exercise routine with help from your doctor or physical therapist.\nIf you have a disability, severe weight problem, chronic breathing condition, diabetes, arthritis, or other ongoing illness, you may think that your health problems make it impossible for you to exercise effectively, if at all. Or perhaps you\u2019ve become frail with age and are worried about falling or injuring yourself if you try to exercise. The truth is, regardless of your age, current physical condition, and whether you\u2019ve exercised in the past or not, there are plenty of ways to overcome your mobility issues and reap the physical, mental, and emotional rewards of exercise.\nIt\u2019s important to remember that any type of exercise will offer health benefits. Mobility issues inevitably make some types of exercise easier than others, but no matter your physical situation, you should aim to incorporate three different types of exercise into your routines:\nCardiovascular exercises that raise your heart rate and increase your endurance. These can include walking, running, cycling, dancing, tennis, swimming, water aerobics, or \u201caquajogging\u201d. Many people with mobility issues find exercising in water especially beneficial as it supports the body and reduces the risk of muscle or joint discomfort. Even if you\u2019re confined to a chair or wheelchair, it\u2019s still possible to perform cardiovascular exercise.\nStrength training exercises involve using weights or other resistance to build muscle and bone mass, improve balance, and prevent falls. If you have limited mobility in your legs, your focus will be on upper body strength training. Similarly, if you have a shoulder injury, for example, your focus will be more on strength training your legs and core.\nFlexibility exercises help enhance your range of motion, prevent injury, and reduce pain and stiffness. These may include stretching exercises and yoga. Even if you have limited mobility in your legs, for example, you may still benefit from stretches and flexibility exercises to prevent or delay further muscle atrophy.\nTo exercise successfully with limited mobility, illness, or weight problems, start by getting medical clearance. Talk to your doctor, physical therapist, or other health care provider about activities suitable for your medical condition or mobility issue.\nYour doctor or physical therapist can help you find a suitable exercise routine. Ask:\nStart slow and gradually increase your activity level. Start with an activity you enjoy, go at your own pace, and keep your goals manageable. Accomplishing even the smallest fitness goals will help you gain body confidence and keep you motivated.\nMake exercise part of your daily life. Plan to exercise at the same time every day and combine a variety of exercises to keep you from getting bored.\nStick with it. It takes about a month for a new activity to become a habit. Write down your reasons for exercising and a list of goals and post them somewhere visible to keep you motivated. Focus on short-term goals, such as improving your mood and reducing stress, rather than goals such as weight loss, which can take longer to achieve. It\u2019s easier to stay motivated if you enjoy what you\u2019re doing, so find ways to make exercise fun. Listen to music or watch a TV show while you work out, or exercise with friends.\nExpect ups and downs. Don\u2019t be discouraged if you skip a few days or even a few weeks. It happens. Just get started again and slowly build up to your old momentum.\nStop exercising if you experience pain, discomfort, nausea, dizziness, lightheadedness, chest pain, irregular heartbeat, shortness of breath, or clammy hands. Listening to your body is the best way to avoid injury. If you continually experience pain after 15 minutes of exercise, for example, limit your workouts to 5 or 10 minutes and instead exercise more frequently.\nAvoid activity involving an injured body part. If you have an upper body injury, exercise your lower body while the injury heals, and vice versa. When exercising after an injury has healed, start back slowly, using lighter weights and less resistance.\nWarm up, stretch, and cool down. Warm up with a few minutes of light activity such as walking, arm swinging, and shoulder rolls, followed by some light stretching (avoid deep stretches when your muscles are cold). After your exercise routine, whether it\u2019s cardiovascular, strength training, or flexibility exercise, cool down with a few more minutes of light activity and deeper stretching.\nDrink plenty of water. Your body performs best when it\u2019s properly hydrated.\nWear appropriate clothing, such as supportive footwear and comfortable clothes that won\u2019t restrict your movement.\nAdd a mindfulness element. Whether you\u2019re exercising in a chair or walking outside, you\u2019ll experience a greater benefit if you pay attention to you\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This systematic review aims to analyse the potential bidirectional effects of exercise on dopamine from young adulthood to old age. The article search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science in December 2020. The inclusion criteria were longitudinal and experimental study design; outcomes included dopamine and exercise; effect of exercise on dopamine and vice versa; adults; and articles published in English, Portuguese, or Spanish. Fifteen articles were included in the review. We observed robust findings concerning the potential effects of PA on dopamine, which notably seem to be observable across a wide range of participants characteristics (including age and sex), a variety of PA characteristics, and a broad set of methods to analyse dopamine. By contrast, regarding the potential effects of dopamine on PA, findings were mixed across studies. Thus, there are robust effects of physical exercise on dopamine. These findings further strengthen the idea that innovative approaches could include PA interventions for treating and preventing mental disorders.

Engaging in regular physical activity contributes to emotional well-being, reduces stress, and enhances cognitive function. Through mechanisms such as endorphin release, stress reduction, and improved self-esteem, exercise provides a powerful, natural way to support mental health. Different forms of exercise, including aerobic exercise and strength training, can have profound impacts on both emotional and psychological well-being.\nOne of the key mental health benefits of exercise is its ability to trigger the release of endorphins, often referred to as the body\u2019s \u201cfeel-good\u201d chemicals. Endorphins are neurotransmitters that help alleviate pain and elevate mood, providing a natural remedy for feelings of anxiety, stress, and depression [1].\nWhen you engage in physical activity, especially intense exercise such as running or cycling, the brain releases higher levels of endorphins. This process leads to what is commonly known as a \u201crunner\u2019s high\u201d\u2014a euphoric feeling that boosts mood.\n\u00abBoecker and colleagues conducted a study to examine the effect of intense exercise (2 hours of running) in 10 trained male athletes (ages 33 to 40, with a minimum of 4 hours of weekly training for the past 2 years). Compared to rest, 30 minutes after running, mood (euphoria and happiness) was significantly enhanced\u00bb [2]\nOver time, regular physical activity can contribute to long-term mental health improvements by balancing emotions and reducing symptoms of depression.\nBeyond endorphins, exercise stimulates the production of other important neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine, which are associated with mood regulation and emotional well-being. By increasing the availability of these chemicals in the brain, exercise acts as a natural antidepressant, helping individuals manage their mental health more effectively [3].\nPhysical activity is also highly effective in reducing stress. Exercise lowers levels of cortisol, the hormone that is released in response to stress [3]. Elevated cortisol levels can lead to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues if left unchecked. By regulating cortisol production, exercise helps calm the mind and alleviate stress.\nEngaging in aerobic exercise such as running, swimming, or cycling increases oxygen flow to the brain, helping to release tension and clear the mind. These activities help lower cortisol levels and promote a sense of relaxation, allowing individuals to focus and manage their stress more effectively [4].\nIn addition to aerobic activities, exercises like yoga and Pilates also integrate mindfulness and deep breathing techniques that help reduce stress and promote mental clarity. These practices are particularly effective for calming the nervous system and fostering emotional balance.\nRegular physical activity not only improves physical health but also enhances self-esteem and body image. Achieving fitness goals, whether through strength training or aerobic exercise, provides a sense of accomplishment that can positively impact mental health. Over time, the physical changes from exercise, such as improved muscle tone and weight management, contribute to a more positive self-perception [5].\nReaching personal fitness milestones\u2014such as lifting heavier weights or completing a long-distance run\u2014boosts confidence and reinforces a sense of mastery over one\u2019s body. This sense of control and accomplishment helps individuals develop a stronger sense of self-worth, which is particularly beneficial for those experiencing anxiety, depression, or low self-esteem.\nAdditionally, regular exercise fosters a sense of resilience and perseverance, as individuals learn to push through physical and mental challenges. These qualities translate into other areas of life, empowering individuals to manage daily stressors with more confidence and emotional stability.\nTo experience the mental health benefits of exercise, individuals should aim to incorporate physical activity into their daily routines. This can include:\nAerobic exercise\u2014which includes activities like running, swimming, dancing, and cycling\u2014is one of the most effective ways to improve mental health. Regular aerobic activity boosts cardiovascular health and enhances cognitive function by increasing blood flow to the brain. This not only improves mood but also sharpens focus, memory, and cognitive performance [6].\nResearch has shown that aerobic exercise can significantly reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. By promoting the release of endorphins and other neurotransmitters, aerobic activities create a positive feedback loop that improves emotional regulation. Furthermore, aerobic exercise has been linked to better sleep, which is critical for maintaining emotional balance and reducing stress [7].\nStrength training, which includes weightlifting, bodyweight exercises, and resistance workouts, offers significant mental health benefits. Beyond physical strength, these exercises help develop emotional resilience and mental toughness. The focus and discipline required for strength training foster self-discipline and perseverance, traits that contribute to improved emotional regulation [8].\nStrength training is particularly effective for reducing symptoms of anxiety. Lifting weights and engaging in resistance exercises stimulate endorphin production, boosting mood and alleviating anxious thoughts. Additionally, strength training empowers individuals by providing a sense of control over their physical and emotional health, which can lead to greater self-confidence and reduced feelings of helplessness.\nExercise plays a critical role in supporting mental health by promoting endorphin release, regulating stress through cortisol reduction, and boosting self-esteem through goal achievement. Engaging in both aerobic exercise and strength training offers a holistic approach to emotion\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

In fact, exercise can be a great ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nImmunize Nevada\nExercise is widely recognized for its physical health benefits, but its role in promoting mental health is equally significant. Engaging in regular physical activity contributes to emotional well-being, reduces stress, and enhances cognitive function. Through mechanisms such as endorphin release, stress reduction, and improved self-esteem, exercise provides a powerful, natural way to support mental health. Different forms of exercise, including aerobic exercise and strength training, can have profound impacts on both emotional and psychological well-being.\nOne of the key mental health benefits of exercise is its ability to trigger the release of endorphins, often referred to as the body\u2019s \u201cfeel-good\u201d chemicals. Endorphins are neurotransmitters that help alleviate pain and elevate mood, providing a natural remedy for feelings of anxiety, stress, and depression [1].\nWhen you engage in physical activity, especially intense exercise such as running or cycling, the brain releases higher levels of endorphins. This process leads to what is commonly known as a \u201crunner\u2019s high\u201d\u2014a euphoric feeling that boosts mood.\n\u00abBoecker and colleagues conducted a study to examine the effect of intense exercise (2 hours of running) in 10 trained male athletes (ages 33 to 40, with a minimum of 4 hours of weekly training for the past 2 years). Compared to rest, 30 minutes after running, mood (euphoria and happiness) was significantly enhanced\u00bb [2]\nOver time, regular physical activity can contribute to long-term mental health improvements by balancing emotions and reducing symptoms of depression.\nBeyond endorphins, exercise stimulates the production of other important neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine, which are associated with mood regulation and emotional well-being. By increasing the availability of these chemicals in the brain, exercise acts as a natural antidepressant, helping individuals manage their mental health more effectively [3].\nPhysical activity is also highly effective in reducing stress. Exercise lowers levels of cortisol, the hormone that is released in response to stress [3]. Elevated cortisol levels can lead to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues if left unchecked. By regulating cortisol production, exercise helps calm the mind and alleviate stress.\nEngaging in aerobic exercise such as running, swimming, or cycling increases oxygen flow to the brain, helping to release tension and clear the mind. These activities help lower cortisol levels and promote a sense of relaxation, allowing individuals to focus and manage their stress more effectively [4].\nIn addition to aerobic activities, exercises like yoga and Pilates also integrate mindfulness and deep breathing techniques that help reduce stress and promote mental clarity. These practices are particularly effective for calming the nervous system and fostering emotional balance.\nRegular physical activity not only improves physical health but also enhances self-esteem and body image. Achieving fitness goals, whether through strength training or aerobic exercise, provides a sense of accomplishment that can positively impact mental health. Over time, the physical changes from exercise, such as improved muscle tone and weight management, contribute to a more positive self-perception [5].\nReaching personal fitness milestones\u2014such as lifting heavier weights or completing a long-distance run\u2014boosts confidence and reinforces a sense of mastery over one\u2019s body. This sense of control and accomplishment helps individuals develop a stronger sense of self-worth, which is particularly beneficial for those experiencing anxiety, depression, or low self-esteem.\nAdditionally, regular exercise fosters a sense of resilience and perseverance, as individuals learn to push through physical and mental challenges. These qualities translate into other areas of life, empowering individuals to manage daily stressors with more confidence and emotional stability.\nTo experience the mental health benefits of exercise, individuals should aim to incorporate physical activity into their daily routines. This can include:\nAerobic exercise\u2014which includes activities like running, swimming, dancing, and cycling\u2014is one of the most effective ways to improve mental health. Regular aerobic activity boosts cardiovascular health and enhances cognitive function by increasing blood flow to the brain. This not only improves mood but also sharpens focus, memory, and cognitive performance [6].\nResearch has shown that aerobic exercise can significantly reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. By promoting the release of endorphins and other neurotransmitters, aerobic activities create a positive feedback loop that improves emotional regulation. Furthermore, aerobic exercise has been linked to better sleep, which is critical for maintaining emotional balance and reducing stress [7].\nStrength training, which includes weightlifting, bodyweight exercises, and resistance workouts, offers significant mental health benefits. Beyond physical strength, these exercises help develop emotional resilience and mental toughness. The focus and discipline required for strength training foster self-discipline and perseverance, traits that contribute to improved emotional regulation [8].\nStrength training is particularly effective for reducing symptoms of anxiety. Lifting weights and engaging in resistance exercises stimulate endorphin production, boosting mood and alleviating anxious thoughts. Additionally, strength training empowers individuals by providing a sense of control over their physical and emotional health, which can lead to greater self-confidence and reduced feelings of helplessness.\nExercise plays a critical role in supporting mental health by promoting endorphin release, regulating stress through cortisol reduction, and boosting self-esteem through goal achievement. Engaging in both aerobic exercise and strength training offers a holistic approach to emotion\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

And what\u2019s good for the body also benefits the brain.\n\"There is no surefire medical tool that can delay the onset of dementia and other memory problems,\" says Dr. Julie Brody Magid, Clinical Director of the Memory Disorders Assessment Clinic at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital. \"Certain drugs may help slow mental decline when symptoms arrive. But cardio exercise has consistently proved to help protect the brain from cognitive decline and perhaps even improve cognitive functioning if issues arise.\"\nHow does cardio boost your brain? There are many theories. Research has focused on how it can strengthen the heart, promote artery health, improve blood flow to the brain, fight inflammation, and increase key chemicals that encourage new brain cell growth.\nFor instance, cardio activates a molecule called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF helps repair brain cells and make new brain cells. It\u2019s also been associated with a larger hippocampus, the brain region that stores and retrieves memories.\nA study published online Aug. 20, 2021, by Nature Metabolism found that the hormone irisin, produced by muscles during exercise, protected mice against brain inflammation.\nThe study also suggested that increasing irisin through exercise may help counter the effects of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. (While this was only an animal study, the researchers speculated based on previous research that the effect could work with humans.)\nCardio exercise strengthens the heart and improves blood flow throughout the body, including to your brain, specifically its white matter. This helps protect against vascular dementia caused by reduced blood flow to the brain. Better blood flow also can clear toxins from the brain, further protecting against inflammation and promoting neurogenesis \u2014 the development of new brain cells.\nIt\u2019s never too late to adopt brain-protecting exercise, even if you show early signs of memory loss. A study published online March 23, 2021, by the Journal of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease looked at how cardio exercise affects people with early cognitive decline. Those who followed a yearlong moderate-to-vigorous cardio program scored better on cognitive tests than those who only did a stretching routine. Specifically, they improved their executive function skills, which involve planning and decision making. Most exercisers did brisk walking, but others did swimming, cycling, or ballroom dancing. They followed a 30-minute, three-day-a-week routine for six months and then increased it to five workouts per week.\nHow much cardio does your brain need? Research continues to explore this question, but it may depend on your fitness level. A 2015 study found that 20 minutes of moderate exercise produced the most significant cognitive boost for nonathletic people. Yet research in the January 2021 Journal of Sports Science found that 45 minutes was ideal for trained cyclists and triathletes.\nUntil more is known, aim for the recommended federal guidelines of at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise, five days a week, says Dr. Brody Magid. She suggests that you establish a regimen that is approved by your primary care physician and stick with it.\nAs for the best type of cardio, again there is no clear winner. However, challenging yourself is vital. \"Just like your body acclimates and doesn\u2019t get stronger when you do the same workout all the time, your brain also can get too comfortable with routine exercise,\" says Dr. Brody Magid.\nShe suggests mixing up your cardio workouts with varied intervals and trying new, challenging activities whenever possible. If you regularly walk, try swimming. If you cycle, try hiking. Also, consider cardio that includes mental stimulation and challenges. \"These offer a two-for-one combination of working your thinking skills while you work out your body,\" says Dr. Brody Magid.\nFor instance, non-contact boxing forces you to remember various sequences of punches, so you have to concentrate and stay focused. With racquet sports like tennis or pickleball, you to need to react to shots from an opponent and then plan and execute your return. \"The bottom line is that when it comes to the brain and exercise, any movement is better than none, and the more you move, the more you boost and protect your brain,\" says Dr. Brody Magid.\nMatthew Solan, Executive Editor, Harvard Men's Health Watch\nAs a service to our readers, Harvard Health Publishing provides access to our library of archived content.

Endorphins are neurotransmitters that help alleviate pain and elevate mood, providing a natural remedy for feelings of anxiety, stress, and depression [1].\nWhen you engage in physical activity, especially intense exercise such as running or cycling, the brain releases higher levels of endorphins. This process leads to what is commonly known as a \u201crunner\u2019s high\u201d\u2014a euphoric feeling that boosts mood.\n\u00abBoecker and colleagues conducted a study to examine the effect of intense exercise (2 hours of running) in 10 trained male athletes (ages 33 to 40, with a minimum of 4 hours of weekly training for the past 2 years). Compared to rest, 30 minutes after running, mood (euphoria and happiness) was significantly enhanced\u00bb [2]\nOver time, regular physical activity can contribute to long-term mental health improvements by balancing emotions and reducing symptoms of depression.\nBeyond endorphins, exercise stimulates the production of other important neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine, which are associated with mood regulation and emotional well-being. By increasing the availability of these chemicals in the brain, exercise acts as a natural antidepressant, helping individuals manage their mental health more effectively [3].\nPhysical activity is also highly effective in reducing stress. Exercise lowers levels of cortisol, the hormone that is released in response to stress [3]. Elevated cortisol levels can lead to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues if left unchecked. By regulating cortisol production, exercise helps calm the mind and alleviate stress.\nEngaging in aerobic exercise such as running, swimming, or cycling increases oxygen flow to the brain, helping to release tension and clear the mind. These activities help lower cortisol levels and promote a sense of relaxation, allowing individuals to focus and manage their stress more effectively [4].\nIn addition to aerobic activities, exercises like yoga and Pilates also integrate mindfulness and deep breathing techniques that help reduce stress and promote mental clarity. These practices are particularly effective for calming the nervous system and fostering emotional balance.\nRegular physical activity not only improves physical health but also enhances self-esteem and body image. Achieving fitness goals, whether through strength training or aerobic exercise, provides a sense of accomplishment that can positively impact mental health. Over time, the physical changes from exercise, such as improved muscle tone and weight management, contribute to a more positive self-perception [5].\nReaching personal fitness milestones\u2014such as lifting heavier weights or completing a long-distance run\u2014boosts confidence and reinforces a sense of mastery over one\u2019s body. This sense of control and accomplishment helps individuals develop a stronger sense of self-worth, which is particularly beneficial for those experiencing anxiety, depression, or low self-esteem.\nAdditionally, regular exercise fosters a sense of resilience and perseverance, as individuals learn to push through physical and mental challenges. These qualities translate into other areas of life, empowering individuals to manage daily stressors with more confidence and emotional stability.\nTo experience the mental health benefits of exercise, individuals should aim to incorporate physical activity into their daily routines. This can include:\nAerobic exercise\u2014which includes activities like running, swimming, dancing, and cycling\u2014is one of the most effective ways to improve mental health. Regular aerobic activity boosts cardiovascular health and enhances cognitive function by increasing blood flow to the brain. This not only improves mood but also sharpens focus, memory, and cognitive performance [6].\nResearch has shown that aerobic exercise can significantly reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. By promoting the release of endorphins and other neurotransmitters, aerobic activities create a positive feedback loop that improves emotional regulation. Furthermore, aerobic exercise has been linked to better sleep, which is critical for maintaining emotional balance and reducing stress [7].\nStrength training, which includes weightlifting, bodyweight exercises, and resistance workouts, offers significant mental health benefits. Beyond physical strength, these exercises help develop emotional resilience and mental toughness. The focus and discipline required for strength training foster self-discipline and perseverance, traits that contribute to improved emotional regulation [8].\nStrength training is particularly effective for reducing symptoms of anxiety. Lifting weights and engaging in resistance exercises stimulate endorphin production, boosting mood and alleviating anxious thoughts. Additionally, strength training empowers individuals by providing a sense of control over their physical and emotional health, which can lead to greater self-confidence and reduced feelings of helplessness.\nExercise plays a critical role in supporting mental health by promoting endorphin release, regulating stress through cortisol reduction, and boosting self-esteem through goal achievement. Engaging in both aerobic exercise and strength training offers a holistic approach to emotion\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Try walking in place.\nFinding those small moments where you can get a few minutes of exercise in can be key to adopting a healthy lifestyle. You don\u2019t need to be a runner or even take a stroll around the block to chip away at getting 150 minutes of exercise a week.\nSo, how can walking in place help you reach your wellness goals? Exercise physiologist Jordan Boreman, MS, CES, explains why walking in place is an exercise that can work for anyone.\nYes, walking in place can be a great way to get exercise.\n\u201cAnything that gets you moving instead of just sitting or lying down is going to be beneficial for you in the long run,\u201d says Boreman. \u201cBy walking in place, you\u2019re raising your heart rate, which is going to signal to your body to start pumping more oxygen and blood to your muscles to help them move more efficiently, thus burning more calories.\u201d\nYou can walk in place almost anywhere. Think about walking in place while waiting in line at the store, cooking dinner, watching TV, talking on the phone or folding laundry. Get creative with the different places and ways you can walk in place.\nIn fact, walking in place for 30 minutes can burn about 100 to 200 calories.\n\u201cWalking in place is good exercise, especially for people who may have certain orthopaedic limitations,\u201d says Boreman. \u201cAnd you can go at your own pace with it, too.\u201d\nIt seems simple, right? All you\u2019re doing is walking in the same spot. But Boreman has a few tips so you get the most out of each step.\nWalking in place is a simple way to get exercise. Here are some of the other benefits:\n\u201cWalking in place is going to be convenient for people with a busy schedule,\u201d notes Boreman. \u201cIf you\u2019ve only got five to 10 minutes between the next meeting, doing a little bit of walking in place can improve your cardiovascular system and keep you energized for the next meeting.\u201d\nDon\u2019t just think about walking forward. Boreman says that walking in different planes of motion can offer some variety.\n\u201cEven adding a little weight that you can hold while you\u2019re walking can add a bit of resistance and variety to your workout,\u201d says Boreman.\nThe American College of Sports Medicine recommends getting at least two days a week of muscle-strengthening exercise, so adding weights to your routine would be beneficial for your overall health.\nYou can even do a few push-ups or crunches in between walking in place.\nIf you\u2019re trying to lose weight, walking in place can help, especially for fitness newbies.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very good for people who are just starting out,\u201d says Boreman. \u201cWalking in place is an exercise that\u2019s going to help you burn calories over a short time span.\u201d\nBut Boreman says factoring in diet and how often you exercise will play a role in the results you see.\n\u201cOver time, your body is going to get used to the exercise that you\u2019re doing,\u201d he notes. \u201cSo varying it up and increasing intensity as you go on can help with additional weight loss.\u201d\nTo keep walking in place fresh and fun, search for online videos and classes. \u201cDifferent classes use music with tempo that can help you keep pace along with instructors to guide you through the workout,\u201d adds Boreman.\nRegardless of how you walk in place, this easy form of exercise can be a good tool to have in your workout toolbox.\n\u201cIt\u2019s convenient, it\u2019s something that you don\u2019t have to travel anywhere to do it either,\u201d Boreman says.\nLearn more about our editorial process.\nAdvertisement\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

Whether you\u2019re looking to stay fit, boost your energy, or improve your overall well-being, there are plenty of ways to stay active and healthy right at home or outdoors. The best part? You don\u2019t need expensive equipment or a crowded gym to get started. Here are some practical and enjoyable ways to keep moving and take care of your body, no matter your age. If you\u2019re hesitant to try out a specific activity due to your health or physical constraint, make sure to consult a health professional at the clinic!\nOne of the simplest and most effective ways to stay active is to get outside. Fresh air and natural surroundings can boost your mood and help you stay consistent in your fitness routine.\nWalking: Walking is a low-impact exercise that\u2019s easy to incorporate into your daily routine. Whether it\u2019s a brisk walk around the block or a nature hike, walking helps improve cardiovascular health and strengthens your bones. Personally, this is the activity I use the most! I like to walk around my neighborhood listening to music/podcasts that I love, which makes it even more enjoyable!\nCycling: A great way to get your heart pumping while exploring your neighborhood or local parks. Cycling is gentle on the joints, making it an excellent choice for people of all ages.\nGardening: Believe it or not, gardening counts as a physical activity. Digging, planting, and weeding engage multiple muscle groups and can burn a surprising number of calories.\nYou don\u2019t need heavy weights or machines to build strength. Bodyweight exercises are a great way to strengthen muscles and improve endurance. Some effective bodyweight exercises include:\nSquats: A fantastic way to tone your legs and glutes. Try doing 2-3 sets of 10-15 squats daily.\nPush-ups: A simple exercise that works your chest, arms, and core. Modify them if needed by doing them on your knees or against a wall. 2-3 sets of 10-15 push-ups works well here as well.\nPlanks: Hold a plank position to engage your core. Start with 20-30 seconds and gradually increase as you build strength.\nThese exercises can be done anywhere, with no equipment necessary.\nFlexibility and mobility are often overlooked but are crucial for maintaining overall health, especially as we age. Stretching regularly can reduce the risk of injury, relieve muscle tension, and increase circulation.\nYoga: Yoga isn\u2019t just about flexibility; it also helps with strength, balance, and stress relief. There are many online resources or apps offering beginner yoga routines you can follow at home. YouTube is a great resource for follow-along videos for yoga routines.\nDaily Stretching: Incorporate simple stretches into your daily routine, focusing on your back, legs, and shoulders. Aim for 10-15 minutes in the morning or evening.\nDancing is not only fun but also a fantastic cardiovascular workout. You don\u2019t need to take formal dance classes\u2014just turn on your favorite music and start moving. Whether it\u2019s dancing around the living room, following along with an online dance routine, or taking a Zumba class, dancing improves coordination, boosts heart health, and lifts your mood.\nMany activities you already enjoy can double as a workout. Here are a few examples:\nPlaying Sports: If you love sports like tennis, swimming, or even golf, these can all provide excellent cardiovascular and strength benefits while having fun.\nPlaying with Pets: If you have a dog, take them for a daily walk, or play fetch in the yard. It\u2019s a great way to stay active without it feeling like exercise. I walk my dog throughout my neighborhood so it gives me even more motivation to get up and be active. It\u2019s hard to say no when your dog is begging you to go outside and walk!\nHousework and Cleaning: Vacuuming, sweeping, and scrubbing all involve physical activity. Turn up the music and get your heart rate going while keeping your home clean and organized.\nYou don\u2019t need to dedicate hours to a workout to stay healthy\u2014small movements throughout your day can add up. Some easy ways to increase your daily activity include:\nTaking the Stairs: Skip the elevator and take the stairs whenever possible. Climbing stairs is a great way to strengthen your legs and improve cardiovascular fitness.\nStanding More: Try standing while you work or watch TV. Invest in a standing desk or take frequent breaks to stand and stretch.\nActive Breaks: If you\u2019re working from home or sitting for long periods, set a timer every 30 minutes to remind yourself to get up and move. A quick stretch, a short walk around the house, or a few squats can help you stay active.\nYou don\u2019t need a gym to stay active and healthy. With a combination of outdoor activities, bodyweight exercises, and daily movement, you can create a fitness routine that fits your lifestyle. Focus on enjoying the process and finding activities that make you feel good. And remember, consistency is key\u2014small changes over time can lead to big results.

Familiarity memory refers to remembering an item as previously encountered, but without any recall ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nRecent models of hippocampal function emphasize the potential role of this brain structure in encoding and retrieving sequences of events that compose episodic memories. Here we show that hippocampal lesions produce a severe and selective impairment in the capacity of rats to remember the sequential ordering of a series of odors, despite an intact capacity to recognize odors that recently occurred. These findings support the hypothesis that hippocampal networks mediate associations between sequential events that constitute elements of an episodic memory.\nIn humans, hippocampal function underlies the ability to recall specific personal experiences1,2. Does this fundamental role of the hippocampus in human episodic memory extend to animals as well? Because animals cannot provide explicit reports of their experiences, this question is difficult to address experimentally. Some features of episodic memory may be assessed in animals, however, including the rich temporal, spatial and situational context of episodic memories3. In particular, recent theoretical analyses have emphasized the potential role of hippocampal circuitry in representing the sequential ordering of events that compose a unique behavioral episode4\u20137.\nHippocampal damage impairs memory for the order of a series of recently visited spatial locations8,9. Because the hippocampus is important to spatial learning and memory in a variety of protocols10, however, there has not been conclusive evidence for a role in sequence memory specifically. It has been suggested that recognition and working memory for nonspatial stimuli also depend on associating events across time11. Selective hippocampal damage, however, has only a modest12 or no13 impairment in recognition or working memory for nonspatial cues, even when animals are required to remember long lists of single stimuli14,15. Furthermore, several recent studies have suggested a distinction between the capacity to recollect the spatial and temporal context of episodic memories, mediated by the hippocampus, and a separate capacity to remember independent events based on the familiarity of recently experienced stimuli16\u201320. Here, we directly compared memory for sequential order of events with memory for prior occurrence of events independent of their order.\nTo test for sequential order memory, rats were presented with a series of five randomly selected odors. Memory for each series was subsequently probed in a single-choice test in which the animal was rewarded for selecting the odor that had appeared earlier in the series (Fig. 1). Sessions included six different types of probes in a random order. Before hippocampal surgery, rats required an average of 21\u201338 trials to reach a criterion of 80% correct over 10 consecutive trials on each type of probe. Subjects were then divided into two groups, a control group and a hippocampal lesion group, matched for average number of trials needed to reach criterion among the different probes. We report the ranges of average trial number \u00b1 s.e.m. for each group (control, 22.9 \u00b1 4.9 \u201331.9 \u00b1 7.8 trials per probe, n = 7; lesioned, 19.25 \u00b1 3.8 \u2013 37.9 \u00b1 9.9 trials per probe, n = 7; F1,14 = 0.056, P = 0.816).\nSequential order and recognition tasks. Top, sequence of events in each trial. Bottom, an example trial for the sequential order and recognition probes. A\u2013E designates the order of presentation for odors in each series, with odor A presented first and odor E presented last (see Methods). +, reinforced odor; \u2212, nonreinforced odor.\nPostoperatively, animals were tested for 15 trials on each probe, and scores on the last 10 trials were compared. Control rats performed well on all types of probes, whereas animals with hippocampal lesions performed at near-chance levels (Fig. 2). In addition, whereas performance on probe trials was dependent on the temporal separation (lag) between items during presentation of the series for both groups, rats with hippocampal damage were impaired at all lags (Table 1).\nPerformance (mean percent correct \u00b1 s.e.m.) of control rats and rats with hippocampal lesions on sequential order memory task. Rats with hippocampal lesions were reliably impaired (repeated-measures ANOVA, F1,12 = 39.609, P < 0.0001) and the severity of impairment did not vary reliably among the probe types (Group \u00d7 Probe interaction, F5,60 = 0.472, P = 0.795). Post-hoc tests revealed significant impairment on every type of probe (all t-tests > critical t12 = 2.119; *, P < 0.05). Controls performed significantly above chance on every probe (all one-sample t-tests > critical t6 = 2.447), whereas rats with hippocampal lesions performed better than chance only on the probe that involved the first versus the last odor in the sequence (t6 = 6.000; for all other probes, t < 2.447). Performances on different probes are grouped according to the lag (number of intervening elements) between items in the probe test.\nPerformance (mean percent correct \u00b1 s.e.m.) on sequential order judgments involving different lags.\nScores of each group were combined across lags of 1, 2 or 3 intervening elements between the two probed items (Fig. 1). In general, scores were higher for larger lags (F2,24 = 3.787, P = 0.037), indicating superior performance when probe items were more separated in the presentation series. Nevertheless, lesioned rats were significantly impaired overall (F1,12 = 23.769, P < 0.001) and at each lag (lag 3, t12 = 2.274, P = 0.042; lag 2, t12 = 3.412, P = 0.005; lag 1, t12 = 6.208, P < 0.0001), and the magnitude of the deficit did not differ between lags (F2,24 = 0.778, P = 0.471).\nWe also examined whether the animals had spatial biases that could have influenced their performance on this task and whether performance was dependent on the spatial positions of the probe items. Control and lesioned rats showed no preference, measured as the percentage of responses to each of six odor-presentation locations (contro\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This, together with the increase in crystalized intelligence and wisdom, is usually considered as a compensatory strategy. Research has demonstrated that physical activity might also act as a strategy and be one of the main factors that can slow down age-related perceptual and cognitive decline. Research also suggests that different types of physical exercise and sport lead to different changes in perceptual and cognitive skills as well as in several areas of the brain, especially those involving multiple domains, such as exergaming, dance or some sports. This review summarizes the findings of recent studies with older adults investigating the brain and cognitive benefits of different forms of physical exercise. Visuospatial attention, which plays a critical role in our daily lives, especially for older adults, is a central part of this analysis.\nThe purpose of the present review is to summarize previous and current findings related to changes in visuospatial attention as a function of age and physical exercise and sports activities (especially martial arts). First, we present a brief overview of the adaptation mechanisms used by older adults\u2019 brains, which involve functional and structural changes, to adjust to new demands. Second, we review the role of sport and physical exercise in the maintenance of visuospatial abilities that play an important role in well-being and healthy aging. Research with older adults, compared to younger people, could pose a number of challenges. It can be difficult to find older participants engaged in physical activity (PA), especially on a regular basis. Moreover, studies investigating visuospatial aspects such as peripheral vision or dynamic visual acuity in seniors are very scarce. In addition to cognitive and perceptual decline, older adults may suffer from ocular disease, refractive and oculo-motor decline or loss of visual skills. All these factors might contribute to the lack of research investigating PA and visuospatial attention in older adults. One of the main questions in the field of aging and PA concerns the type of exercise that might help to delay age-related cognitive and perceptual decline. This review examines and discusses the effects of aging on visuospatial attention and perceptual skills, and provides an overview of the potential beneficial effects of several types of physical exercise on brain and cognition. Finally, we look in particular at the effects of martial arts training (e.g., karate, judo, tai-chi) on aging and cognition. These topics are rarely dealt with in the area of PA and cognition in old age.\nSome cognitive processes, such as verbal abilities and implicit memory, do not decline with age [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. In fact, some factors, such as wisdom and procedural knowledge about how to act in certain situations, even improve with age [8]. Despite these positive results, aging is usually associated with the slowing down of processing speed [9, 10], a significant decline in working memory [7] and long-term memory [11], and difficulty inhibiting irrelevant stimuli [12]. Young and older adults show different brain activity when performing verbal working memory [13] and verbal long-term memory tasks [14, 15], possibly reflecting compensation maneuvers by seniors to obtain similar results as before. Older adults often have a tendency to engage both the left and right hemispheres [13], or even different areas than those used by young adults when performing the same task [7]. To account for these differences in cerebral functioning, Park and Reuter-Lorenz proposed the scaffolding theory [7, 16]. According to this theory, increased activation, especially in frontal areas, serves as a compensatory mechanism used by older adults to respond to the demands of certain cognitive tasks. However, it has been suggested [17] that such age-related neural dedifferentiation could contribute to rather than compensate for cognitive age-related declines, as the involvement of additional brain regions of older adults might in part be due to the decrease in neuronal selectivity, which would be a consequence of rather than compensation for cognitive decline.\nNeuroplasticity may also be considered as a compensatory mechanism. The brain is an adaptable organ, subject to a continuous learning process [18]. Neuroplasticity might modify the brain, both structurally and functionally, to respond to certain needs and demands [18, 19], reducing age-related slowing-down, and even delaying the onset of neurodegenerative diseases [20,21,22]. It is a learning phenomenon that occurs throughout the life cycle and that persists despite cognitive slowing, varying in its actions between individuals. In fact, large differences may be found as a function of life-style, with some older adults showing severe cognitive losses\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

    "input_prompt": "Claim:\nThe hippocampus is critical for forming and retaining new long-term memories.\n\nArticle Title:\nThe hippocampus and memory: insights from spatial processing\n\nGoogle Search Snippet:\nThe hippocampus appears to be crucial for long-term episodic memory, yet its precise role remains elusive.\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nRecent models of hippocampal function emphasize the potential role of this brain structure in encoding and retrieving sequences of events that compose episodic memories. Here we show that hippocampal lesions produce a severe and selective impairment in the capacity of rats to remember the sequential ordering of a series of odors, despite an intact capacity to recognize odors that recently occurred. These findings support the hypothesis that hippocampal networks mediate associations between sequential events that constitute elements of an episodic memory.\nIn humans, hippocampal function underlies the ability to recall specific personal experiences1,2. Does this fundamental role of the hippocampus in human episodic memory extend to animals as well? Because animals cannot provide explicit reports of their experiences, this question is difficult to address experimentally. Some features of episodic memory may be assessed in animals, however, including the rich temporal, spatial and situational context of episodic memories3. In particular, recent theoretical analyses have emphasized the potential role of hippocampal circuitry in representing the sequential ordering of events that compose a unique behavioral episode4\u20137.\nHippocampal damage impairs memory for the order of a series of recently visited spatial locations8,9. Because the hippocampus is important to spatial learning and memory in a variety of protocols10, however, there has not been conclusive evidence for a role in sequence memory specifically. It has been suggested that recognition and working memory for nonspatial stimuli also depend on associating events across time11. Selective hippocampal damage, however, has only a modest12 or no13 impairment in recognition or working memory for nonspatial cues, even when animals are required to remember long lists of single stimuli14,15. Furthermore, several recent studies have suggested a distinction between the capacity to recollect the spatial and temporal context of episodic memories, mediated by the hippocampus, and a separate capacity to remember independent events based on the familiarity of recently experienced stimuli16\u201320. Here, we directly compared memory for sequential order of events with memory for prior occurrence of events independent of their order.\nTo test for sequential order memory, rats were presented with a series of five randomly selected odors. Memory for each series was subsequently probed in a single-choice test in which the animal was rewarded for selecting the odor that had appeared earlier in the series (Fig. 1). Sessions included six different types of probes in a random order. Before hippocampal surgery, rats required an average of 21\u201338 trials to reach a criterion of 80% correct over 10 consecutive trials on each type of probe. Subjects were then divided into two groups, a control group and a hippocampal lesion group, matched for average number of trials needed to reach criterion among the different probes. We report the ranges of average trial number \u00b1 s.e.m. for each group (control, 22.9 \u00b1 4.9 \u201331.9 \u00b1 7.8 trials per probe, n = 7; lesioned, 19.25 \u00b1 3.8 \u2013 37.9 \u00b1 9.9 trials per probe, n = 7; F1,14 = 0.056, P = 0.816).\nSequential order and recognition tasks. Top, sequence of events in each trial. Bottom, an example trial for the sequential order and recognition probes. A\u2013E designates the order of presentation for odors in each series, with odor A presented first and odor E presented last (see Methods). +, reinforced odor; \u2212, nonreinforced odor.\nPostoperatively, animals were tested for 15 trials on each probe, and scores on the last 10 trials were compared. Control rats performed well on all types of probes, whereas animals with hippocampal lesions performed at near-chance levels (Fig. 2). In addition, whereas performance on probe trials was dependent on the temporal separation (lag) between items during presentation of the series for both groups, rats with hippocampal damage were impaired at all lags (Table 1).\nPerformance (mean percent correct \u00b1 s.e.m.) of control rats and rats with hippocampal lesions on sequential order memory task. Rats with hippocampal lesions were reliably impaired (repeated-measures ANOVA, F1,12 = 39.609, P < 0.0001) and the severity of impairment did not vary reliably among the probe types (Group \u00d7 Probe interaction, F5,60 = 0.472, P = 0.795). Post-hoc tests revealed significant impairment on every type of probe (all t-tests > critical t12 = 2.119; *, P < 0.05). Controls performed significantly above chance on every probe (all one-sample t-tests > critical t6 = 2.447), whereas rats with hippocampal lesions performed better than chance only on the probe that involved the first versus the last odor in the sequence (t6 = 6.000; for all other probes, t < 2.447). Performances on different probes are grouped according to the lag (number of intervening elements) between items in the probe test.\nPerformance (mean percent correct \u00b1 s.e.m.) on sequential order judgments involving different lags.\nScores of each group were combined across lags of 1, 2 or 3 intervening elements between the two probed items (Fig. 1). In general, scores were higher for larger lags (F2,24 = 3.787, P = 0.037), indicating superior performance when probe items were more separated in the presentation series. Nevertheless, lesioned rats were significantly impaired overall (F1,12 = 23.769, P < 0.001) and at each lag (lag 3, t12 = 2.274, P = 0.042; lag 2, t12 = 3.412, P = 0.005; lag 1, t12 = 6.208, P < 0.0001), and the magnitude of the deficit did not differ between lags (F2,24 = 0.778, P = 0.471).\nWe also examined whether the animals had spatial biases that could have influenced their performance on this task and whether performance was dependent on the spatial positions of the probe items. Control and lesioned rats showed no preference, measured as the percentage of responses to each of six odor-presentation locations (contro\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Engaging in regular physical activity contributes to emotional well-being, reduces stress, and enhances cognitive function. Through mechanisms such as endorphin release, stress reduction, and improved self-esteem, exercise provides a powerful, natural way to support mental health. Different forms of exercise, including aerobic exercise and strength training, can have profound impacts on both emotional and psychological well-being.\nOne of the key mental health benefits of exercise is its ability to trigger the release of endorphins, often referred to as the body\u2019s \u201cfeel-good\u201d chemicals. Endorphins are neurotransmitters that help alleviate pain and elevate mood, providing a natural remedy for feelings of anxiety, stress, and depression [1].\nWhen you engage in physical activity, especially intense exercise such as running or cycling, the brain releases higher levels of endorphins. This process leads to what is commonly known as a \u201crunner\u2019s high\u201d\u2014a euphoric feeling that boosts mood.\n\u00abBoecker and colleagues conducted a study to examine the effect of intense exercise (2 hours of running) in 10 trained male athletes (ages 33 to 40, with a minimum of 4 hours of weekly training for the past 2 years). Compared to rest, 30 minutes after running, mood (euphoria and happiness) was significantly enhanced\u00bb [2]\nOver time, regular physical activity can contribute to long-term mental health improvements by balancing emotions and reducing symptoms of depression.\nBeyond endorphins, exercise stimulates the production of other important neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine, which are associated with mood regulation and emotional well-being. By increasing the availability of these chemicals in the brain, exercise acts as a natural antidepressant, helping individuals manage their mental health more effectively [3].\nPhysical activity is also highly effective in reducing stress. Exercise lowers levels of cortisol, the hormone that is released in response to stress [3]. Elevated cortisol levels can lead to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues if left unchecked. By regulating cortisol production, exercise helps calm the mind and alleviate stress.\nEngaging in aerobic exercise such as running, swimming, or cycling increases oxygen flow to the brain, helping to release tension and clear the mind. These activities help lower cortisol levels and promote a sense of relaxation, allowing individuals to focus and manage their stress more effectively [4].\nIn addition to aerobic activities, exercises like yoga and Pilates also integrate mindfulness and deep breathing techniques that help reduce stress and promote mental clarity. These practices are particularly effective for calming the nervous system and fostering emotional balance.\nRegular physical activity not only improves physical health but also enhances self-esteem and body image. Achieving fitness goals, whether through strength training or aerobic exercise, provides a sense of accomplishment that can positively impact mental health. Over time, the physical changes from exercise, such as improved muscle tone and weight management, contribute to a more positive self-perception [5].\nReaching personal fitness milestones\u2014such as lifting heavier weights or completing a long-distance run\u2014boosts confidence and reinforces a sense of mastery over one\u2019s body. This sense of control and accomplishment helps individuals develop a stronger sense of self-worth, which is particularly beneficial for those experiencing anxiety, depression, or low self-esteem.\nAdditionally, regular exercise fosters a sense of resilience and perseverance, as individuals learn to push through physical and mental challenges. These qualities translate into other areas of life, empowering individuals to manage daily stressors with more confidence and emotional stability.\nTo experience the mental health benefits of exercise, individuals should aim to incorporate physical activity into their daily routines. This can include:\nAerobic exercise\u2014which includes activities like running, swimming, dancing, and cycling\u2014is one of the most effective ways to improve mental health. Regular aerobic activity boosts cardiovascular health and enhances cognitive function by increasing blood flow to the brain. This not only improves mood but also sharpens focus, memory, and cognitive performance [6].\nResearch has shown that aerobic exercise can significantly reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. By promoting the release of endorphins and other neurotransmitters, aerobic activities create a positive feedback loop that improves emotional regulation. Furthermore, aerobic exercise has been linked to better sleep, which is critical for maintaining emotional balance and reducing stress [7].\nStrength training, which includes weightlifting, bodyweight exercises, and resistance workouts, offers significant mental health benefits. Beyond physical strength, these exercises help develop emotional resilience and mental toughness. The focus and discipline required for strength training foster self-discipline and perseverance, traits that contribute to improved emotional regulation [8].\nStrength training is particularly effective for reducing symptoms of anxiety. Lifting weights and engaging in resistance exercises stimulate endorphin production, boosting mood and alleviating anxious thoughts. Additionally, strength training empowers individuals by providing a sense of control over their physical and emotional health, which can lead to greater self-confidence and reduced feelings of helplessness.\nExercise plays a critical role in supporting mental health by promoting endorphin release, regulating stress through cortisol reduction, and boosting self-esteem through goal achievement. Engaging in both aerobic exercise and strength training offers a holistic approach to emotion\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Research suggests that regular aerobic exercise increases the size of the brain region responsible for language memory and learning. Additionally, aerobic exercise may lessen inflammation and activate molecules that have an impact on the development and health of brain cells and blood vessels.\nStrength training\nStrength training isn\u2019t just for bodybuilders. According to a 2020 study in the journal NeuroImage,older persons who engage in six months of strength training are less likely to experience hippocampal shrinkage. Weightlifting or utilizing a resistance band can increase cognitive capacity, mood, focus, and decision-making skills in addition to strengthening bones and muscles.\nFlexibility training\nAs you get older, you may lose some of your flexibility. Increased flexibility means more energy, better posture, and a lower risk of injury. You may maintain your flexibility by doing yoga, stretching, and tai chi.\nDancing\nDancing not only improves brain function and boosts memory but also stimulates nerve growth factors. Dancing can activate and strengthen different brain regions.Additionally, dancing improves neural connectivity that increases growth factors in the brain. Numerous studies have also demonstrated that dancing is associated with a lower risk of dementia.\nDo you find it difficult to get started? If you have a tough time having a formal workout at the gym, you can do stretching, strength, and cardio exercise with your everyday housekeeping routine. Regular chores like mowing the grass, washing your car, or going for a walk to the store are all beneficial if you perform them with a moderate level of intensity.\nPhysical Activity for a Healthy Weight\nScientists Work Out How Exercise Saves Your Brain\nRegular Aerobic Exercise May Help Your Brain Age Better\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

But there are other reasons exercise ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nResponse Center: Stay informed about APA/APASI\u2019s response to recent federal policy changes affecting psychology\nIt\u2019s no secret that regular exercise promotes health throughout the body. Research shows routine physical activity can improve cardiovascular health, strengthen bones and muscles, and even reduce the risk of certain cancers. But did you know breaking a sweat can also strengthen the brain?\nA growing body of research suggests physical fitness is one way to boost brain health \u2014 and that a regular exercise routine can decrease the effects of stress on the body, improve mental health and mood, and even enhance memory and cognition.\nExposure to long-term stress can be toxic to multiple systems in the body, even leading to medical concerns like high blood pressure and a weakened immune system, along with mental illnesses like anxiety and depression.\nIt may seem counterintuitive that exercise, a form of physical stress, can help the body manage general stress levels. But the right kind of stress can actually make the body more resilient. Research shows that while exercise initially spikes the stress response in the body, people experience lower levels of stress hormones like cortisol and epinephrine after bouts of physical activity.\nSo far, there's little evidence for the popular theory that exercise causes a rush of endorphins. Rather, one line of research points to the less familiar neuromodulator norepinephrine, which may help the brain deal with stress more efficiently. Research in animals since the late 1980s has found that exercise increases brain concentrations of norepinephrine in brain regions involved in the body's stress response.\nNorepinephrine is particularly interesting to researchers because 50% of the brain's supply is produced in the locus coeruleus, a brain area that connects most of the brain regions involved in emotional and stress responses. The chemical is thought to play a major role in modulating the action of other, more prevalent neurotransmitters that play a direct role in the stress response.\nBiologically, exercise seems to give the body a chance to practice dealing with stress. It forces the body's physiological systems \u2014 all of which are involved in the stress response \u2014 to communicate much more closely than usual: The cardiovascular system communicates with the renal system, which communicates with the muscular system. And all of these are controlled by the central and sympathetic nervous systems, which also must communicate with each other. This workout of the body's communication system may be the true value of exercise; the more sedentary we get, the less efficient our bodies are in responding to stress.\nAlong with mitigating the negative effects of chronic stress on the mind and body, habitual exercise can improve mental health. Many experts believe routine exercise is as powerful in treating anxiety and mood disorders as antidepressants.\nPreliminary evidence suggests that physically active people have lower rates of anxiety and depression than sedentary people. But little work has focused on why that is. To determine how exercise might bring about its mental health benefits, some researchers are looking at possible links between exercise and brain chemicals associated with stress, anxiety and depression. One theory is that physical activity triggers a release of dopamine and serotonin, which can improve mood.\nBut there are other reasons exercise plays a crucial role in mental well-being.\nFor example, exercise can be particularly helpful for people who deal with anxiety and panic attacks. When you engage in strenuous physical activity, you're essentially mimicking the responses that can come with anxiety, allowing you to learn how to manage these responses and not be overwhelmed by them in other situations.\nPsychologists also recommend exercise to their patients because it leads to a sense of accomplishment. Getting dressed and driving to the gym first thing in the morning may not be so fun in the moment, but prioritizing self-care practices like exercise can result in a cascade effect of other healthy habits, like eating nutritiously, socializing with others and getting a good night's sleep \u2014 all of which can improve depression symptoms.\nFor even more impact on your mental health, combine your exercise routine with other evidence-based practices, like mindfulness meditation \u2014 or, reap the benefits of some good, old-fashioned fresh air and sunshine by taking a walk outdoors.\nHave you ever noticed that while your body might feel a bit fatigued, you feel more alert and energized after a bout of exercise? It's been proven that physical activity can improve brain functions like memory and cognition both immediately after a workout and in the long-term.\nIn research with rodents (rats and mice), there's evidence that exercise increases the blood supply to their brains and promotes the growth of new neurons (adult neurogenesis) in the hippocampus, a brain area that is essential for learning and memory. In one study, one group of rats got free access to a running wheel and another ran on a treadmill for an hour a day. After 30 days, both groups had a better blood supply to their brains. A group of sedentary rats showed no increase. An increased blood supply means increased oxygen and energy supply, and that equals better performance. The improvement in performance can also be attributed, at least in part, to an exercise-induced increase in adult hippocampal neurogenesis.\nAlthough these types of studies are only now beginning in humans, the theory is that because sports combine learning and exercise, they may both increase blood supply and enhance brain connections.\nRecent studies suggest physical activity benefits white and gray matter in the brain, which leads to enhancement of cognitive processes like thinking and memory, attention span, and perception.\nMovement can also improve cognitive regulation, or the ability to ignore distractions and multi-task.

Selective hippocampal damage, however, has only a modest12 or no13 impairment in recognition or working memory for nonspatial cues, even when animals are required to remember long lists of single stimuli14,15. Furthermore, several recent studies have suggested a distinction between the capacity to recollect the spatial and temporal context of episodic memories, mediated by the hippocampus, and a separate capacity to remember independent events based on the familiarity of recently experienced stimuli16\u201320. Here, we directly compared memory for sequential order of events with memory for prior occurrence of events independent of their order.\nTo test for sequential order memory, rats were presented with a series of five randomly selected odors. Memory for each series was subsequently probed in a single-choice test in which the animal was rewarded for selecting the odor that had appeared earlier in the series (Fig. 1).

Control rats performed well on all types of probes, whereas animals with hippocampal lesions performed at near-chance levels (Fig. 2). In addition, whereas performance on probe trials was dependent on the temporal separation (lag) between items during presentation of the series for both groups, rats with hippocampal damage were impaired at all lags (Table 1).\nPerformance (mean percent correct \u00b1 s.e.m.) of control rats and rats with hippocampal lesions on sequential order memory task. Rats with hippocampal lesions were reliably impaired (repeated-measures ANOVA, F1,12 = 39.609, P < 0.0001) and the severity of impairment did not vary reliably among the probe types (Group \u00d7 Probe interaction, F5,60 = 0.472, P = 0.795). Post-hoc tests revealed significant impairment on every type of probe (all t-tests > critical t12 = 2.119; *, P < 0.05). Controls performed significantly above chance on every probe (all one-sample t-tests > critical t6 = 2.447), whereas rats with hippocampal lesions performed better than chance only on the probe that involved the first versus the last odor in the sequence (t6 = 6.000; for all other probes, t < 2.447).

Nevertheless, lesioned rats were significantly impaired overall (F1,12 = 23.769, P < 0.001) and at each lag (lag 3, t12 = 2.274, P = 0.042; lag 2, t12 = 3.412, P = 0.005; lag 1, t12 = 6.208, P < 0.0001), and the magnitude of the deficit did not differ between lags (F2,24 = 0.778, P = 0.471).\nWe also examined whether the animals had spatial biases that could have influenced their performance on this task and whether performance was dependent on the spatial positions of the probe items.

The modern human brain is the largest and most complex of any living primate.\n\nFull Page Content:\nThoughts, memories, sensations \u2014 why are we still in the dark about how they work?\n04.21.2022\n10 min read\nShare:\nBy Rachel Tompa, Ph.D. / Allen Institute\nIs your brain like a computer? An old-timey telephone switchboard? A dense urban landscape?\nThese are all common analogies for the brain, but most who use them know they are wholly imperfect comparisons. We humans thrive on metaphor and succinct stories, but our brains themselves can\u2019t be summed up so easily.\nMany fields of science are complicated, and of course anything under active scientific investigation is not fully understood. But the brain seems different. Extra complex. Extra mysterious. (Although it could be partly our brains\u2019 own biases that tell us how special they are.)\n\u201cAn electron is complicated. But when it comes to the brain, that simple statement acquires a whole new resonance,\u201d said Allen Institute neuroscientist Stephen Smith, Ph.D. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated enough to somehow explain all the richness of the human experience as we know it: All of our feelings, all of our subjective experience, all of human history, human art, human science. Wars, love, greed. The brain is at the root of all those things. Is it appealing to think that a simple machine, easy to understand, could explain all those things? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\nScientists have known for centuries that the brain is the seat of human thought, but we\u2019re still in the dark about how it works. There are\u2026 a lot of reasons for that. I asked four neuroscientists to expound on why we don\u2019t yet understand the human brain, and what it might take to get there.\nLet\u2019s start with some stats. Your brain has 86 billion neurons, give or take \u2014 on the same order as the number of stars in the Milky Way. If you look at the synapses, the connections between neurons, the numbers start to get beyond comprehension pretty quickly. The number of synapses in the human brain is estimated to be nearly a quadrillion, or 1,000,000,000,000,000. And each individual synapse contains different molecular switches. If you want to think about the brain in terms of an electrical system, a single synapse is not equivalent to a transistor \u2014 it would be more like a thousand transistors.\nTo make things more complicated, not all neurons are created equal. Scientists still don\u2019t know how many different kinds of neurons we have, but it\u2019s likely in the hundreds. Synapses themselves aren\u2019t all the same either. And that\u2019s not even taking into account all the other cells in our brain. Besides neurons, our brains contain lots of blood vessels and a third class of brain cells known collectively as glia \u2014 many of which are even more poorly understood than neurons.\nScientists are making progress breaking those numbers down into something more comprehensible. At the level of individual brain cells, research teams at the Allen Institute and elsewhere are making headway into sorting the cells into different categories, defined as \u201ccell types,\u201d as well as being able to record electrical activity from living human neurons using creative new techniques.\nMany neuroscientists study the brain of the lab mouse, in part with the hopes of understanding basic principles of the mammalian brain that could apply to our brains too. There\u2019s a long history of rodent neuroscience, and here too, new techniques are opening a larger window onto the mouse\u2019s kumquat-sized brain. Some of these methods allow researchers to eavesdrop on the activity of hundreds to thousands of neurons in the mouse brain.\n\u201cThe concept of cell types as something tractable is fairly recent,\u201d said Saskia De Vries, Ph.D., an Allen Institute neuroscientist. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned a lot more about what the pieces are that make up the brain and how to access them. And now we\u2019re starting to enter a new challenge, which is that instead of recording single cells, we\u2019re now recording hundreds to thousands of cells at once. But a lot of our analytical techniques are still lagging behind. We\u2019re suddenly working with really large datasets that might require more advanced math to really delve into and make sense of.\u201d\nSmith and many other scientists believe that to fully understand the human brain, we also need to understand where it came from. The evolution of the human brain is probably just as much of a mystery as how it works in its current incarnation, and there are many teams of scientists working on this problem from multiple different angles.\nBut let\u2019s take an even longer view. Smith considers the synapse, the direct connection point between two neurons, as a catalytic event in the evolution of complex multicellular animals. What did we do before synapses evolved? Organisms still had ways to send signals between their cells, using diffusion of small molecules over relatively larger distances. (Synapses themselves involve diffusion of molecular signals, but it\u2019s a very directed and short diffusion through a tiny space between neurons known as the synaptic cleft.)\nBefore the evolution of the neuron and the synapse, which is thought to be more than 600 million years ago, animals still needed to sense their environments and react to changing circumstances, two major functions that our brains now orchestrate. They may have changed their behavior to find more food or evade dangerous situations more readily than their neighbors. The molecules that enabled this early learning \u2014 the molecules that diffuse from one cell to many other cells \u2014 still exist in our brains today. They\u2019re known as neuropeptides or neuromodulators, and while they\u2019ve been somewhat overlooked in favor of the more tractable synapse, Smith believes they could hold important clues about how our brains work.\n\u201cThere are hundreds of these molecules in our brains, hundreds of specific receptors for these molecules and very intricate networks connecting them. They\u2019re still there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s relatively easy to see a synapse if you have the right kind of microscope, but these other signals are more invisible. We missed a lo\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

And what\u2019s good for the body also benefits the brain.\n\"There is no surefire medical tool that can delay the onset of dementia and other memory problems,\" says Dr. Julie Brody Magid, Clinical Director of the Memory Disorders Assessment Clinic at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital. \"Certain drugs may help slow mental decline when symptoms arrive. But cardio exercise has consistently proved to help protect the brain from cognitive decline and perhaps even improve cognitive functioning if issues arise.\"\nHow does cardio boost your brain? There are many theories. Research has focused on how it can strengthen the heart, promote artery health, improve blood flow to the brain, fight inflammation, and increase key chemicals that encourage new brain cell growth.\nFor instance, cardio activates a molecule called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF helps repair brain cells and make new brain cells. It\u2019s also been associated with a larger hippocampus, the brain region that stores and retrieves memories.\nA study published online Aug. 20, 2021, by Nature Metabolism found that the hormone irisin, produced by muscles during exercise, protected mice against brain inflammation.\nThe study also suggested that increasing irisin through exercise may help counter the effects of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. (While this was only an animal study, the researchers speculated based on previous research that the effect could work with humans.)\nCardio exercise strengthens the heart and improves blood flow throughout the body, including to your brain, specifically its white matter. This helps protect against vascular dementia caused by reduced blood flow to the brain. Better blood flow also can clear toxins from the brain, further protecting against inflammation and promoting neurogenesis \u2014 the development of new brain cells.\nIt\u2019s never too late to adopt brain-protecting exercise, even if you show early signs of memory loss. A study published online March 23, 2021, by the Journal of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease looked at how cardio exercise affects people with early cognitive decline. Those who followed a yearlong moderate-to-vigorous cardio program scored better on cognitive tests than those who only did a stretching routine. Specifically, they improved their executive function skills, which involve planning and decision making. Most exercisers did brisk walking, but others did swimming, cycling, or ballroom dancing. They followed a 30-minute, three-day-a-week routine for six months and then increased it to five workouts per week.\nHow much cardio does your brain need? Research continues to explore this question, but it may depend on your fitness level. A 2015 study found that 20 minutes of moderate exercise produced the most significant cognitive boost for nonathletic people. Yet research in the January 2021 Journal of Sports Science found that 45 minutes was ideal for trained cyclists and triathletes.\nUntil more is known, aim for the recommended federal guidelines of at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise, five days a week, says Dr. Brody Magid. She suggests that you establish a regimen that is approved by your primary care physician and stick with it.\nAs for the best type of cardio, again there is no clear winner. However, challenging yourself is vital. \"Just like your body acclimates and doesn\u2019t get stronger when you do the same workout all the time, your brain also can get too comfortable with routine exercise,\" says Dr. Brody Magid.\nShe suggests mixing up your cardio workouts with varied intervals and trying new, challenging activities whenever possible. If you regularly walk, try swimming. If you cycle, try hiking. Also, consider cardio that includes mental stimulation and challenges. \"These offer a two-for-one combination of working your thinking skills while you work out your body,\" says Dr. Brody Magid.\nFor instance, non-contact boxing forces you to remember various sequences of punches, so you have to concentrate and stay focused. With racquet sports like tennis or pickleball, you to need to react to shots from an opponent and then plan and execute your return. \"The bottom line is that when it comes to the brain and exercise, any movement is better than none, and the more you move, the more you boost and protect your brain,\" says Dr. Brody Magid.\nMatthew Solan, Executive Editor, Harvard Men's Health Watch\nAs a service to our readers, Harvard Health Publishing provides access to our library of archived content.

Here are some of the other benefits:\n\u201cWalking in place is going to be convenient for people with a busy schedule,\u201d notes Boreman. \u201cIf you\u2019ve only got five to 10 minutes between the next meeting, doing a little bit of walking in place can improve your cardiovascular system and keep you energized for the next meeting.\u201d\nDon\u2019t just think about walking forward. Boreman says that walking in different planes of motion can offer some variety.\n\u201cEven adding a little weight that you can hold while you\u2019re walking can add a bit of resistance and variety to your workout,\u201d says Boreman.\nThe American College of Sports Medicine recommends getting at least two days a week of muscle-strengthening exercise, so adding weights to your routine would be beneficial for your overall health.\nYou can even do a few push-ups or crunches in between walking in place.\nIf you\u2019re trying to lose weight, walking in place can help, especially for fitness newbies.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very good for people who are just starting out,\u201d says Boreman. \u201cWalking in place is an exercise that\u2019s going to help you burn calories over a short time span.\u201d\nBut Boreman says factoring in diet and how often you exercise will play a role in the results you see.\n\u201cOver time, your body is going to get used to the exercise that you\u2019re doing,\u201d he notes. \u201cSo varying it up and increasing intensity as you go on can help with additional weight loss.\u201d\nTo keep walking in place fresh and fun, search for online videos and classes. \u201cDifferent classes use music with tempo that can help you keep pace along with instructors to guide you through the workout,\u201d adds Boreman.\nRegardless of how you walk in place, this easy form of exercise can be a good tool to have in your workout toolbox.\n\u201cIt\u2019s convenient, it\u2019s something that you don\u2019t have to travel anywhere to do it either,\u201d Boreman says.\nLearn more about our editorial process.\nAdvertisement\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

It benefits not only your bones and muscles but also your brain health. Exercise can help you think more clearly, learn new things, solve problems, and maintain emotional equilibrium. It also can improve memory and reduce anxiety or depression. For individuals who are at high risk for developing Alzheimer\u2019s and related dementias, regular physical activity may help reduce the risk of cognitive decline. Additionally, a new study shows that exercise can slow cognitive decline in sedentary older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).\nCDC researchers found that adults who are inactive had a nearly twice as high rate of cognitive decline as adults who are active. Therefore, the CDC has recommended a minimum of 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity physical activity for most adults. In this post, we will talk about how physical activity can affect brain health and will recommend some exercises that boost brain health.\nThe brain receives more blood when you exercise.\nExercise improves blood flow to the brain, supplying it with all the nutrients it needs to function properly. Physical activity also boosts the creation of chemicals vital to memory and other brain functions.\nExercise improves the capacity and strength of one\u2019s memory.\nExercise increases levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a molecule involved in the development of new synapses in the brain. This may help with the formation of long-term memories.\nExercise helps reduce anxiety and depression\nExercise can help decrease the number of stress receptors in the hippocampus, an area of the brain that is involved in emotions, learning, and memory. This may lessen the effects of stressful events.\nSince physical activity is so important for both physical and brain health. What type of exercise is the most ideal? Here are some recommended exercises that can boost brain health.\nAerobic exercise\nRegular aerobic exercise like running, swimming, or bicycling can not only enhance heart health but also promote the development of new brain cells and protect existing ones. Research suggests that regular aerobic exercise increases the size of the brain region responsible for language memory and learning. Additionally, aerobic exercise may lessen inflammation and activate molecules that have an impact on the development and health of brain cells and blood vessels.\nStrength training\nStrength training isn\u2019t just for bodybuilders. According to a 2020 study in the journal NeuroImage,older persons who engage in six months of strength training are less likely to experience hippocampal shrinkage. Weightlifting or utilizing a resistance band can increase cognitive capacity, mood, focus, and decision-making skills in addition to strengthening bones and muscles.\nFlexibility training\nAs you get older, you may lose some of your flexibility. Increased flexibility means more energy, better posture, and a lower risk of injury. You may maintain your flexibility by doing yoga, stretching, and tai chi.\nDancing\nDancing not only improves brain function and boosts memory but also stimulates nerve growth factors. Dancing can activate and strengthen different brain regions.Additionally, dancing improves neural connectivity that increases growth factors in the brain. Numerous studies have also demonstrated that dancing is associated with a lower risk of dementia.\nDo you find it difficult to get started? If you have a tough time having a formal workout at the gym, you can do stretching, strength, and cardio exercise with your everyday housekeeping routine. Regular chores like mowing the grass, washing your car, or going for a walk to the store are all beneficial if you perform them with a moderate level of intensity.\nPhysical Activity for a Healthy Weight\nScientists Work Out How Exercise Saves Your Brain\nRegular Aerobic Exercise May Help Your Brain Age Better\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This, together with the increase in crystalized intelligence and wisdom, is usually considered as a compensatory strategy. Research has demonstrated that physical activity might also act as a strategy and be one of the main factors that can slow down age-related perceptual and cognitive decline. Research also suggests that different types of physical exercise and sport lead to different changes in perceptual and cognitive skills as well as in several areas of the brain, especially those involving multiple domains, such as exergaming, dance or some sports. This review summarizes the findings of recent studies with older adults investigating the brain and cognitive benefits of different forms of physical exercise. Visuospatial attention, which plays a critical role in our daily lives, especially for older adults, is a central part of this analysis.\nThe purpose of the present review is to summarize previous and current findings related to changes in visuospatial attention as a function of age and physical exercise and sports activities (especially martial arts). First, we present a brief overview of the adaptation mechanisms used by older adults\u2019 brains, which involve functional and structural changes, to adjust to new demands. Second, we review the role of sport and physical exercise in the maintenance of visuospatial abilities that play an important role in well-being and healthy aging. Research with older adults, compared to younger people, could pose a number of challenges. It can be difficult to find older participants engaged in physical activity (PA), especially on a regular basis. Moreover, studies investigating visuospatial aspects such as peripheral vision or dynamic visual acuity in seniors are very scarce. In addition to cognitive and perceptual decline, older adults may suffer from ocular disease, refractive and oculo-motor decline or loss of visual skills. All these factors might contribute to the lack of research investigating PA and visuospatial attention in older adults. One of the main questions in the field of aging and PA concerns the type of exercise that might help to delay age-related cognitive and perceptual decline. This review examines and discusses the effects of aging on visuospatial attention and perceptual skills, and provides an overview of the potential beneficial effects of several types of physical exercise on brain and cognition. Finally, we look in particular at the effects of martial arts training (e.g., karate, judo, tai-chi) on aging and cognition. These topics are rarely dealt with in the area of PA and cognition in old age.\nSome cognitive processes, such as verbal abilities and implicit memory, do not decline with age [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. In fact, some factors, such as wisdom and procedural knowledge about how to act in certain situations, even improve with age [8]. Despite these positive results, aging is usually associated with the slowing down of processing speed [9, 10], a significant decline in working memory [7] and long-term memory [11], and difficulty inhibiting irrelevant stimuli [12]. Young and older adults show different brain activity when performing verbal working memory [13] and verbal long-term memory tasks [14, 15], possibly reflecting compensation maneuvers by seniors to obtain similar results as before. Older adults often have a tendency to engage both the left and right hemispheres [13], or even different areas than those used by young adults when performing the same task [7]. To account for these differences in cerebral functioning, Park and Reuter-Lorenz proposed the scaffolding theory [7, 16]. According to this theory, increased activation, especially in frontal areas, serves as a compensatory mechanism used by older adults to respond to the demands of certain cognitive tasks. However, it has been suggested [17] that such age-related neural dedifferentiation could contribute to rather than compensate for cognitive age-related declines, as the involvement of additional brain regions of older adults might in part be due to the decrease in neuronal selectivity, which would be a consequence of rather than compensation for cognitive decline.\nNeuroplasticity may also be considered as a compensatory mechanism. The brain is an adaptable organ, subject to a continuous learning process [18]. Neuroplasticity might modify the brain, both structurally and functionally, to respond to certain needs and demands [18, 19], reducing age-related slowing-down, and even delaying the onset of neurodegenerative diseases [20,21,22]. It is a learning phenomenon that occurs throughout the life cycle and that persists despite cognitive slowing, varying in its actions between individuals. In fact, large differences may be found as a function of life-style, with some older adults showing severe cognitive losses\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

There are\u2026 a lot of reasons for that. I asked four neuroscientists to expound on why we don\u2019t yet understand the human brain, and what it might take to get there.\nLet\u2019s start with some stats. Your brain has 86 billion neurons, give or take \u2014 on the same order as the number of stars in the Milky Way. If you look at the synapses, the connections between neurons, the numbers start to get beyond comprehension pretty quickly. The number of synapses in the human brain is estimated to be nearly a quadrillion, or 1,000,000,000,000,000. And each individual synapse contains different molecular switches. If you want to think about the brain in terms of an electrical system, a single synapse is not equivalent to a transistor \u2014 it would be more like a thousand transistors.\nTo make things more complicated, not all neurons are created equal. Scientists still don\u2019t know how many different kinds of neurons we have, but it\u2019s likely in the hundreds. Synapses themselves aren\u2019t all the same either. And that\u2019s not even taking into account all the other cells in our brain. Besides neurons, our brains contain lots of blood vessels and a third class of brain cells known collectively as glia \u2014 many of which are even more poorly understood than neurons.\nScientists are making progress breaking those numbers down into something more comprehensible. At the level of individual brain cells, research teams at the Allen Institute and elsewhere are making headway into sorting the cells into different categories, defined as \u201ccell types,\u201d as well as being able to record electrical activity from living human neurons using creative new techniques.\nMany neuroscientists study the brain of the lab mouse, in part with the hopes of understanding basic principles of the mammalian brain that could apply to our brains too. There\u2019s a long history of rodent neuroscience, and here too, new techniques are opening a larger window onto the mouse\u2019s kumquat-sized brain. Some of these methods allow researchers to eavesdrop on the activity of hundreds to thousands of neurons in the mouse brain.\n\u201cThe concept of cell types as something tractable is fairly recent,\u201d said Saskia De Vries, Ph.D., an Allen Institute neuroscientist. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned a lot more about what the pieces are that make up the brain and how to access them. And now we\u2019re starting to enter a new challenge, which is that instead of recording single cells, we\u2019re now recording hundreds to thousands of cells at once. But a lot of our analytical techniques are still lagging behind. We\u2019re suddenly working with really large datasets that might require more advanced math to really delve into and make sense of.\u201d\nSmith and many other scientists believe that to fully understand the human brain, we also need to understand where it came from. The evolution of the human brain is probably just as much of a mystery as how it works in its current incarnation, and there are many teams of scientists working on this problem from multiple different angles.\nBut let\u2019s take an even longer view. Smith considers the synapse, the direct connection point between two neurons, as a catalytic event in the evolution of complex multicellular animals. What did we do before synapses evolved? Organisms still had ways to send signals between their cells, using diffusion of small molecules over relatively larger distances.

The molecules that enabled this early learning \u2014 the molecules that diffuse from one cell to many other cells \u2014 still exist in our brains today.

Research has shown that it\u2019s important to get all three types: aerobic, muscle-strengthening, and balance.\nDoing one type of exercise can help improve your ability to do the others, and variety helps reduce boredom and risk of injury. There are also activities that incorporate multiple types of exercise, such as yoga, dancing, or water aerobics.\nFor workout videos and examples of how to do some of the exercises listed below, visit NIA\u2019s YouTube channel(link is external). No matter your age, you can find activities that meet your fitness level and needs and help improve your overall health!\nSometimes referred to as endurance or cardio, aerobic physical activity involves moving the body\u2019s large muscles for extended periods of time. This requires the lungs to move more air and the heart to pump more blood and deliver it to the working muscles. Aerobic physical activity increases your breathing and heart rate.\nBeing physically active in this way \u2014 with consistency over time \u2014 will improve your endurance and the health of your lungs, heart, and circulatory system. It can also help lower the risk of many diseases that are common in older adults, such as diabetes, certain cancers, and heart disease.\nGradually build up to at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (such as brisk walking) each week. If exercising with chronic conditions makes it hard to get the recommended amount of activity, talk with your doctor about what you can do. In general, it\u2019s a good idea to be as physically active as you can \u2014 even light-intensity movement can be beneficial. Try to be active throughout your day and avoid sitting for long periods of time.\nExamples of moderate-intensity activities that build endurance include:\nWhen you\u2019re being active, try talking. If you\u2019re breathing hard but can still have a conversation easily, it\u2019s likely moderate-intensity activity. If you can only say a few words before you have to take a breath, it\u2019s vigorous-intensity activity, such as running or jogging. Building up to 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity or doing a combination of both moderate- and vigorous-activity can also count toward your aerobic exercise goal.\nMuscle-strengthening exercises, sometimes called strength training or resistance training, are activities that require the muscles to contract, often to lift a heavy object against the pull of gravity. Gradual increases in the amount of weight, number of sets or repetitions, or the number of days a week of exercise will result in stronger muscles.\nMuscle-strengthening activities improve physical function and can help you stay independent and make it easier to perform everyday activities, such as getting up from a chair, climbing stairs, and carrying groceries. This type of exercise is also key to maintaining existing strength, slowing the loss of muscle mass, and helping to prevent falls and fall-related injuries.\nTry doing muscle-strengthening activities at least two days per week to work the major muscle groups of the body (muscles of the legs, hips, chest, back, abdomen, shoulders, and arms), but avoid working the same muscle group on any two days in a row to allow for muscle recovery between sessions.\nThe exercises should involve at least a moderate level of intensity or effort and be performed to the point at which it would be difficult to do another repetition. One set of eight to 12 repetitions of each exercise is effective, although two or three sets may be more effective. If you are a beginner, try exercises without weights or resistance bands (stretchy elastic bands that come in varying strengths) until you are comfortable with the movements.\nExamples of muscle-strengthening activities include:\nFlexibility is the ability of a joint to move through the full range of motion. Stretching can help maintain and improve flexibility. Moving more freely will also make it easier for you to exercise and perform activities of daily life, such as reaching down to tie your shoes or unloading the dishwasher. Stretch when your muscles are warmed up and after endurance or strength exercises, remember to breathe, and don\u2019t stretch so far that it hurts.\nBalance involves maintaining the body\u2019s stability while still or in motion. As with muscle-strengthening exercises, balance exercises help to prevent falls and fall-related injuries. Aim for about three sessions of balance exercises a week.\nExamples of balance exercises include:\nOlder adults need a mix of physical activities to stay healthy. As part of your weekly activity, include a combination of aerobic, muscle-strengthening, and balance activities.\nYou can also combine more than one type of exercise into the same exercise session. Activities such as dancing, yoga, tai chi, gardening, or sports can also be considered a combination because they often incorporate multiple types of physical activity.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention 800-232-4636 cdcinfo@cdc.gov(link sends email) www.cdc.gov\nMedlinePlus National Library of Medicine www.medlineplus.gov\nOffice of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (ODPHP) 240-453-8280 odphpinfo@hhs.gov(link sends email) https://odphp.health.gov\nNational Council on Aging 571-527-3900 www.ncoa.org(link is external)\nSilverSneakers 866-584-7389 www.silversneakers.com(link is external)\nYMCA 800-872-9622 www.ymca.net(link is external)\nThis content is provided by the NIH National Institute on Aging (NIA).

A psychometric approach shows unity and diversity in CC constructs, with 3 components in the most commonly studied constructs: general or common CC and components specific to mental set shifting and working memory updating. These constructs are considered against the cellular and systems neurobiology of PFC and what is known of its functional neuroanatomical or network organization based on lesioning, neurochemical, and neuroimaging approaches across species. CC is also considered in the context of motivation, as \u201ccool\u201d and \u201chot\u201d forms. Its Common CC component is shown to be distinct from general intelligence (g) and closely related to response inhibition. Impairments in CC are considered as possible causes of psychiatric symptoms and consequences of disorders. The relationships of CC with the general factor of psychopathology (p) and dimensional constructs such as impulsivity in large scale developmental and adult populations are considered, as well as implications for genetic studies and RDoC approaches to psychiatric classification.\nSubject terms: Cognitive control, Human behaviour, Psychiatric disorders\nMany psychiatric disorders and neurological conditions are associated with deficits in cognitive control (CC) and/or dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and its associated circuitry [1\u20134]. Consequently, there is a considerable premium on elucidating the basic psychological and neuronal mechanisms underlying the PFC\u2019s role within the neural networks that regulate behavior and cognition.\nCC is a term usually associated with the healthy functioning of the PFC and related regions such as the cingulate cortex [5]. Deriving from a cybernetic and cognitive neuroscience perspective, CC has often been considered synonymous with the earlier notion of executive function (EF), which has its roots in studies of clinical neuropsychology. In both cases, a core process of behavioral regulation is envisaged that optimises goal-directed behavior and counters automaticity. This process has many similarities with the distinction between controlled and automatic responding [6], which approximately aligns with the learning theory distinction between goal-directed and habitual responding [7]. One would expect the absence of CC to produce automatic behavior; controlled responding is goal-directed and flexible.\nMiller and Cohen (2001) [8] proposed that \u201c[CC] stems from the active maintenance of patterns of activity in the PFC that represent goals and the means to achieve them. They provide bias signals to other brain structures whose net effect is to guide the flow of activity along neural pathways that establish the proper mappings between inputs, internal states, and outputs needed to perform a given task\u201d (p. 167). This seminal account of the role of PFC in CC essentially consists of the contextual biasing of attention (for example, via instructions) to resolve conflicts and exert attentional control. The typical example is the much-used Stroop interference paradigm (see Fig. 1), in which participants are required to name the color (e.g., green) of the ink used to print words whose meaning is incongruent with that color (e.g, RED). The greater pre-potency of reading words over-reporting color causes interference, manifested as a slowing of decisional latency and activation of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) [9]. The conflict can be resolved by focusing attention on the color of the ink, associated with control (or bias) exerted by PFC regions. The theory was supported by an fMRI study showing that ACC activation was accompanied by activations of the dorsolateral (dl)PFC associated with top-down adjustments of response control [10]. Hence, in the simple model proposed by Miller and Cohen [8], the ACC detects conflict that is resolved by top-down biasing of response options from the dlPFC [9]. This theoretical scheme has provided one of the first demonstrations of a CC process to be mediated by specific, interactive PFC circuitry.\nWhen relevant, text above each schematic indicates different conditions, and text below indicates correct responses. The faces included in the emotional n-back illustration are taken from the NimStim set of models who have granted permission to publish their images in scientific journals [246].\nOne question to be considered here is whether CC is best considered as a unitary construct, a set of component processes, or a hybrid product of these extremes. If CC is best characterized as a set of distinct component processes, another question is how many of these can be identified and can they be further defined? The possible fractionation of CC can be related broadly to the heterogeneous nature of the PFC itself, which comprises, across species, many distinctive sub-regions, characterized by their cytoarchitectonic characteristics and by their connectivity with other brain regions. A related question then arises as to whether the PFC\u2019s role in CC is that of a unitary entity or \u201cmultiple demand\u201d (MD) system [11]. The MD system appeals to the enormous neural plasticity shown to be inherent within the PFC, so that the same neuronal ensembles can be recruited for superficially different tasks using \u201cadaptive coding\u201d [12\u201314]. However, an alternative viewpoint would be that the PFC sub-regions have somewhat different functions, potentially mediating the specific domains of CC. A more sophisticated version conceives specific PFC subregions of having multiple functions, as a consequence of the network-like nature of brain organization that has been revealed by brain imaging (see Haber et al., this issue, and Menon & D\u2019Esposito, this issue [15, 16]). \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This process has many similarities with the distinction between controlled and automatic responding [6], which approximately aligns with the learning theory distinction between goal-directed and habitual responding [7].
