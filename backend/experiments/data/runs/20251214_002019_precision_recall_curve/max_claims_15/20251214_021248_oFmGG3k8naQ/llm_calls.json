    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nhi everyone this is monty i've been doing some investigation into the floor nation of our uh water here in lebanon oregon and i got a letter from the harvard university they posted in the federal government's journal confirms that fluoride lowers iqs and that was on july 27 2012. you can you can most likely find it in uh just by typing in but you can see it's a major harvard university study that confirms that the fluorination of our city water lowers our children's iq now you would think that that would cause writing in the streets demanding that we would have fluoride removed from our water but ironically it doesn't another study this one done by harvard university on july 26th that says it was published in the national institute of health journal finds that fluoride lowers children's iq that's the florida nation of your city water and this is the article right here again it's a harvard university study now both of those were done in this year and you would think that as soon as the american people found out for sure through harvard university after they've done extensive studies that the fluoridation of our water supply causes our children redox retardation making our children's iqs lower causing problems and and families and health you think that people would uh be freaking out and getting the flu right out you think we wouldn't even have to ask our governments and our townships to remove the fluoride fluoride from our water they don't do it you have to fight tooth and now and chances are they're sterile aren't going to do it but if you're not worried about lowering iqs you know everybody says oh my kid's stupid you know we're used to hearing it but here's another release published in april 5th 2006 another one from harvard university studies shows a link between fluorinated water and bone cancer in boys so you know it just goes on and on it's just link after link all of these studies from harvard university uh not to mention the 3600 000 other studies that have been done by numerous people that just plagues this whole fluoridation of water and that people aren't doing anything about it they're not stopping it why is this being put in our water when it is causing the iqs of our children to be lowered causing uh all kinds of problems now here's a great thing me and my girl went to see her obgyn the other day and she had some work done on her while i was in the office i was talking to this specialist with women and children this lady is a doctor who specializes in child rearing and and women issues and stuff and i asked her what she knew about fluoride and she said that she strongly recommends that babies be fed special water that has been specially more foreign more fluorination put in the baby's water for the use of their uh for for their feedings and i asked her if she looked into it she said she felt some concerns about the recent stories of uh you know how fluoride is linked in in brain damage and she she said she hadn't really looked into it too much and i said well i just got you know i told her the story i just got this information on july 26 27th that uh from harvard saying that they definitely have confirmed it does lower uh children's iq and she said for years she'd been telling mothers of newborn babies to buy fluorinated water to feed their babies to put in their babies bottles so that their baby's teeth would be better and stronger well here's an interesting note the nurse that was helping this doctor says hey wait a minute uh i come from austin texas and they have natural fluorination of the water there where the water is over fluorinated and everybody in the town all the town of 300 000 people have white pitted stuff on their teeth and uh she said and everybody in the town acts literally like a bunch of dumbasses those are her words not mine she said that it's just a bunch of hooligans and everybody's kind of hillbilly mentality real low iq individuals and of course their waters naturally overflowed fluorinated it's called uh fluorination opmosis or something like that when you have too much fluorine in your body you get uh white spots on your teeth now here's just a thought if you know anybody with white spots on their teeth ask them a couple of simple questions and see if they're a dumbass because from what i hear from this nurse the people over in austin texas or somewhere around that uh all live in a town where the water has too much fluorine in it naturally and they're all a bunch of dumbasses uh hicks you know she this is her words not mine i i don't know i live in lebanon oregon and uh at any rate get sidetracked here there's all these studies out there saying that uh people who generally are angry and have gang-related problems and are fighting and are criminals usually have lower iqs people who are afraid when you become afraid your iq automatically goes down you lose a couple of points when you get really scared also when you get really angry you lose a couple of points you know it's briefly that's why people who get angry do stupid things what happens when you feed a baby from birth fluorinated water and they drink it their whole life haven't you noticed lately that our kids in america or just slightly not normal i have and i'm only 46 years old and i've noticed a huge decline in intelligence in our kids and i believe the world steady on children's iqs america's kids come in way under the mark like a hundred in the world our children that are being fed by by our country fluoride have the lowest iqs in in the world i mean there's a few countries that are lower in ours but i'm not even really sure there's anybody living there anyway these are just my views and they're backed with you know facts and i did talk to an ogbyn who said that she was recommending that babies drink specially high fluorinated water babies teeth fall out and they get new ones wouldn't it make more sense to wait until they were older to drink fluorinated water however fluoride isn't something that's brought in through the body system through digestion it's a topical thing if you go to a dentist the dentist puts it in a cup and sticks it on your teeth it's because it's absorbed through the teeth it's not absorbed through the body by drinking it and what what parts of it is is absorbed through it would require large amounts for it to do anything your teeth uh hence austin texas and then getting the white spots on their teeth look this stuff up it's on the internet i would like everybody to go and stop the fluorination of water and i think that we need to investigate how this stuff got put in and what is behind it now some people say well monty you're just a conspiracy theorist well that may very well be true but at least if i'm a conspiracy theorist then these people over in the harvard university need to be tarred and feathered because they're saying the same thing i am fluoride makes our children a bunch of retards anyways if you have any thoughts about this feel free to uh drop me a message also you know share this information and hit like on there and also uh subscribe thank you have a good day",

Fluoridation is effective, safe and benefits everyone regardless of age or income. About 3 out of 4 people in U.S. communities enjoy fluoridated water. So, until recently, questions about fluoride and IQ were rare.\nStudies conducted in New Zealand and Sweden showed that the IQ scores of adolescents and adults living in fluoridated communities during infancy and childhood were no different than the scores of people who lived in unfluoridated communities. These two studies are uniquely robust because they tracked IQ and other possible effects in large numbers of participants over a long period of time, well into adulthood.\nOpponents of fluoridation began focusing on IQ after the 2012 publication of a systematic review of 27 studies from around the world. Opponents claimed that this review showed that lower IQ scores in children were \u201ccaused\u201d by fluoride. There are many reasons why the evidence does not support this claim.\nIn recent years, opponents have focused on prenatal exposure to fluoride, with studies from Mexico City and Canada, where fluoride exposure is similar to U.S. and Canadian communities. These studies reported some differences in the IQ scores of 3 and 4 year olds related to the level of fluoride their mothers were exposed to. However, the Canadian study showed a significant difference only for boys \u2014 and only on one of the two tests.\nMany issues have been raised about the quality of the studies from Mexico City and Canada and, importantly, the results have not been confirmed by other research teams.\nThe Canadian studies are based on a single data set that was not designed to measure a mother\u2019s exposure to fluoride and how it might affect the IQ of offspring. This recently published analysis cites authoritative sources that dismiss the validity of both the measure of the individual mothers\u2019 exposures to fluoride and how the IQ of their children were tested.\nAny study of IQ differences must take into account the many factors that affect intelligence scores. Some of these include breastfeeding, nutrition, and mothers\u2019 IQ. Researchers work to account for these factors to increase confidence that a study\u2019s results are not skewed or otherwise affected.\nThe studies from Mexico City and Canada accounted for some but not all these factors. They relied on IQ testing that was conducted at only one age. By contrast, the New Zealand study tested IQ several times, starting at age 7 and ending at age 38. The fact that multiple test scores were collected, and over 31 year a period time, means that we can have more confidence in these results over others.\nIn 2015, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) initiated a review of studies on fluoride and possible effects on neurodevelopment. Before its publication in 2024, the NTP sought peer-review of its work, choosing the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. After performing two reviews, the National Academies concluded that the NTP had not identified \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence to support its initial claim that fluoride causes low IQ. As a result, the NTP had to remove its classification of fluoride as a \u201chazard\u201d.\nGoing one step further, the National Academies instructed the NTP to state very clearly that the studies it reviewed did not adequately examine exposure to low levels of fluoride, \u201cincluding those typically associated with drinking-water fluoridation.\u201d Although NTP\u2019s report found an association between high fluoride concentrations and lower IQ in children where fluoride levels exceeded WHO guidelines (1.5 mg/L), that is more than twice the 0.7 mg/L level of fluoridation in the U.S. and Canada.\nThe authors of the NTP report also publish a meta-analysis within which they acknowledged that three low-risk-of-bias studies on fluoride levels under 1.5 mg/L showed no association of fluoride with children\u2019s IQ. These findings are consistent with a meta-analysis conducted by other researchers who examined eight studies conducted in areas with water fluoridation comparable to the U.S., below 1.5 mg/L. They, too, found no association between fluoride exposure and IQ.\nNonetheless, publication of the meta-analysis spurred immediate criticism. Defects serious enough to call for retraction of the meta-analysis were enumerated in another such critique which concluded, \u201cWe further find major problems with the sources employed, including reliance on studies from non-MEDLINE indexed publications with an anti-fluoridation editorial stance, and major underlying issues with the data reported in several instances, indicative of impossible or unreliable data. Taylor et al is not reliable nor are its errors remediable. It should be retracted to avoid harms to public health and scientific discourse.\u201d\nIn 2021, a study from Spain agreed with the 2019 Canadian study that mothers\u2019 prenatal fluoride exposure was not associated with any difference in girls\u2019 IQ. However, it had an opposite finding regarding boys, finding higher cognitive scores in boys at age 4, not lower. A much larger 2022 study in Australia followed boys and girls with different lifetime fluoride exposures from birth to age 5. This study assessed the children\u2019s emotional and behavioral development later, before they reached age 18. Their conclusion? Exposure to fluoridated water during the first five years of life was not associated with altered measures of child emotional and behavioral development and executive functioning.\nMore than 7,000 studies and research papers have been conducted on fluoridation, and the overwhelming evidence demonstrates its safety and benefits. This enormous body of research and over 80 years of public health practice consistently point to the effectiveness and safety of fluoride use in the U.S.\nScience looks for patterns.

However, the Canadian study showed a significant difference only for boys \u2014 and only on one of the two tests.\nMany issues have been raised about the quality of the studies from Mexico City and Canada and, importantly, the results have not been confirmed by other research teams.\nThe Canadian studies are based on a single data set that was not designed to measure a mother\u2019s exposure to fluoride and how it might affect the IQ of offspring. This recently published analysis cites authoritative sources that dismiss the validity of both the measure of the individual mothers\u2019 exposures to fluoride and how the IQ of their children were tested.\nAny study of IQ differences must take into account the many factors that affect intelligence scores. Some of these include breastfeeding, nutrition, and mothers\u2019 IQ. Researchers work to account for these factors to increase confidence that a study\u2019s results are not skewed or otherwise affected.\nThe studies from Mexico City and Canada accounted for some but not all these factors. They relied on IQ testing that was conducted at only one age. By contrast, the New Zealand study tested IQ several times, starting at age 7 and ending at age 38. The fact that multiple test scores were collected, and over 31 year a period time, means that we can have more confidence in these results over others.\nIn 2015, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) initiated a review of studies on fluoride and possible effects on neurodevelopment.

Subgroup and sensitivity analyses also ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nBackground: Although fluoride may cause neurotoxicity in animal models and acute fluoride poisoning causes neurotoxicity in adults, very little is known of its effects on children's neurodevelopment.\nObjective: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies to investigate the effects of increased fluoride exposure and delayed neurobehavioral development.\nMethods: We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Water Resources Abstracts, and TOXNET databases through 2011 for eligible studies. We also searched the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database, because many studies on fluoride neurotoxicity have been published in Chinese journals only. In total, we identified 27 eligible epidemiological studies with high and reference exposures, end points of IQ scores, or related cognitive function measures with means and variances for the two exposure groups. Using random-effects models, we estimated the standardized mean difference between exposed and reference groups across all studies. We conducted sensitivity analyses restricted to studies using the same outcome assessment and having drinking-water fluoride as the only exposure. We performed the Cochran test for heterogeneity between studies, Begg's funnel plot, and Egger test to assess publication bias, and conducted meta-regressions to explore sources of variation in mean differences among the studies.\nResults: The standardized weighted mean difference in IQ score between exposed and reference populations was -0.45 (95% confidence interval: -0.56, -0.35) using a random-effects model. Thus, children in high-fluoride areas had significantly lower IQ scores than those who lived in low-fluoride areas. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses also indicated inverse associations, although the substantial heterogeneity did not appear to decrease.\nConclusions: The results support the possibility of an adverse effect of high fluoride exposure on children's neurodevelopment. Future research should include detailed individual-level information on prenatal exposure, neurobehavioral performance, and covariates for adjustment.\nPubMed Disclaimer\nThe authors declare they have no actual or potential competing financial interests.\nFigure 1\nFlow diagram of the meta-analysis.\nFigure 2\nRandom-effect standardized weighted mean difference\u2026\nFigure 3\nBegg\u2019s funnel plot showing individual\u2026\nNCBI Literature Resources\nMeSH PMC Bookshelf Disclaimer\nThe PubMed wordmark and PubMed logo are registered trademarks of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

Extremely high levels of fluoride are known to cause neurotoxicity in adults, and negative impacts on memory and learning have been reported in rodent studies, but little is known about the substance\u2019s impact on children\u2019s neurodevelopment. In a meta-analysis, researchers from Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) and China Medical University in Shenyang for the first time combined 27 studies and found strong indications that fluoride may adversely affect cognitive development in children. Based on the findings, the authors say that this risk should not be ignored, and that more research on fluoride\u2019s impact on the developing brain is warranted.\nThe study was published online in Environmental Health Perspectives on July 20, 2012.\nThe researchers conducted a systematic review of studies, almost all of which are from China where risks from fluoride are well-established. Fluoride is a naturally occurring substance in groundwater, and exposures to the chemical are increased in some parts of China. Virtually no human studies in this field have been conducted in the U.S., said lead author Anna Choi, research scientist in the Department of Environmental Health at HSPH.\nEven though many of the studies on children in China differed in many ways or were incomplete, the authors consider the data compilation and joint analysis an important first step in evaluating the potential risk. \u201cFor the first time we have been able to do a comprehensive meta-analysis that has the potential for helping us plan better studies. We want to make sure that cognitive development is considered as a possible target for fluoride toxicity,\u201d Choi said.\nChoi and senior author Philippe Grandjean, adjunct professor of environmental health at HSPH, and their colleagues collated the epidemiological studies of children exposed to fluoride from drinking water. The China National Knowledge Infrastructure database also was included to locate studies published in Chinese journals. They then analyzed possible associations with IQ measures in more than 8,000 children of school age; all but one study suggested that high fluoride content in water may negatively affect cognitive development.\nThe average loss in IQ was reported as a standardized weighted mean difference of 0.45, which would be approximately equivalent to seven IQ points for commonly used IQ scores with a standard deviation of 15.* Some studies suggested that even slightly increased fluoride exposure could be toxic to the brain. Thus, children in high-fluoride areas had significantly lower IQ scores than those who lived in low-fluoride areas. The children studied were up to 14 years of age, but the investigators speculate that any toxic effect on brain development may have happened earlier, and that the brain may not be fully capable of compensating for the toxicity.\n\u201cFluoride seems to fit in with lead, mercury, and other poisons that cause chemical brain drain,\u201d Grandjean says. \u201cThe effect of each toxicant may seem small, but the combined damage on a population scale can be serious, especially because the brain power of the next generation is crucial to all of us.\u201d\n* This sentence was updated on September 5, 2012.\nRead a September 2012 statement by the authors.\n** Learn more about the IQ measurements by HSPH\u2019s Anna L.

    "input_prompt": "Claim:\nFluoridation of water causes children's IQs to lower, leading to health problems.\n\nArticle Title:\nWhat to know about a controversial new study on fluoride and IQ\n\nGoogle Search Snippet:\nA new government study reviewing past research on the safety of fluoride for children found a slight decrease in IQ scores overall as levels of fluoride ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAmerica has been preventing tooth decay with fluoridated water for over 80 years. Fluoridation is effective, safe and benefits everyone regardless of age or income. About 3 out of 4 people in U.S. communities enjoy fluoridated water. So, until recently, questions about fluoride and IQ were rare.\nStudies conducted in New Zealand and Sweden showed that the IQ scores of adolescents and adults living in fluoridated communities during infancy and childhood were no different than the scores of people who lived in unfluoridated communities. These two studies are uniquely robust because they tracked IQ and other possible effects in large numbers of participants over a long period of time, well into adulthood.\nOpponents of fluoridation began focusing on IQ after the 2012 publication of a systematic review of 27 studies from around the world. Opponents claimed that this review showed that lower IQ scores in children were \u201ccaused\u201d by fluoride. There are many reasons why the evidence does not support this claim.\nIn recent years, opponents have focused on prenatal exposure to fluoride, with studies from Mexico City and Canada, where fluoride exposure is similar to U.S. and Canadian communities. These studies reported some differences in the IQ scores of 3 and 4 year olds related to the level of fluoride their mothers were exposed to. However, the Canadian study showed a significant difference only for boys \u2014 and only on one of the two tests.\nMany issues have been raised about the quality of the studies from Mexico City and Canada and, importantly, the results have not been confirmed by other research teams.\nThe Canadian studies are based on a single data set that was not designed to measure a mother\u2019s exposure to fluoride and how it might affect the IQ of offspring. This recently published analysis cites authoritative sources that dismiss the validity of both the measure of the individual mothers\u2019 exposures to fluoride and how the IQ of their children were tested.\nAny study of IQ differences must take into account the many factors that affect intelligence scores. Some of these include breastfeeding, nutrition, and mothers\u2019 IQ. Researchers work to account for these factors to increase confidence that a study\u2019s results are not skewed or otherwise affected.\nThe studies from Mexico City and Canada accounted for some but not all these factors. They relied on IQ testing that was conducted at only one age. By contrast, the New Zealand study tested IQ several times, starting at age 7 and ending at age 38. The fact that multiple test scores were collected, and over 31 year a period time, means that we can have more confidence in these results over others.\nIn 2015, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) initiated a review of studies on fluoride and possible effects on neurodevelopment. Before its publication in 2024, the NTP sought peer-review of its work, choosing the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. After performing two reviews, the National Academies concluded that the NTP had not identified \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence to support its initial claim that fluoride causes low IQ. As a result, the NTP had to remove its classification of fluoride as a \u201chazard\u201d.\nGoing one step further, the National Academies instructed the NTP to state very clearly that the studies it reviewed did not adequately examine exposure to low levels of fluoride, \u201cincluding those typically associated with drinking-water fluoridation.\u201d Although NTP\u2019s report found an association between high fluoride concentrations and lower IQ in children where fluoride levels exceeded WHO guidelines (1.5 mg/L), that is more than twice the 0.7 mg/L level of fluoridation in the U.S. and Canada.\nThe authors of the NTP report also publish a meta-analysis within which they acknowledged that three low-risk-of-bias studies on fluoride levels under 1.5 mg/L showed no association of fluoride with children\u2019s IQ. These findings are consistent with a meta-analysis conducted by other researchers who examined eight studies conducted in areas with water fluoridation comparable to the U.S., below 1.5 mg/L. They, too, found no association between fluoride exposure and IQ.\nNonetheless, publication of the meta-analysis spurred immediate criticism. Defects serious enough to call for retraction of the meta-analysis were enumerated in another such critique which concluded, \u201cWe further find major problems with the sources employed, including reliance on studies from non-MEDLINE indexed publications with an anti-fluoridation editorial stance, and major underlying issues with the data reported in several instances, indicative of impossible or unreliable data. Taylor et al is not reliable nor are its errors remediable. It should be retracted to avoid harms to public health and scientific discourse.\u201d\nIn 2021, a study from Spain agreed with the 2019 Canadian study that mothers\u2019 prenatal fluoride exposure was not associated with any difference in girls\u2019 IQ. However, it had an opposite finding regarding boys, finding higher cognitive scores in boys at age 4, not lower. A much larger 2022 study in Australia followed boys and girls with different lifetime fluoride exposures from birth to age 5. This study assessed the children\u2019s emotional and behavioral development later, before they reached age 18. Their conclusion? Exposure to fluoridated water during the first five years of life was not associated with altered measures of child emotional and behavioral development and executive functioning.\nMore than 7,000 studies and research papers have been conducted on fluoridation, and the overwhelming evidence demonstrates its safety and benefits. This enormous body of research and over 80 years of public health practice consistently point to the effectiveness and safety of fluoride use in the U.S.\nScience looks for patterns. The public is well-served when research \u2013 from process to data to analysis \u2013 is challenged through peer review and tested through replication. \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The research, ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nSince 1945, the use of fluoride has been a successful public health initiative for reducing dental cavities and improving general oral health of adults and children. There is a concern, however, that some pregnant women and children may be getting more fluoride than they need because they now get fluoride from many sources including treated public water, water-added foods and beverages, teas, toothpaste, floss, and mouthwash, and the combined total intake of fluoride may exceed safe amounts.\nTherefore, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) conducted a systematic review of the published scientific literature on the association between fluoride exposure and neurodevelopment and cognition. The NTP released their findings in a State of the Science Monograph (available below under Documents). A corresponding meta-analysis on children's IQ was published in JAMA Pediatrics on January 6, 2025 (see sidebar).\nThe NTP started this work in 2016. As with all research documents intended for publication, the NTP fluoride monograph and meta-analysis underwent rigorous scientific evaluation. The evaluation process has involved many steps. The draft fluoride monograph received critical feedback during peer-review by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM), from other external experts, and from experts in several federal health agencies. After modifications were made, additional evaluation following a rigorous scientific framework was conducted by subject matter experts organized by the NTP Board of Scientific Counselors. This document is now complete and available for reference.\nThe monograph represents a thorough review of the data, and the various interpretations of the data, to accurately reflect what we know and where additional research is needed.\nThe NTP monograph concluded, with moderate confidence, that higher levels of fluoride exposure, such as drinking water containing more than 1.5 milligrams of fluoride per liter, are associated with lower IQ in children. The NTP review was designed to evaluate total fluoride exposure from all sources and was not designed to evaluate the health effects of fluoridated drinking water alone. It is important to note that there were insufficient data to determine if the low fluoride level of 0.7 mg/L currently recommended for U.S. community water supplies has a negative effect on children\u2019s IQ. The NTP found no evidence that fluoride exposure had adverse effects on adult cognition.\nThe NTP uses 4 confidence levels - high, moderate, low, or very low - to characterize the strength of scientific evidence that associates a particular health outcome with an exposure. After evaluating studies published through October 2023, the NTP Monograph concluded there is moderate confidence in the scientific evidence that showed an association between higher levels of fluoride and lower IQ in children.\nThe determination about lower IQs in children was based primarily on epidemiology studies in non-U.S. countries such as Canada, China, India, Iran, Pakistan, and Mexico where some pregnant women, infants, and children received total fluoride exposure amounts higher than 1.5 mg fluoride/L of drinking water. The U.S. Public Health Service currently recommends 0.7 mg/L, and the World Health Organization has set a safe limit for fluoride in drinking water of 1.5 mg/L.\nAn association indicates a connection between fluoride and lower IQ; it does not prove a cause and effect. Many substances are healthy and beneficial when taken in small doses but may cause harm at high doses. More research is needed to better understand if there are health risks associated with low fluoride exposures. This NTP monograph may provide important information to regulatory agencies that set standards for the safe use of fluoride.

Fluoridation Facts \u2014 the Association\u2019s free resource on fluoridation that examines the mineral\u2019s effectiveness, safety, practice and cost-effectiveness \u2014 works to assist policymakers and the general public in making informed decisions about fluoridation. The new edition contains more than 400 references and 10 new Q&A\u2019s for a total of 69 covered over 114 pages.\nIn an ongoing series, the ADA News is delving into many questions explored in the book through conversations with experts about fluoridation information and misinformation \u2014 from overall effectiveness to whether ingesting fluoride impacts IQ, health and reproduction.\nCatherine Hayes, D.M.D., chair of the department of oral health policy and epidemiology at Harvard School of Dental Medicine, discussed whether fluoridated water causes osteosarcoma \u2014 question #33 in \"Fluoridation Facts.\"\nThe question of whether fluoridated water causes osteosarcoma, a form of bone cancer, gained traction in the 1990\u2019s when researchers, while looking at osteosarcoma, gave rats in a study exceptionally high levels of fluoride. While researchers considered the evidence to be equivocal, Dr. Hayes said, they did find a slightly higher incidence of bone cancer in those particular rats.\nAn exploratory analysis from 2006 found an increased risk for osteosarcoma in boys aged 7 exposed to fluoridated drinking water, but not consistently for girls, the ADA said. This prompted a case control study co-authored by Dr. Hayes that analyzed fluoride levels in bone samples from 137 human patients with primary osteosarcoma and bone samples from 51 patients with other malignant bone tumors who served as the control group.\n\u201cWhat was found is that there was no difference in bone fluoride concentrations in the people who had the osteosarcoma versus those who did not. And that was pretty significant because no one had really ever done that before,\u201d Dr. Hayes said.\nShe noted that researchers examined patients\u2019 residential histories and fluoride supplements. They conducted an analysis on individuals who lived in fluoridated communities versus those who did not, and found there was no difference in osteosarcoma risk. Dr. Hayes also added that osteosarcoma is already a very rare form of cancer.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence whatsoever to suggest that fluoridated water causes osteosarcoma. If it did, we would see much higher levels of osteosarcoma in the country,\u201d she said.\nFor more information on this free resource, visit ADA.org/FluoridationFacts.\nGame Changer: AI-Driven Matchmaking for Practice Transitions\nElevate your career, your life and your momentum with resources and benefits from the nation\u2019s leading dental association\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Of these investigations, 69 studies have found that elevated fluoride exposure is associated with reduced IQ in humans, while over 60 animal studies have found that fluoride exposure impairs the learning and/or memory capacity of animals. The human studies, which are based on IQ examinations of 26,142 children (67 studies) and 245 adults (2 studies), provide compelling evidence that fluoride exposure during the early years of life can damage a child\u2019s developing brain.\nAfter reviewing 27 of the human IQ studies, a team of Harvard scientists concluded that fluoride\u2019s effect on the young brain should now be a \u201chigh research priority.\u201d (Choi, et al 2012). Other reviewers have reached similar conclusions, including the prestigious National Research Council (NRC), and scientists in the Neurotoxicology Division of the Environmental Protection Agency (Mundy, et al). In the list of the IQ studies, we summarize the results from the 69 studies that have found associations between fluoride and reduced IQ and provide links to the abstracts or full-text copies, whe available, of the studies.\nFor a discussion of the 8 studies that did not find an association between fluoride and IQ, click here.\nIQ reductions have been significantly associated with fluoride levels of just 0.7 mg/L (Green 2019); 0.15 to 1.38 mg/L (Bashash 2017); 0.7 to 1.2 mg/L (Sudhir 2009); 0.88 mg/L among children with iodine deficiency. (Lin 1991); 0.50\u20131.90 mg/L (Yu 2021). Other studies have found IQ reductions at 1.4 ppm (Zhang 2015); 1.8 ppm (Xu 1994); 1.9 ppm (Xiang 2003a,b); 0.3-3.0 ppm (Ding 2011); 2.0 ppm (Yao 1996, 1997); 2.1 ppm (Das 2016); 2.1-3.2 ppm (An 1992); 2.2 ppm (Choi 2015); 2.3 ppm (Trivedi 2012); 2.38 ppm (Poureslami 2011); 2.4-3.5 ppm (Nagarajappa 2013); 2.45 ppm (Eswar 2011); 2.5 ppm (Seraj 2006); 2.5-3.5 ppm (Shivaprakash 2011); 2.85 ppm (Hong 2001); 2.97 ppm (Wang 2001, Yang 1994); 3.1 ppm (Seraj 2012); 3.15 ppm (Lu 2000); 3.94 ppm (Karimzade 2014); and 4.12 ppm (Zhao 1996).\nAbout a quarter of the IQ studies have provided data on the level of fluoride in the children\u2019s urine, with the majority of these studies reporting that the average urine fluoride level was below 3 mg/L. To put this level in perspective, a study from England found that 5.6% of the adult population in fluoridated areas have urinary fluoride levels exceeding 3 mg/L, and 1.1% have levels exceeding 4 mg/L. (Mansfield 1999). In Canada, Till et al (2018) performed a national survey of urinary fluoride levels of pregnant women in fluoridated and non-fluoridated communities. The fluoride levels of women living with water fluoridation had the same levels as found in the Bashash (2017) study. The U.S. has the same \u201coptimal concentration\u201d of 7 mg/L in their fluoridation schemes as Canada. Although there is an appalling absence of urinary fluoride data among children in the United States, the excess ingestion of fluoride toothpaste among some young children is almost certain to produce urinary fluoride levels that exceed 2 ppm in a portion of the child population.\nThe most recent IQ study from Yu et al. (June 2021) recorded these measurements for the 952 children in their study. The authors noted, \u201cOur study has several strengths. Using four fluoride exposure indicators including water fluoride, urinary fluoride, hair fluoride and nail fluoride, which reflect the external and internal, and short-term and long-term exposures, makes the evaluation of fluoride exposures more comprehensive and reliable. Besides, due to the relatively rare studies on low-to-moderate level fluoride exposure in hair and nail, our results also enrich the epidemiological evidence across different fluoride indicators and levels.\u201d\nIn the Mother-Offspring studies by Green 2019, Bashash 2017, Valdez Jim\u00e9nez 2017, and Li 2004, the authors evaluated the association of in utero exposure to fluoride on the offspring. Fluoride exposure was determined through urine analysis during the pregnancy and the levels were paired with cognitive testing of the offspring at various ages up to 12 years. Thomas et al. (2018) also performed this study finding an effect, however it is only available as an abstract, and it hasn\u2019t yet been added to the list of IQ studies.\nAs both the NRC and Harvard reviews have correctly pointed out, many of the fluoride/IQ studies have used relatively simple designs and have failed to adequately control for all of the factors that can impact a child\u2019s intelligence (e.g., parental education, socioeconomic status, lead and arsenic exposure). For several reasons, however, it is unlikely that these limitations can explain the association between fluoride and IQ.\nFirst, some of the fluoride/IQ studies have controlled for the key relevant factors, and significant associations between fluoride and reduced IQ were still observed. This fact was confirmed in the Harvard review, which reported that the association between fluoride and IQ remains significant when considering only those studies that controlled for certain key factors (e.g., arsenic, iodine, etc). Indeed, the four studies that controlled for the largest number of factors (Green 2019; Bashash 2017; Rocha Amador 2007; Xiang 2003a,b) reported some of the largest associations between fluoride and IQ to date.\nSecond, the association between fluoride and reduced IQ in children is predicted by, and entirely consistent with, a large body of other evidence. Other human studies, for example, have found associations between fluoride, cognition, and neurobehavior in ways consistent with fluoride being a neurotoxin. In addition, animal studies have repeatedly found that fluoride impairs the learning and memory capacity of rats under carefully controlled laboratory conditions. An even larger body of animal resear\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Of these investigations, 69 studies have found that elevated fluoride exposure is associated with reduced IQ in humans, while over 60 animal studies have found that fluoride exposure impairs the learning and/or memory capacity of animals. The human studies, which are based on IQ examinations of 26,142 children (67 studies) and 245 adults (2 studies), provide compelling evidence that fluoride exposure during the early years of life can damage a child\u2019s developing brain.\nAfter reviewing 27 of the human IQ studies, a team of Harvard scientists concluded that fluoride\u2019s effect on the young brain should now be a \u201chigh research priority.\u201d (Choi, et al 2012). Other reviewers have reached similar conclusions, including the prestigious National Research Council (NRC), and scientists in the Neurotoxicology Division of the Environmental Protection Agency (Mundy, et al). In the list of the IQ studies, we summarize the results from the 69 studies that have found associations between fluoride and reduced IQ and provide links to the abstracts or full-text copies, whe available, of the studies.\nFor a discussion of the 8 studies that did not find an association between fluoride and IQ, click here.\nIQ reductions have been significantly associated with fluoride levels of just 0.7 mg/L (Green 2019); 0.15 to 1.38 mg/L (Bashash 2017); 0.7 to 1.2 mg/L (Sudhir 2009); 0.88 mg/L among children with iodine deficiency. (Lin 1991); 0.50\u20131.90 mg/L (Yu 2021). Other studies have found IQ reductions at 1.4 ppm (Zhang 2015); 1.8 ppm (Xu 1994); 1.9 ppm (Xiang 2003a,b); 0.3-3.0 ppm (Ding 2011); 2.0 ppm (Yao 1996, 1997); 2.1 ppm (Das 2016); 2.1-3.2 ppm (An 1992); 2.2 ppm (Choi 2015); 2.3 ppm (Trivedi 2012); 2.38 ppm (Poureslami 2011); 2.4-3.5 ppm (Nagarajappa 2013); 2.45 ppm (Eswar 2011); 2.5 ppm (Seraj 2006); 2.5-3.5 ppm (Shivaprakash 2011); 2.85 ppm (Hong 2001); 2.97 ppm (Wang 2001, Yang 1994); 3.1 ppm (Seraj 2012); 3.15 ppm (Lu 2000); 3.94 ppm (Karimzade 2014); and 4.12 ppm (Zhao 1996).\nAbout a quarter of the IQ studies have provided data on the level of fluoride in the children\u2019s urine, with the majority of these studies reporting that the average urine fluoride level was below 3 mg/L. To put this level in perspective, a study from England found that 5.6% of the adult population in fluoridated areas have urinary fluoride levels exceeding 3 mg/L, and 1.1% have levels exceeding 4 mg/L. (Mansfield 1999). In Canada, Till et al (2018) performed a national survey of urinary fluoride levels of pregnant women in fluoridated and non-fluoridated communities. The fluoride levels of women living with water fluoridation had the same levels as found in the Bashash (2017) study. The U.S. has the same \u201coptimal concentration\u201d of 7 mg/L in their fluoridation schemes as Canada. Although there is an appalling absence of urinary fluoride data among children in the United States, the excess ingestion of fluoride toothpaste among some young children is almost certain to produce urinary fluoride levels that exceed 2 ppm in a portion of the child population.\nThe most recent IQ study from Yu et al. (June 2021) recorded these measurements for the 952 children in their study. The authors noted, \u201cOur study has several strengths. Using four fluoride exposure indicators including water fluoride, urinary fluoride, hair fluoride and nail fluoride, which reflect the external and internal, and short-term and long-term exposures, makes the evaluation of fluoride exposures more comprehensive and reliable. Besides, due to the relatively rare studies on low-to-moderate level fluoride exposure in hair and nail, our results also enrich the epidemiological evidence across different fluoride indicators and levels.\u201d\nIn the Mother-Offspring studies by Green 2019, Bashash 2017, Valdez Jim\u00e9nez 2017, and Li 2004, the authors evaluated the association of in utero exposure to fluoride on the offspring. Fluoride exposure was determined through urine analysis during the pregnancy and the levels were paired with cognitive testing of the offspring at various ages up to 12 years. Thomas et al. (2018) also performed this study finding an effect, however it is only available as an abstract, and it hasn\u2019t yet been added to the list of IQ studies.\nAs both the NRC and Harvard reviews have correctly pointed out, many of the fluoride/IQ studies have used relatively simple designs and have failed to adequately control for all of the factors that can impact a child\u2019s intelligence (e.g., parental education, socioeconomic status, lead and arsenic exposure). For several reasons, however, it is unlikely that these limitations can explain the association between fluoride and IQ.\nFirst, some of the fluoride/IQ studies have controlled for the key relevant factors, and significant associations between fluoride and reduced IQ were still observed. This fact was confirmed in the Harvard review, which reported that the association between fluoride and IQ remains significant when considering only those studies that controlled for certain key factors (e.g., arsenic, iodine, etc). Indeed, the four studies that controlled for the largest number of factors (Green 2019; Bashash 2017; Rocha Amador 2007; Xiang 2003a,b) reported some of the largest associations between fluoride and IQ to date.\nSecond, the association between fluoride and reduced IQ in children is predicted by, and entirely consistent with, a large body of other evidence. Other human studies, for example, have found associations between fluoride, cognition, and neurobehavior in ways consistent with fluoride being a neurotoxin. In addition, animal studies have repeatedly found that fluoride impairs the learning and memory capacity of rats under carefully controlled laboratory conditions. An even larger body of animal resear\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Who should ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nReviewed on 11/04/2025\nThe fluoride ion comes from the element fluorine. Fluoride, either applied topically to erupted teeth, or ingested orally (called systemic fluoride) during tooth development, helps to prevent tooth decay, strengthen tooth enamel, and reduce the harmful effects of plaque. Fluoride also makes the entire tooth structure more resistant to decay and promotes remineralization, which aids in repairing early decay before the damage is even visible.\nTopical Fluoride\nSystemic Fluoride\nOnce ingested, systemic fluoride is absorbed via the gastrointestinal tract and distributed and deposited throughout the body via the blood supply.\nIt is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry that children between the ages of 6 months and 16 years take in some form of fluoride every day. The most common sources are drinking water (not bottled water) and toothpastes that contain fluoride. If your child primarily drinks bottled water, talk with your dentist about using a product that contains fluoride. Your child's doctor or dentist will determine if your child is not receiving enough fluoride and may choose to prescribe fluoride supplements. These come either as drops or tablets that are taken by mouth. The amount of fluoride that is prescribed is based on the child's age and amount of fluoride in the drinking water.\nIn general, fluoride consumption is safe. Health risks associated with fluoridation are usually limited to misuse and over concentration. To avoid misuse and over concentration:\nChildren are especially vulnerable to dental fluorosis as their developing teeth are more sensitive to higher fluoride levels. Fluorosis only occurs in developing teeth, not those that have already erupted. Consult your child's doctor or dentist if you notice changes in the condition of your child's teeth.\nAppointments & Information\n1-800-879-2467\nFoundation\n267-426-5332\nResearch\n215-590-3800\nReferring Physicians\n1-800-879-2467\nBe among the first to know about our latest breakthroughs.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Of these investigations, 69 studies have found that elevated fluoride exposure is associated with reduced IQ in humans, while over 60 animal studies have found that fluoride exposure impairs the learning and/or memory capacity of animals. The human studies, which are based on IQ examinations of 26,142 children (67 studies) and 245 adults (2 studies), provide compelling evidence that fluoride exposure during the early years of life can damage a child\u2019s developing brain.\nAfter reviewing 27 of the human IQ studies, a team of Harvard scientists concluded that fluoride\u2019s effect on the young brain should now be a \u201chigh research priority.\u201d (Choi, et al 2012). Other reviewers have reached similar conclusions, including the prestigious National Research Council (NRC), and scientists in the Neurotoxicology Division of the Environmental Protection Agency (Mundy, et al). In the list of the IQ studies, we summarize the results from the 69 studies that have found associations between fluoride and reduced IQ and provide links to the abstracts or full-text copies, whe available, of the studies.\nFor a discussion of the 8 studies that did not find an association between fluoride and IQ, click here.\nIQ reductions have been significantly associated with fluoride levels of just 0.7 mg/L (Green 2019); 0.15 to 1.38 mg/L (Bashash 2017); 0.7 to 1.2 mg/L (Sudhir 2009); 0.88 mg/L among children with iodine deficiency. (Lin 1991); 0.50\u20131.90 mg/L (Yu 2021). Other studies have found IQ reductions at 1.4 ppm (Zhang 2015); 1.8 ppm (Xu 1994); 1.9 ppm (Xiang 2003a,b); 0.3-3.0 ppm (Ding 2011); 2.0 ppm (Yao 1996, 1997); 2.1 ppm (Das 2016); 2.1-3.2 ppm (An 1992); 2.2 ppm (Choi 2015); 2.3 ppm (Trivedi 2012); 2.38 ppm (Poureslami 2011); 2.4-3.5 ppm (Nagarajappa 2013); 2.45 ppm (Eswar 2011); 2.5 ppm (Seraj 2006); 2.5-3.5 ppm (Shivaprakash 2011); 2.85 ppm (Hong 2001); 2.97 ppm (Wang 2001, Yang 1994); 3.1 ppm (Seraj 2012); 3.15 ppm (Lu 2000); 3.94 ppm (Karimzade 2014); and 4.12 ppm (Zhao 1996).\nAbout a quarter of the IQ studies have provided data on the level of fluoride in the children\u2019s urine, with the majority of these studies reporting that the average urine fluoride level was below 3 mg/L. To put this level in perspective, a study from England found that 5.6% of the adult population in fluoridated areas have urinary fluoride levels exceeding 3 mg/L, and 1.1% have levels exceeding 4 mg/L. (Mansfield 1999). In Canada, Till et al (2018) performed a national survey of urinary fluoride levels of pregnant women in fluoridated and non-fluoridated communities. The fluoride levels of women living with water fluoridation had the same levels as found in the Bashash (2017) study. The U.S. has the same \u201coptimal concentration\u201d of 7 mg/L in their fluoridation schemes as Canada. Although there is an appalling absence of urinary fluoride data among children in the United States, the excess ingestion of fluoride toothpaste among some young children is almost certain to produce urinary fluoride levels that exceed 2 ppm in a portion of the child population.\nThe most recent IQ study from Yu et al. (June 2021) recorded these measurements for the 952 children in their study. The authors noted, \u201cOur study has several strengths. Using four fluoride exposure indicators including water fluoride, urinary fluoride, hair fluoride and nail fluoride, which reflect the external and internal, and short-term and long-term exposures, makes the evaluation of fluoride exposures more comprehensive and reliable. Besides, due to the relatively rare studies on low-to-moderate level fluoride exposure in hair and nail, our results also enrich the epidemiological evidence across different fluoride indicators and levels.\u201d\nIn the Mother-Offspring studies by Green 2019, Bashash 2017, Valdez Jim\u00e9nez 2017, and Li 2004, the authors evaluated the association of in utero exposure to fluoride on the offspring. Fluoride exposure was determined through urine analysis during the pregnancy and the levels were paired with cognitive testing of the offspring at various ages up to 12 years. Thomas et al. (2018) also performed this study finding an effect, however it is only available as an abstract, and it hasn\u2019t yet been added to the list of IQ studies.\nAs both the NRC and Harvard reviews have correctly pointed out, many of the fluoride/IQ studies have used relatively simple designs and have failed to adequately control for all of the factors that can impact a child\u2019s intelligence (e.g., parental education, socioeconomic status, lead and arsenic exposure). For several reasons, however, it is unlikely that these limitations can explain the association between fluoride and IQ.\nFirst, some of the fluoride/IQ studies have controlled for the key relevant factors, and significant associations between fluoride and reduced IQ were still observed. This fact was confirmed in the Harvard review, which reported that the association between fluoride and IQ remains significant when considering only those studies that controlled for certain key factors (e.g., arsenic, iodine, etc). Indeed, the four studies that controlled for the largest number of factors (Green 2019; Bashash 2017; Rocha Amador 2007; Xiang 2003a,b) reported some of the largest associations between fluoride and IQ to date.\nSecond, the association between fluoride and reduced IQ in children is predicted by, and entirely consistent with, a large body of other evidence. Other human studies, for example, have found associations between fluoride, cognition, and neurobehavior in ways consistent with fluoride being a neurotoxin. In addition, animal studies have repeatedly found that fluoride impairs the learning and memory capacity of rats under carefully controlled laboratory conditions. An even larger body of animal resear\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The new edition contains more than 400 references and 10 new Q&A\u2019s for a total of 69 covered over 114 pages.\nIn an ongoing series, the ADA News is delving into many questions explored in the book through conversations with experts about fluoridation information and misinformation \u2014 from overall effectiveness to whether ingesting fluoride impacts IQ, health and reproduction.\nCatherine Hayes, D.M.D., chair of the department of oral health policy and epidemiology at Harvard School of Dental Medicine, discussed whether fluoridated water causes osteosarcoma \u2014 question #33 in \"Fluoridation Facts.\"\nThe question of whether fluoridated water causes osteosarcoma, a form of bone cancer, gained traction in the 1990\u2019s when researchers, while looking at osteosarcoma, gave rats in a study exceptionally high levels of fluoride. While researchers considered the evidence to be equivocal, Dr. Hayes said, they did find a slightly higher incidence of bone cancer in those particular rats.\nAn exploratory analysis from 2006 found an increased risk for osteosarcoma in boys aged 7 exposed to fluoridated drinking water, but not consistently for girls, the ADA said. This prompted a case control study co-authored by Dr. Hayes that analyzed fluoride levels in bone samples from 137 human patients with primary osteosarcoma and bone samples from 51 patients with other malignant bone tumors who served as the control group.\n\u201cWhat was found is that there was no difference in bone fluoride concentrations in the people who had the osteosarcoma versus those who did not. And that was pretty significant because no one had really ever done that before,\u201d Dr. Hayes said.\nShe noted that researchers examined patients\u2019 residential histories and fluoride supplements. They conducted an analysis on individuals who lived in fluoridated communities versus those who did not, and found there was no difference in osteosarcoma risk. Dr. Hayes also added that osteosarcoma is already a very rare form of cancer.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence whatsoever to suggest that fluoridated water causes osteosarcoma. If it did, we would see much higher levels of osteosarcoma in the country,\u201d she said.\nFor more information on this free resource, visit ADA.org/FluoridationFacts.\nGame Changer: AI-Driven Matchmaking for Practice Transitions\nElevate your career, your life and your momentum with resources and benefits from the nation\u2019s leading dental association\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

You become so overwhelmed with information you can't make a decision. Your thinking and mind feel like slush and you make a bad decision.\nSharon Begley, in a recent Newsweek article \"I Can't Think,\" reports that with too much information, our decision-making is often worse. Smart people acting stupid! Where did their IQ points go? The \"brain freeze\" is an experience we have all had. Now with the research from brain neuroscience and using functional MRIs, we can actually understand these phenomena.\nWhen our thinking gets temporally impaired like these examples above, it is like we are operating with 10-15 fewer IQ points. The light goes out in the prefrontal cortex, which is our executive functioning and decision-making region of the brain.\nBrain Freeze\nImagine the fear, complexity, and seriousness of the decisions Japanese leaders needed to make in the wake of the earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear reactor dysfunction. It is easy to have \"information fatigue,\" while critical time lost is adding to the problems.\nWhen there is any fear or anxiety, the amygdala region of the brain, your emotional center, jumps to attention and takes resources away from the executive decision making of the prefrontal cortex. In a chain reaction, the light goes out on the prefrontal cortex, your IQ drains like a cold beer going down on a hot afternoon, and it easier to put off the decision, make a bad decision, or make no decision at all.\nMatthew Lieberman, a neuroscientist has found an inverse relationship between the activation of the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex. When the amygdala is active with blood and oxygen, there is less activation in the prefrontal cortex. Our thinking power is disrupted and there are deficits in our problem-solving because the blood and oxygen are in the amygdala versus the prefrontal cortex.\nLogic is suppressed by the powerful tunnel vision survival reaction of the amygdala. No one can make you do something against your better judgment, but the amygdala always can.\nAny strong emotion, fear, stress, anxiety, anger, joy, or betrayal trips off the amygdala and impairs the prefrontal cortex's working memory. The power of emotions overwhelms rationality. That is why when we are emotionally upset or stressed we can't think straight. The IQ points we need to thoughtfully consider decisions are depleted temporarily.\nNew brain science research from Srinivasan Pillay's new book, Your Brain and Business, reports that even information heard and not consciously registered can activate the amygdala region. The TV in the background giving the latest reports of the Japanese tragedy creates a fear response if heard for 10-30 milliseconds so fast that you can't register it. The brain needs 30 milliseconds for the brain to consciously pick it up. So that unconscious fear and anxiety residing in the amygdala can be blocking critical IQ and decision making resources without you knowing it.\nNow any decision you make today can be complicated and overwhelming when you add websites to check out, friends on Facebook or Twitter's opinions, and the multiple and different reviews. The easiest thing is to put off this decision till you have more energy. Your brain resources to make great decisions are spent.\nIf your multitude of decision considerations are in conflict it also activates the Anterior Cingulate Cortex of the brain which deals with conflict. It then quickly connects to the amygdala and keeps it activated and your IQ in a brain freeze.\nHow to Counteract the Brain Freeze and Gain back your IQ Points?\n1. Give your brain a recess. Think of young kids in school, when the bell rings for recess. They yell and scream with free time. Your mind needs a recess to wander in an unstructured manner. Often in this recess, an idea or solution may emerge to an issue you have been dealing with.\n2. Turn off the TV or radio if you aren't consciously wanting to get news or entertainment. This is so you don't burn critical brain resources by stimulating a fear response without knowing it.\n3. Seed your unconscious. Give your unconscious instructions to work on an issue in the background as you focus on something else.\n4. Clear the deck. Focus on something else for a while or talk to a friend who is positive to change your sense of overwhelm. Allow the prefrontal cortex and your working memory to recharge.\n5. Practice a mindfulness exercise. Focus on your breathing or really stay focused on what you are doing in the moment. Feel your body in space as you sit or move. Meditation, yoga, walking or a massage are ways to allow the prefrontal cortex to recharge gain your IQ points back.\nRead the next post for how you can lose IQ points with anger outbursts.\nFor more information and resources, go to truenorthleadership.com.\nContact: Rnadler@truenorthleadership.com\nCopyright (2011) Relly Nadler, Psy.D.\nRelly Nadler, M.C.C., is a licensed psychologist, author and Master Certified Coach (MCC) for executives and executive teams.\nGet the help you need from a therapist near you\u2013a FREE service from Psychology Today.\nPsychology Today \u00a9 2025 Sussex Publishers, LLC\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Loc Do, Ph.D., co-author of the study, said factors that could impact the relationship between fluoride and IQ, such as socioeconomic status, were taken into account when determining the results.\nHe added that while there are claims water fluoridation can negatively affect children\u2019s neurodevelopment, \u201cthese results provide consistent evidence this is not the case.\u201d\n\u201cThis population-based follow-up study has provided consistent scientific evidence that early-life exposure to fluoride was not negatively associated with cognitive neurodevelopment. The findings, in combination with the current body of knowledge, provide assurance that the currently practiced [water fluoridation] programs are both effective and safe for young children,\u201d the study concludes.\nIn Australia, 89% of the population served by community water systems benefit from water fluoridated at 0.6- 1.1 mg/L. Research from studies such as the National Child Oral Health Study and Environmental Research\u2019s systematic review of water fluoridation in Australia have shown that fluoride decrease the rate of tooth decay by 26-44% in adults and children.\nThis new research is currently being reviewed by the National Fluoridation Advisory Committee, the ADA\u2019s standing panel of experts that provide advice about the safety and effectiveness of fluoride.\nThe ADA has continually advocated for community water fluoridation, highlighting the mineral\u2019s proven effectiveness in preventing tooth decay. For more than 75 years strong scientific evidence has consistently shown that fluoride is safe and beneficial, according to the ADA.\nJayanth Kumar, D.D.S., former California state dental director and National Fluoridation Advisory Committee member, said the follow-up study provided additional scientific evidence that early-life exposure to fluoride is not negatively associated with brain development.\n\u201cThe findings add to the growing body of evidence from more than a dozen studies showing that fluoride concentration relevant to community water fluoridation is safe,\u201d he said.\nFor more information on community water fluoridation, visit ADA.org/fluoride.\nGame Changer: AI-Driven Matchmaking for Practice Transitions\nElevate your career, your life and your momentum with resources and benefits from the nation\u2019s leading dental association\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

It represents a multifaceted construct that involves both our ability to reason and our ability to understand emotions (Gardner, 2008).\nIQ, or intellectual quotient, is our ability to think logically, comprehend and assimilate new information, and problem-solve. Individuals with high IQs can easily make connections between abstract concepts to aid generalizations, and they can apply knowledge to a range of skill sets.\nEQ, or emotional quotient, refers to our ability to recognize and manage our own emotions and the emotions of others (Goleman, 1996).\nUnderstanding how emotions drive our behaviors is crucial, allowing us to develop greater self-awareness, adopt more functional responses to our environment, and develop more empathetic relationships with others.\nIn This Article:\nSome key functions and skills of EQ include:\nIn comparison, some of the key functions and skills of IQ include:\nBoth EQ and IQ are important forms of intelligence that help people succeed in their personal and professional lives. However, there are some key differences between the two constructs (Figure 1).\nThe main difference is that EQ involves the ability to recognize, understand, and manage emotions effectively, while IQ focuses purely on cognitive intelligence and academic problem-solving abilities.\nAt one point in time, IQ was considered the prime determinant of success in life. The book \u201cEmotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ\u201d was written by Daniel Goleman and was first published in 1995. It played a significant role in popularizing the concept of emotional intelligence in the mainstream.\nAccording to the author, people with well-developed emotional skills are \u201cmore likely to be content and effective in their lives, mastering the habits of the mind that foster their own productivity\u201d, while people who lack control over their emotional life \u201cfight battles that sabotage their ability for focussed work and clear thought\u201d (Goleman, 1996).\nSince then, emotional intelligence (EI) has been extensively researched and linked to positive life outcomes, including job success (Papoutsi, Drigas, and Skianis, 2019), relationship satisfaction (Malouff, Schutte and Thorsteinsson, 2014) and stress tolerance (Lea et al., 2019).\nDue to its trainability, EI has also been considered an important skill to develop in school environments, and there is now a growing demand for teachers to implement behaviors informed by EI principles in classrooms (Mortiboys, 2013).\nAt the same time, a new body of research recognized an overemphasis on the benefits of EI, which in some individuals can lead to an excessive focus on emotions and hinder performance in high-pressure situations.\nFor example, a study showed how individuals with greater sensitivity to emotions had greater difficulty delivering a speech in front of judges assessing their performance (Bechtoldt and Schneider, 2016).\nIn some situations, an excess of EI can also impact the consideration of rational aspects in decision-making or result in increased susceptibility to others\u2019 negative emotional states (Chamorro-Premuzic and Yearsley, 2017).\nAdditional studies highlighted how cognitive ability remains the most significant predictor of performance in jobs requiring the adoption of analytical and technical skills, like engineering, accounting, or science.\nBy contrast, EI appears more relevant in jobs that involve more direct interactions with people, such as sales, real estate, and counseling (Grant, 2014).\nIn school environments, it has been recognized that high intelligence and a conscientious personality are the most important psychological traits associated with academic success, while emotional intelligence represents a third significant factor (MacCann et al., 2020).\nOverall, it seems that IQ and EQ are important to different degrees in relation to the contexts in which they are applied.\nNurturing both aspects of intelligence, making them operate in harmony with each other, can help us lead a balanced life where both cognitive abilities and emotional well-being are prioritized.\nIt is recognized that traditional intelligence (IQ) supports critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are crucial in determining employees\u2019 adaptability to a work environment.

The new edition contains more than 400 references and 10 new Q&A\u2019s for a total of 69 questions answered over 114 pages.\nIn an ongoing series, the ADA News is delving into many questions explored in the book through conversations with experts about fluoridation information and misinformation \u2014 from overall effectiveness to whether ingesting fluoride impacts IQ, health and reproduction.\nSteven Levy, D.D.S., University of Iowa dental professor and international expert on fluoride intake, discussed the safety of using fluoridated water to reconstitute infant formula \u2014 question No. 28 in \u201cFluoridation Facts.\u201d\nDr. Levy said evidence continues to support the safety of using community-fluoridated water to reconstitute infant formula, while acknowledging a small associated risk of mild dental fluorosis, which is a change in the appearance of tooth enamel that occurs only while teeth are developing. Mild forms present as faint white spots or streaks and do not affect tooth function. Moderate and severe fluorosis \u2014 which can involve staining or pitting \u2014 occur only with fluoride levels far above those used in community water fluoridation, he said.\nDr. Levy emphasized that research has long shown the benefits of water at about 1 part per million of fluoride, noting that high-fluoride water, or 2 to 3 ppm or more, is linked with more severe forms of fluorosis, while optimally fluoridated water provides substantial cavity prevention with minimal cosmetic risk.\n\u201cWe generally recommend that it is okay for most parents to use fluoridated water with their infants, including when they reconstitute infant formula,\u201d Dr. Levy said.\nInfants who consume large volumes of powdered formula reconstituted with fluoridated water may ingest more fluoride than is ideal for their age, which can slightly increase the likelihood of mild fluorosis. However, Dr. Levy noted that online discussions often misrepresent and exaggerate the issue when opponents display images of advanced fluorosis as if they were typical.\nDr. Levy reiterated that fluoridated water remains appropriate for most families. For parents who are particularly concerned about even mild fluorosis, he said clinicians may recommend the optional use of lower-fluoride or fluoride-free water for formula preparation.\n\u201cWe generally recommend that dentists and physicians feel comfortable recommending their patients use fluoridated water, but if there is concern expressed, then that\u2019s where you would recommend lower fluoride water,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it\u2019s just an occasional bottle for four ounces once or twice a day or something, then that\u2019s where you probably wouldn\u2019t bother with it. But if it\u2019s a frequent regular thing, and they\u2019re getting larger quantities, then it\u2019s really good to consider doing that.\u201d\nGame Changer: AI-Driven Matchmaking for Practice Transitions\nElevate your career, your life and your momentum with resources and benefits from the nation\u2019s leading dental association\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Has there indeed been such tests or anything else about testing IQ levels of different moods for the same subject?\nThe first question that should be asked is, do you mean cognitive ability or IQ? They are intertwined, but different. Unfortunately, I can not comment. I'm going to answer based on the question in the title.\nYes. Walter Mischels work on self-control indicates that anger, a \"hot\" emotion led by the amygdala in the limbic system, will provoke more immediate response. Limiting cognitive abilities like working memory, judgment and evaluation, reasoning and \"computation\", decision making, and comprehension.\nThe limbic system consists of primitive brain structures located under the cortex on top of the brain stem, which developed early in our evolution. These structures regulate basic drives and emotions essential for survival, from fear and anger to hunger and sex... Within the limbic system, the amygdala is especially important. It plays a key role in fear responses and in sexual and appetitive behavior. The amygdala rapidly mobilizes the body for action. It does not pause to think and reflect or worry about long term consequences. (Pg 43)\nThe hot system is ... Reflexive, simple, emotional, it automatically and quickly triggers consumptive behavior, arousal, and impulsive action (Pg 44-45)\nThis hot response is not useful when success in a given situation depends on staying cool, planning ahead, and problem-solving rationally. (Pg 45)\n(Emphasis mine)\nThe \"cool\" cognitive system, where we find our cognitive abilities.\nClosely interconnected with the brain's hot system is its cool system, which is cognitive, complex, reflective, and slower to activate. It is centered primarily in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). It's important to note that stress attenuates the cool system and accentuates the hot system. The hot and cool systems continuously and seamlessly interact in a reciprocal relationship: as one becomes more active the other becomes less active. (Pg 46)\nThe PFC is the most evolved region of the brain. It enables and supports the highest-order cognitive abilities that make us distinctly human. ...Unlike the hot system, the cool system is attuned to the informational aspects of stimuli and enables rational, reflective, and strategic behavior. (Pg 46)\nHere we have a pretty clear description of how anger, \"hot\", limits the cognitive abilities of the prefrontal cortex, or the \"cold\" system.\nFinally,\nProlonged stress impairs the PFC, which is essential... for things like surviving high school, holding down a job, pursuing an advanced degree... and refraining from decisions that seem intuitively right but on closer examination are really stupid.
