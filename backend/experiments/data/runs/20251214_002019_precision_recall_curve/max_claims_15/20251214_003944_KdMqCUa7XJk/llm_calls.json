    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nThe week of Valentine's Day 2021, the temperature dropped below zero. Nobody could remember it being this cold for this long. This was Texas, not Siberia. But Texas is the energy state. There was nothing to fear. Just go home, turn on the heat, and hunker down. That's how it should have gone. Instead, over five days, four million Texans lost power during what turned out to be the coldest winter storm in a half a century. Hundreds died, including an 11-year-old boy who froze to death in his sleep. The state's electric grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, ERCOT, later reported the state was just four minutes away from total grid collapse. The media was quick to blame the state government for not being fully prepared and not acting fast enough. This may be true, but ERCOT's mistakes were symptoms, not the cause, of the problem. The real cause is decades of misguided policies that have left the Lone Star state with an unreliable energy infrastructure. It's a cautionary tale that the rest of the country needs to learn from. From 2010 to 2020, the population of Texas increased by 4 million people, and the state's economy grew by 35%. But while all this growth was happening, the state's reliable energy capacity was actually shrinking. Meanwhile, its unreliable energy capacity was surging. In fact, it almost tripled. Let's break this down. Reliable energy is fossil fuels\u2014coal and natural gas\u2014and nuclear. These fuels produce a near-constant flow of electricity. Unreliable, or variable energy, is renewable energy\u2014wind and solar. They're unreliable because they depend on the whims of Mother Nature. In 2020, Texans got 25% of their energy from renewables. During the February storm, however, that fell to 8%, at one point reaching a deadly low of just 1.5%. The reason? Renewable energy only works when the weather cooperates, but it's useless when it doesn't\u2014like when it conjures up a giant snowstorm. Solar panels don't capture sunlight and wind turbines don't spin when covered in snow and ice. Given renewables' unreliability, how is it that Texas, of all places, became so dependent on them? That story begins in 1999, when Texas politicians on the left and the right fell in love with the idea that they could turn the state into a green energy powerhouse. It sounded like a great idea at the time: Instead of passing any new mandates, they would do it by offering massive subsidies, marketed as \"incentives,\" to produce wind and solar power. This ended up working out great for the wind and solar companies, but not so great for reliable energy providers. To illustrate this, imagine that you own a restaurant. One day you learn that your competitor down the street is getting government support. He gets so much help that, instead of charging his customers, he can pay them to eat his food. Not surprisingly, your customers abandon your restaurant for his. Your competitor prospers off the taxpayers' backs while your business withers. Let's apply this analogy to the real world of renewable energy. Wind and solar get so much in subsidies they're guaranteed a profit. And unlike fossil fuel producers, they're not even required to provide reliable power. It's no wonder fossil fuel plants are closing, and nuclear plants are not being built. The wind and solar companies are protected from the laws of supply and demand. They can't lose, and the fossil fuel plants can't compete. That's how out of whack the Texas electricity market has become. Since 2006, the state has subsidized renewable energy to the tune of $19 billion. All of this came right out of Texans' wallets, courtesy of ever-increasing electric bills and rising property taxes. And what does Texas have to show for it? An electric grid that failed when Texans needed it most. Unfortunately, this scenario is playing out across America. Over the past decade, the federal government has spent over $230 billion on energy subsidies, and that doesn't even include subsidies the states give away. It's true that Uncle Sam also grants favors to fossil fuel companies. Renewable energy advocates love to point this out, but here's what they neglect to mention: compared to fossil fuel companies, for every unit of electricity generated, Washington subsidizes wind 17 times and solar 75 times more. Yet, despite all this aid, renewables provide just 4 percent of the country's total energy supply. The verdict is in: renewable energy is expensive and unreliable. And if it can render America's leading power producer powerless, it can do the same to your state. Government meddling got us into this mess. It's time for politicians to step aside and let the free market get us out of it. I'm Jason Isaac from the Texas Public Policy Foundation, for Prager University.",

At the same time, it also became more diverse.\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nMARCH 26, 2020 \u2014 Six of the 10 counties with the largest population gains this decade were in Texas \u2014 Harris, Tarrant, Bexar, Dallas, Collin, and Travis \u2014 according to the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s July 1, 2019, population estimates released today. The statistics provide population estimates and components of change for the nation\u2019s 384 metropolitan statistical areas, 542 micropolitan statistical areas and 3,142 counties.\nAmong the nation\u2019s counties, the top 10 with the largest numeric gains since 2010 are all located in the South and the West. In addition to the six Texas counties, the remaining four counties on the list are Maricopa County, Arizona; King County, Washington; Clark County, Nevada; and Riverside County, California. Texas counties also occupied the most spots of any state in the top 10 fastest growing since 2010, where Hays, Comal, Kendall, and Williamson all made the list.\nDespite the growth in some counties, over half (53.6%) of the counties in the United States were smaller in 2019 than they were in 2010. These patterns of growth or decline were largely related to county size, with most small counties losing population this decade and most large counties gaining.\n\u201cOne interesting trend we have seen this decade is widespread population decline among smaller counties, while larger counties tended to have population growth,\u201d said Dr. Christine Hartley, a demographer in the Census Bureau\u2019s Population Division. \u201cThree out of four counties with a population of less than 10,000 in 2010 had even smaller populations in 2019. At the same time, three out of four counties of 50,000 or more were larger in 2019 compared to 2010.\u201d This pattern among larger counties was particularly evident in the West and South.\nAmong metropolitan areas, Phoenix-Mesa-Chandler, AZ, with a population of 4,948,203 in 2019, replaced Boston-Cambridge-Newton, MA-NH as the 10th most populous metropolitan area in the country (Table 4). Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, TX had the largest numeric gain since 2010, with an increase of 1,206,599 (19.0%) (Table 5).\nOf counties with a population of 20,000 or more in 2018 and 2019, Williams County, North Dakota, was the fastest-growing county this decade, increasing by 67.8% (from 22,399 to 37,589) between 2010 and 2019 (Table 3). The rapid growth experienced by Williams County, North Dakota, between 2010 and 2019 was largely due to an 11,233 gain from net domestic migration (movement into the county from elsewhere in the United States). The county also grew between 2010 and 2019 by natural increase (3,400) and net international migration (170).\nAdditional Highlights:\nMetropolitan Areas\nVintage 2019 is the last series of population estimates to be released before the completion of the 2020 Decennial Census, which is currently underway across the nation. Data from the 2020 Census will be released beginning this December and running all through 2021. During the remainder of 2020, the Census Bureau will release estimates of the July 1, 2019 population for the nation, states and counties by age, sex, race and Hispanic origin. Population estimates for Puerto Rico and its municipios by age and sex will be released as well. These estimates include counties and cities affected by the 2017 hurricane season. Regular releases of the population estimates will resume with the Vintage 2021 estimates series.\nAmerican FactFinder (AFF) will be taken offline on March 31, 2020. Population and housing unit estimates data previously released on AFF are now available on the Population and Housing Unit Estimates website. With each new release of annual estimates, the entire time series of estimates is revised for all years back to the last census. All previously-published estimates (e.g., old vintages) are superseded and archived on the FTP2 site. Files previously released on AFF are also available on the FTP2 site. Please use the searchable index of the FTP2 site for a complete inventory of all content available on the site.\n###\nShare\nSubscribe\nContact\nPublic Information Office\n301-763-3030\npio@census.gov\nRelated Information\nReceive Updates\nTo sign up for updates please enter your email address.\nStay Current\nAmerica Counts\nDirector\u2019s Blog\nDeputy Director\u2019s Blog\nRandom Samplings\nResearch Matters\nStay Connected\nContact\nSupport\nJobs\nFollow\nMeasuring America's People and Economy\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The final report includes additional details regarding the need to strengthen rules for cold weather preparedness and coordination to prevent a recurrence of last winter\u2019s blackouts.\nIn February 2021, a severe cold weather event \u2013 also known as Winter Storm Uri \u2013 caused numerous outages, derates or failures to start at electric generating plants scattered across the region. The Texas grid operator (Electric Reliability Council of Texas or ERCOT) ordered a total of 20,000 MW of rolling blackouts in an effort to prevent grid collapse; this represents the largest manually controlled load shedding event in U.S. history. More than 4.5 million people in Texas lost power \u2013 some for as long as four days. Tragically, the loss of electricity caused the deaths of numerous Texans.\n\u201cThe final report on Winter Storm Uri is a sobering analysis that highlights the significant work that needs to be done. I previously committed to take the recommendations seriously, and I plan to do exactly that,\u201d FERC Chairman Rich Glick said. \u201cThe devastating effects of extreme cold on our bulk power system\u2019s ability to operate in 2011 and now, 2021, must not be allowed to happen again.

Notably, a combination of freezing issues (44.2 percent) and fuel issues (31.4 percent) caused 75.6 percent of the unplanned generating unit outages, derates and failures to start. Of particular note, protecting just four types of power plant components from icing and freezing could have reduced outages by 67 percent in the ERCOT region, 47 percent in the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) and 55 percent in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator South (MISO) regions. Natural gas-fired units represented 58 percent of all generating units experiencing unplanned outages, derates or failures to start. The remaining portion was comprised of wind (27 percent), coal (6 percent), solar (2 percent) and other generation types (7 percent), with four nuclear units making up less than 1 percent.\nToday\u2019s final report provides more details:\nThe Final Report includes 28 formal recommendations that seek to prevent a recurrence of the failures experienced during the February 2021 cold weather event. These recommendations include important revisions to the NERC Reliability Standards surrounding generator winterization and gas-electric coordination.\nAdditional recommendations are included regarding topics such as cold weather impacts on mechanical and electrical components, utilization of weather forecasts to better predict electric demand, and increasing the ability to rotate rolling blackouts, amongst other recommendations. The report also encourages additional study of the ERCOT system\u2019s reliability issues, guidance on identification of natural gas infrastructure for protection from rolling blackouts, and additional ways to address natural gas fuel supply shortfalls during extreme cold weather events.\nThe full report is available here.\nThe presentation of the preliminary findings released in September 2021 is available here.\nR22-6\nThis page was last updated on November 16, 2021\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The final report includes additional details regarding the need to strengthen rules for cold weather preparedness and coordination to prevent a recurrence of last winter\u2019s blackouts.\nIn February 2021, a severe cold weather event \u2013 also known as Winter Storm Uri \u2013 caused numerous outages, derates or failures to start at electric generating plants scattered across the region. The Texas grid operator (Electric Reliability Council of Texas or ERCOT) ordered a total of 20,000 MW of rolling blackouts in an effort to prevent grid collapse; this represents the largest manually controlled load shedding event in U.S. history. More than 4.5 million people in Texas lost power \u2013 some for as long as four days. Tragically, the loss of electricity caused the deaths of numerous Texans.\n\u201cThe final report on Winter Storm Uri is a sobering analysis that highlights the significant work that needs to be done. I previously committed to take the recommendations seriously, and I plan to do exactly that,\u201d FERC Chairman Rich Glick said. \u201cThe devastating effects of extreme cold on our bulk power system\u2019s ability to operate in 2011 and now, 2021, must not be allowed to happen again. We have a duty to protect the bulk power system and public safety and we will do just that.\u201d\n\u201cExtreme weather events, such as the one in February 2021, are unfortunately becoming more commonplace and the electricity ecosystem needs to come together to plan for and prepare to operate under more extreme, longer duration, and wide area weather events,\u201d NERC President and Chief Executive Officer Jim Robb said. \u201cThe FERC-NERC-Regional Entity Staff Report also highlights the need for substantially better coordination between the natural gas system and the electric system to ensure a reliable supply that nearly 400 million people across North America depend upon to support their way of life.\u201d\nToday\u2019s final report highlights the critical need for stronger mandatory electric reliability standards, particularly with respect to generator cold weather-critical components and systems. Notably, a combination of freezing issues (44.2 percent) and fuel issues (31.4 percent) caused 75.6 percent of the unplanned generating unit outages, derates and failures to start. Of particular note, protecting just four types of power plant components from icing and freezing could have reduced outages by 67 percent in the ERCOT region, 47 percent in the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) and 55 percent in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator South (MISO) regions. Natural gas-fired units represented 58 percent of all generating units experiencing unplanned outages, derates or failures to start. The remaining portion was comprised of wind (27 percent), coal (6 percent), solar (2 percent) and other generation types (7 percent), with four nuclear units making up less than 1 percent.\nToday\u2019s final report provides more details:\nThe Final Report includes 28 formal recommendations that seek to prevent a recurrence of the failures experienced during the February 2021 cold weather event. These recommendations include important revisions to the NERC Reliability Standards surrounding generator winterization and gas-electric coordination.\nAdditional recommendations are included regarding topics such as cold weather impacts on mechanical and electrical components, utilization of weather forecasts to better predict electric demand, and increasing the ability to rotate rolling blackouts, amongst other recommendations. The report also encourages additional study of the ERCOT system\u2019s reliability issues, guidance on identification of natural gas infrastructure for protection from rolling blackouts, and additional ways to address natural gas fuel supply shortfalls during extreme cold weather events.\nThe full report is available here.\nThe presentation of the preliminary findings released in September 2021 is available here.\nR22-6\nThis page was last updated on November 16, 2021\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The final report includes additional details regarding the need to strengthen rules for cold weather preparedness and coordination to prevent a recurrence of last winter\u2019s blackouts.\nIn February 2021, a severe cold weather event \u2013 also known as Winter Storm Uri \u2013 caused numerous outages, derates or failures to start at electric generating plants scattered across the region. The Texas grid operator (Electric Reliability Council of Texas or ERCOT) ordered a total of 20,000 MW of rolling blackouts in an effort to prevent grid collapse; this represents the largest manually controlled load shedding event in U.S. history. More than 4.5 million people in Texas lost power \u2013 some for as long as four days. Tragically, the loss of electricity caused the deaths of numerous Texans.\n\u201cThe final report on Winter Storm Uri is a sobering analysis that highlights the significant work that needs to be done. I previously committed to take the recommendations seriously, and I plan to do exactly that,\u201d FERC Chairman Rich Glick said. \u201cThe devastating effects of extreme cold on our bulk power system\u2019s ability to operate in 2011 and now, 2021, must not be allowed to happen again. We have a duty to protect the bulk power system and public safety and we will do just that.\u201d\n\u201cExtreme weather events, such as the one in February 2021, are unfortunately becoming more commonplace and the electricity ecosystem needs to come together to plan for and prepare to operate under more extreme, longer duration, and wide area weather events,\u201d NERC President and Chief Executive Officer Jim Robb said. \u201cThe FERC-NERC-Regional Entity Staff Report also highlights the need for substantially better coordination between the natural gas system and the electric system to ensure a reliable supply that nearly 400 million people across North America depend upon to support their way of life.\u201d\nToday\u2019s final report highlights the critical need for stronger mandatory electric reliability standards, particularly with respect to generator cold weather-critical components and systems. Notably, a combination of freezing issues (44.2 percent) and fuel issues (31.4 percent) caused 75.6 percent of the unplanned generating unit outages, derates and failures to start. Of particular note, protecting just four types of power plant components from icing and freezing could have reduced outages by 67 percent in the ERCOT region, 47 percent in the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) and 55 percent in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator South (MISO) regions. Natural gas-fired units represented 58 percent of all generating units experiencing unplanned outages, derates or failures to start. The remaining portion was comprised of wind (27 percent), coal (6 percent), solar (2 percent) and other generation types (7 percent), with four nuclear units making up less than 1 percent.\nToday\u2019s final report provides more details:\nThe Final Report includes 28 formal recommendations that seek to prevent a recurrence of the failures experienced during the February 2021 cold weather event. These recommendations include important revisions to the NERC Reliability Standards surrounding generator winterization and gas-electric coordination.\nAdditional recommendations are included regarding topics such as cold weather impacts on mechanical and electrical components, utilization of weather forecasts to better predict electric demand, and increasing the ability to rotate rolling blackouts, amongst other recommendations. The report also encourages additional study of the ERCOT system\u2019s reliability issues, guidance on identification of natural gas infrastructure for protection from rolling blackouts, and additional ways to address natural gas fuel supply shortfalls during extreme cold weather events.\nThe full report is available here.\nThe presentation of the preliminary findings released in September 2021 is available here.\nR22-6\nThis page was last updated on November 16, 2021\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The storms triggered the worst energy infrastructure failure in Texas state history, leading to shortages of water, food, and heat.[8] More than 4.5 million homes and businesses were left without power,[9][10][11][12] some for several days. At least 246 people were killed directly or indirectly,[3] with some estimates as high as 702 killed as a result of the crisis.[4]\nState officials, including Republican governor Greg Abbott,[13] initially erroneously blamed[14] the outages on frozen wind turbines and solar panels. Data showed that failure to winterize traditional power sources, principally natural gas infrastructure but also to a lesser extent wind turbines, had caused the grid failure,[15][16] with a drop in power production from natural gas more than five times greater than that from wind turbines. Texas's power grid has long been separate from the two major national grids to avoid federal oversight, though it is still connected to the other national grids and Mexico's;[17] the limited number of ties made it difficult for the state to import electricity from other states during the crisis.[18] Deregulation of its electricity market beginning in the 1990s resulted in competition in wholesale electricity prices, but also cost cutting for contingency preparation.[18]\nThe crisis drew much attention to the state's lack of preparedness for such storms,[19] and to a report from U.S. federal regulators ten years earlier that had warned Texas that its power plants would fail in sufficiently cold conditions.[20][21] Damages due to the cold wave and winter storm were estimated to be at least $195 billion,[5] likely the most expensive disaster in the state's history.[22] According to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the Texas power grid was four minutes and 37 seconds away from complete failure when partial grid shutdowns were implemented.[23][24] During the crisis, some energy firms made billions in profits, while others went bankrupt, due to some firms being able to pass extremely high wholesale prices ($9,000/MWh, typically $50/MWh) on to consumers, while others could not, with this price being allegedly held at the $9,000 cap by ERCOT for two days longer than necessary, creating $16 billion in unnecessary charges.[25][26]\nIn 2011, Texas was hit by the Groundhog Day blizzard between February 1 and 5, resulting in rolling blackouts across more than 75% of the state.[27] Many roads around Houston were impassable, and boil-water advisories were issued in several areas.[28] Following this disaster, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation made several recommendations for upgrading Texas's electrical infrastructure to prevent a similar event occurring in the future, but these recommendations were ignored due to the cost of winterizing the systems.[29] At the time the blackouts and failures in the power grid were likened to those that occurred in December 1989, after which similar recommendations were made to the state government and ERCOT, which were similarly ignored.[30][29] On August 16, 2011, a 357-page report was released by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in response to the February 2011 power outage in Texas.[31]\nIn mid-February 2021, a series of severe winter storms swept across the United States. This outbreak was due to the polar jet stream dipping particularly far south into the U.S.,[32] stretching from Washington to Texas, and running back north along the East Coast, allowing a polar vortex to bring very cold air across the country, and spawning multiple storms along the jet stream track as a result.[33] This weather phenomenon resulted in record low temperatures throughout Texas, with temperatures in Dallas, Austin, Houston and San Antonio falling below temperatures in Anchorage, Alaska.[34]\nOn February 10, a winter storm formed north of the Gulf coast, dropping significant amounts of sleet and ice on many states in the Deep South and the Ohio Valley, including Texas, Georgia, Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee, as well as states on the East Coast.[35] A second storm developed off the Pacific Northwest on February 13 and began to gradually develop into an organized storm as it tracked southward toward Texas. It grew even more organized as it turned toward the northeast U.S. before splitting in half \u2014 one half continuing into Quebec and the other moving out over the Atlantic Ocean.[36]\nThis storm, along with various other storms from the previous two weeks, resulted in over 75% of the contiguous U.S. being covered in snow.[37] This storm was directly responsible for nearly 10 million people losing power, with 5.2 million in the U.S. and 4.7 million in Mexico.[38][9] A third winter storm caused an additional 4 million power outages, and 29 deaths, with 23 in the U.S. and 6 in Mexico. At least 246 people lost their lives during the winter storms.[3][39][40]\nThe winter storm caused a record low temperature at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport of \u22122 \u00b0F (\u221219 \u00b0C) on February 16, the coldest in North Texas in 72 years.[44] Many Texan homes, though typically well-insulated to deal with extreme summer heat, may have lower efficiency heating systems, many with heat pumps backed up by inefficient electric resistance heaters for extreme cold ambient temperatures, resulting in extremely high electricity demand in those conditions.[22] Power equipment in Texas was not winterized, leaving it vulnerable to extended periods of cold weather.[45][46] Natural gas power generating facilities had equipment freeze up and faced shortages of fuel.

The final report includes additional details regarding the need to strengthen rules for cold weather preparedness and coordination to prevent a recurrence of last winter\u2019s blackouts.\nIn February 2021, a severe cold weather event \u2013 also known as Winter Storm Uri \u2013 caused numerous outages, derates or failures to start at electric generating plants scattered across the region. The Texas grid operator (Electric Reliability Council of Texas or ERCOT) ordered a total of 20,000 MW of rolling blackouts in an effort to prevent grid collapse; this represents the largest manually controlled load shedding event in U.S. history. More than 4.5 million people in Texas lost power \u2013 some for as long as four days. Tragically, the loss of electricity caused the deaths of numerous Texans.\n\u201cThe final report on Winter Storm Uri is a sobering analysis that highlights the significant work that needs to be done. I previously committed to take the recommendations seriously, and I plan to do exactly that,\u201d FERC Chairman Rich Glick said. \u201cThe devastating effects of extreme cold on our bulk power system\u2019s ability to operate in 2011 and now, 2021, must not be allowed to happen again. We have a duty to protect the bulk power system and public safety and we will do just that.\u201d\n\u201cExtreme weather events, such as the one in February 2021, are unfortunately becoming more commonplace and the electricity ecosystem needs to come together to plan for and prepare to operate under more extreme, longer duration, and wide area weather events,\u201d NERC President and Chief Executive Officer Jim Robb said. \u201cThe FERC-NERC-Regional Entity Staff Report also highlights the need for substantially better coordination between the natural gas system and the electric system to ensure a reliable supply that nearly 400 million people across North America depend upon to support their way of life.\u201d\nToday\u2019s final report highlights the critical need for stronger mandatory electric reliability standards, particularly with respect to generator cold weather-critical components and systems. Notably, a combination of freezing issues (44.2 percent) and fuel issues (31.4 percent) caused 75.6 percent of the unplanned generating unit outages, derates and failures to start. Of particular note, protecting just four types of power plant components from icing and freezing could have reduced outages by 67 percent in the ERCOT region, 47 percent in the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) and 55 percent in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator South (MISO) regions. Natural gas-fired units represented 58 percent of all generating units experiencing unplanned outages, derates or failures to start. The remaining portion was comprised of wind (27 percent), coal (6 percent), solar (2 percent) and other generation types (7 percent), with four nuclear units making up less than 1 percent.\nToday\u2019s final report provides more details:\nThe Final Report includes 28 formal recommendations that seek to prevent a recurrence of the failures experienced during the February 2021 cold weather event. These recommendations include important revisions to the NERC Reliability Standards surrounding generator winterization and gas-electric coordination.\nAdditional recommendations are included regarding topics such as cold weather impacts on mechanical and electrical components, utilization of weather forecasts to better predict electric demand, and increasing the ability to rotate rolling blackouts, amongst other recommendations. The report also encourages additional study of the ERCOT system\u2019s reliability issues, guidance on identification of natural gas infrastructure for protection from rolling blackouts, and additional ways to address natural gas fuel supply shortfalls during extreme cold weather events.\nThe full report is available here.\nThe presentation of the preliminary findings released in September 2021 is available here.\nR22-6\nThis page was last updated on November 16, 2021\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Lily joined the team as the Renewable Energy Economic Impact Intern for the summer of 2025. She is pursuing a Bachelor of Science in International Affairs with a concentration in International Economics at The George Washington University. Subsidies have long accelerated American energy production. And these subsidies have had their intended impact: in 2023, the United States ranked as the world\u2019s second-largest energy producer, leveraging government support to develop a multi-trillion dollar energy industry that provides reliable, affordable power with an all-of-the-above strategy that advances national security and drives the world\u2019s largest economy.\nMore Than a Century of Subsidies\nThe US government has a deep history of subsidizing energy, starting in 1916 when Congress introduced tax incentives to boost fossil fuel production and industry during World War I. From 1918 to 1932, the US government continued to subsidize oil and natural gas to the tune of $1.8 billion per year (adjusting for inflation). The subsidies protected American interests and boosted the economy in our time of need.\nFast forward to 1973, and America faced yet another threat to national and economic security. The oil embargo implemented by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' Arab members shocked the country, and the US economy shrunk by nearly $70 billion in just a year. To save consumers from soaring gas prices and social, economic, and geopolitical instability, the federal government increased its support for alternative forms of fuel and electricity, like nuclear and renewables.\nAmerica\u2019s use of subsidies didn\u2019t end there. Between 1994 and 2009, Democratic and Republican administrations alike subsidized renewable energy with almost $400 million per year to diversify the country\u2019s energy mix, keep electricity bills economical, and scale up energy production to meet rapidly rising demand. On both sides of the aisle, subsidies have often been viewed as practical tools to add to the energy sector\u2019s existing capacity and stabilize prices for American consumers.\nEssential Support For Energy\u2019s Development\nBeyond protecting America\u2019s national security interests and encouraging economic growth, subsidies have been key to the early-stage development of the energy industry itself. By targeting emerging fuel sources, the federal government helped the industry scale up and deliver affordable power more efficiently.\nDuring the first 15 years of federal support for fossil fuels, subsidies averaged an inflation adjusted $1.8 billion per year. Comparatively, during the first 15 years of support for nuclear and renewables, the government offered an average of $3.3 billion and $400 million of support per year, respectively, to encourage the industries\u2019 economic growth \u2013 speeding up development timelines and keeping prices manageable for consumers.\nAs the primary source of energy in the US, fossil fuels have received more in federal subsidies than any other type of energy. According to a report commissioned by the Energy Information Association, fossil fuels received $676 billion in federal support between 1950 and 2016. Oil alone received $302 billion between 1950 and 2003, almost half of all federal support for energy over that time period.\nSince the late 1990s, the trajectory of renewable energy subsidies has mirrored that of fossil fuels. Between 1950 and 2016 renewable energy subsidies comprised only 16% of all federal energy subsidies. From 2016 to 2022, the number jumped to almost 53%, with wind and solar subsidies totaling over $55 billion. Just like oil and gas decades earlier, renewables got the push they needed to develop quickly and keep pace with America\u2019s rising demand for power, and now receive fewer federal subsidies.\nFor policymakers, the motivation has stayed consistent: keep energy reliable, affordable, and abundant. That\u2019s why administrations from both parties have invested heavily in the American energy industry. And based on calculations made from data in a report written for DBL Partners, it worked: federal support helped expand the renewable energy industry\u2019s capacity enough to power an extra one million homes each year between 1994 and 2009 \u2013 growth that wouldn\u2019t have happened on its own.\nSubsidies Are Not A Permanent Tool\nGovernment investment in fuel sources isn\u2019t about propping up industries forever; it's about giving them the boost they need to start being used before they are fully cost competitive. Subsidies help stabilize prices and spark development, and as the industries mature, they ideally will rely less on federal support. Fossil fuels are a clear example: between 2016 and 2022, their share of total subsidies dropped by 42% from what they received from 1950 to 2016. Viewed in this context, the increased support for renewables in recent years wasn\u2019t a policy shift, but simply an extension of America\u2019s longstanding approach: investing in emerging energy sources until they become self-sustaining.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The storms triggered the worst energy infrastructure failure in Texas state history, leading to shortages of water, food, and heat.[8] More than 4.5 million homes and businesses were left without power,[9][10][11][12] some for several days. At least 246 people were killed directly or indirectly,[3] with some estimates as high as 702 killed as a result of the crisis.[4]\nState officials, including Republican governor Greg Abbott,[13] initially erroneously blamed[14] the outages on frozen wind turbines and solar panels. Data showed that failure to winterize traditional power sources, principally natural gas infrastructure but also to a lesser extent wind turbines, had caused the grid failure,[15][16] with a drop in power production from natural gas more than five times greater than that from wind turbines. Texas's power grid has long been separate from the two major national grids to avoid federal oversight, though it is still connected to the other national grids and Mexico's;[17] the limited number of ties made it difficult for the state to import electricity from other states during the crisis.[18] Deregulation of its electricity market beginning in the 1990s resulted in competition in wholesale electricity prices, but also cost cutting for contingency preparation.[18]\nThe crisis drew much attention to the state's lack of preparedness for such storms,[19] and to a report from U.S. federal regulators ten years earlier that had warned Texas that its power plants would fail in sufficiently cold conditions.[20][21] Damages due to the cold wave and winter storm were estimated to be at least $195 billion,[5] likely the most expensive disaster in the state's history.[22] According to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the Texas power grid was four minutes and 37 seconds away from complete failure when partial grid shutdowns were implemented.[23][24] During the crisis, some energy firms made billions in profits, while others went bankrupt, due to some firms being able to pass extremely high wholesale prices ($9,000/MWh, typically $50/MWh) on to consumers, while others could not, with this price being allegedly held at the $9,000 cap by ERCOT for two days longer than necessary, creating $16 billion in unnecessary charges.[25][26]\nIn 2011, Texas was hit by the Groundhog Day blizzard between February 1 and 5, resulting in rolling blackouts across more than 75% of the state.[27] Many roads around Houston were impassable, and boil-water advisories were issued in several areas.[28] Following this disaster, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation made several recommendations for upgrading Texas's electrical infrastructure to prevent a similar event occurring in the future, but these recommendations were ignored due to the cost of winterizing the systems.[29] At the time the blackouts and failures in the power grid were likened to those that occurred in December 1989, after which similar recommendations were made to the state government and ERCOT, which were similarly ignored.[30][29] On August 16, 2011, a 357-page report was released by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in response to the February 2011 power outage in Texas.[31]\nIn mid-February 2021, a series of severe winter storms swept across the United States. This outbreak was due to the polar jet stream dipping particularly far south into the U.S.,[32] stretching from Washington to Texas, and running back north along the East Coast, allowing a polar vortex to bring very cold air across the country, and spawning multiple storms along the jet stream track as a result.[33] This weather phenomenon resulted in record low temperatures throughout Texas, with temperatures in Dallas, Austin, Houston and San Antonio falling below temperatures in Anchorage, Alaska.[34]\nOn February 10, a winter storm formed north of the Gulf coast, dropping significant amounts of sleet and ice on many states in the Deep South and the Ohio Valley, including Texas, Georgia, Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee, as well as states on the East Coast.[35] A second storm developed off the Pacific Northwest on February 13 and began to gradually develop into an organized storm as it tracked southward toward Texas. It grew even more organized as it turned toward the northeast U.S. before splitting in half \u2014 one half continuing into Quebec and the other moving out over the Atlantic Ocean.[36]\nThis storm, along with various other storms from the previous two weeks, resulted in over 75% of the contiguous U.S. being covered in snow.[37] This storm was directly responsible for nearly 10 million people losing power, with 5.2 million in the U.S. and 4.7 million in Mexico.[38][9] A third winter storm caused an additional 4 million power outages, and 29 deaths, with 23 in the U.S. and 6 in Mexico. At least 246 people lost their lives during the winter storms.[3][39][40]\nThe winter storm caused a record low temperature at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport of \u22122 \u00b0F (\u221219 \u00b0C) on February 16, the coldest in North Texas in 72 years.[44] Many Texan homes, though typically well-insulated to deal with extreme summer heat, may have lower efficiency heating systems, many with heat pumps backed up by inefficient electric resistance heaters for extreme cold ambient temperatures, resulting in extremely high electricity demand in those conditions.[22] Power equipment in Texas was not winterized, leaving it vulnerable to extended periods of cold weather.[45][46] Natural gas power generating facilities had equipment freeze up and faced shortages of fuel. Texas Governor Greg Abbott and some other politicians initially said renewable energy sources were the cause for the power outages, citing frozen wind turbines as an example of their unreliability.[47]\nVir\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Lily joined the team as the Renewable Energy Economic Impact Intern for the summer of 2025. She is pursuing a Bachelor of Science in International Affairs with a concentration in International Economics at The George Washington University. Subsidies have long accelerated American energy production. And these subsidies have had their intended impact: in 2023, the United States ranked as the world\u2019s second-largest energy producer, leveraging government support to develop a multi-trillion dollar energy industry that provides reliable, affordable power with an all-of-the-above strategy that advances national security and drives the world\u2019s largest economy.\nMore Than a Century of Subsidies\nThe US government has a deep history of subsidizing energy, starting in 1916 when Congress introduced tax incentives to boost fossil fuel production and industry during World War I. From 1918 to 1932, the US government continued to subsidize oil and natural gas to the tune of $1.8 billion per year (adjusting for inflation). The subsidies protected American interests and boosted the economy in our time of need.\nFast forward to 1973, and America faced yet another threat to national and economic security. The oil embargo implemented by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' Arab members shocked the country, and the US economy shrunk by nearly $70 billion in just a year. To save consumers from soaring gas prices and social, economic, and geopolitical instability, the federal government increased its support for alternative forms of fuel and electricity, like nuclear and renewables.\nAmerica\u2019s use of subsidies didn\u2019t end there. Between 1994 and 2009, Democratic and Republican administrations alike subsidized renewable energy with almost $400 million per year to diversify the country\u2019s energy mix, keep electricity bills economical, and scale up energy production to meet rapidly rising demand. On both sides of the aisle, subsidies have often been viewed as practical tools to add to the energy sector\u2019s existing capacity and stabilize prices for American consumers.\nEssential Support For Energy\u2019s Development\nBeyond protecting America\u2019s national security interests and encouraging economic growth, subsidies have been key to the early-stage development of the energy industry itself. By targeting emerging fuel sources, the federal government helped the industry scale up and deliver affordable power more efficiently.\nDuring the first 15 years of federal support for fossil fuels, subsidies averaged an inflation adjusted $1.8 billion per year. Comparatively, during the first 15 years of support for nuclear and renewables, the government offered an average of $3.3 billion and $400 million of support per year, respectively, to encourage the industries\u2019 economic growth \u2013 speeding up development timelines and keeping prices manageable for consumers.\nAs the primary source of energy in the US, fossil fuels have received more in federal subsidies than any other type of energy. According to a report commissioned by the Energy Information Association, fossil fuels received $676 billion in federal support between 1950 and 2016. Oil alone received $302 billion between 1950 and 2003, almost half of all federal support for energy over that time period.\nSince the late 1990s, the trajectory of renewable energy subsidies has mirrored that of fossil fuels. Between 1950 and 2016 renewable energy subsidies comprised only 16% of all federal energy subsidies. From 2016 to 2022, the number jumped to almost 53%, with wind and solar subsidies totaling over $55 billion. Just like oil and gas decades earlier, renewables got the push they needed to develop quickly and keep pace with America\u2019s rising demand for power, and now receive fewer federal subsidies.\nFor policymakers, the motivation has stayed consistent: keep energy reliable, affordable, and abundant. That\u2019s why administrations from both parties have invested heavily in the American energy industry. And based on calculations made from data in a report written for DBL Partners, it worked: federal support helped expand the renewable energy industry\u2019s capacity enough to power an extra one million homes each year between 1994 and 2009 \u2013 growth that wouldn\u2019t have happened on its own.\nSubsidies Are Not A Permanent Tool\nGovernment investment in fuel sources isn\u2019t about propping up industries forever; it's about giving them the boost they need to start being used before they are fully cost competitive. Subsidies help stabilize prices and spark development, and as the industries mature, they ideally will rely less on federal support. Fossil fuels are a clear example: between 2016 and 2022, their share of total subsidies dropped by 42% from what they received from 1950 to 2016. Viewed in this context, the increased support for renewables in recent years wasn\u2019t a policy shift, but simply an extension of America\u2019s longstanding approach: investing in emerging energy sources until they become self-sustaining.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Power Pool's Response To The February 2021 Winter Storm ... gas consumption in Texas fell to 4.1 Bcf/d, or 23 percent lower than February 2020.\n\nFull Page Content:\nIn February 2021, the state of Texas suffered a major power crisis, which came about during three severe winter storms sweeping across the United States on February 10\u201311,[6] 13\u201317 (known as Winter Storm Uri),[7] and 15\u201320. The storms triggered the worst energy infrastructure failure in Texas state history, leading to shortages of water, food, and heat.[8] More than 4.5 million homes and businesses were left without power,[9][10][11][12] some for several days. At least 246 people were killed directly or indirectly,[3] with some estimates as high as 702 killed as a result of the crisis.[4]\nState officials, including Republican governor Greg Abbott,[13] initially erroneously blamed[14] the outages on frozen wind turbines and solar panels. Data showed that failure to winterize traditional power sources, principally natural gas infrastructure but also to a lesser extent wind turbines, had caused the grid failure,[15][16] with a drop in power production from natural gas more than five times greater than that from wind turbines. Texas's power grid has long been separate from the two major national grids to avoid federal oversight, though it is still connected to the other national grids and Mexico's;[17] the limited number of ties made it difficult for the state to import electricity from other states during the crisis.[18] Deregulation of its electricity market beginning in the 1990s resulted in competition in wholesale electricity prices, but also cost cutting for contingency preparation.[18]\nThe crisis drew much attention to the state's lack of preparedness for such storms,[19] and to a report from U.S. federal regulators ten years earlier that had warned Texas that its power plants would fail in sufficiently cold conditions.[20][21] Damages due to the cold wave and winter storm were estimated to be at least $195 billion,[5] likely the most expensive disaster in the state's history.[22] According to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the Texas power grid was four minutes and 37 seconds away from complete failure when partial grid shutdowns were implemented.[23][24] During the crisis, some energy firms made billions in profits, while others went bankrupt, due to some firms being able to pass extremely high wholesale prices ($9,000/MWh, typically $50/MWh) on to consumers, while others could not, with this price being allegedly held at the $9,000 cap by ERCOT for two days longer than necessary, creating $16 billion in unnecessary charges.[25][26]\nIn 2011, Texas was hit by the Groundhog Day blizzard between February 1 and 5, resulting in rolling blackouts across more than 75% of the state.[27] Many roads around Houston were impassable, and boil-water advisories were issued in several areas.[28] Following this disaster, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation made several recommendations for upgrading Texas's electrical infrastructure to prevent a similar event occurring in the future, but these recommendations were ignored due to the cost of winterizing the systems.[29] At the time the blackouts and failures in the power grid were likened to those that occurred in December 1989, after which similar recommendations were made to the state government and ERCOT, which were similarly ignored.[30][29] On August 16, 2011, a 357-page report was released by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in response to the February 2011 power outage in Texas.[31]\nIn mid-February 2021, a series of severe winter storms swept across the United States. This outbreak was due to the polar jet stream dipping particularly far south into the U.S.,[32] stretching from Washington to Texas, and running back north along the East Coast, allowing a polar vortex to bring very cold air across the country, and spawning multiple storms along the jet stream track as a result.[33] This weather phenomenon resulted in record low temperatures throughout Texas, with temperatures in Dallas, Austin, Houston and San Antonio falling below temperatures in Anchorage, Alaska.[34]\nOn February 10, a winter storm formed north of the Gulf coast, dropping significant amounts of sleet and ice on many states in the Deep South and the Ohio Valley, including Texas, Georgia, Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee, as well as states on the East Coast.[35] A second storm developed off the Pacific Northwest on February 13 and began to gradually develop into an organized storm as it tracked southward toward Texas. It grew even more organized as it turned toward the northeast U.S. before splitting in half \u2014 one half continuing into Quebec and the other moving out over the Atlantic Ocean.[36]\nThis storm, along with various other storms from the previous two weeks, resulted in over 75% of the contiguous U.S. being covered in snow.[37] This storm was directly responsible for nearly 10 million people losing power, with 5.2 million in the U.S. and 4.7 million in Mexico.[38][9] A third winter storm caused an additional 4 million power outages, and 29 deaths, with 23 in the U.S. and 6 in Mexico. At least 246 people lost their lives during the winter storms.[3][39][40]\nThe winter storm caused a record low temperature at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport of \u22122 \u00b0F (\u221219 \u00b0C) on February 16, the coldest in North Texas in 72 years.[44] Many Texan homes, though typically well-insulated to deal with extreme summer heat, may have lower efficiency heating systems, many with heat pumps backed up by inefficient electric resistance heaters for extreme cold ambient temperatures, resulting in extremely high electricity demand in those conditions.[22] Power equipment in Texas was not winterized, leaving it vulnerable to extended periods of cold weather.[45][46] Natural gas power generating facilities had equipment freeze up and faced shortages of fuel. Texas Governor Greg Abbott and some other politicians initially said renewable energy sources were the cause for the power outages, citing frozen wind turbines as an example of their unreliability.[47]\nVir\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Lily joined the team as the Renewable Energy Economic Impact Intern for the summer of 2025. She is pursuing a Bachelor of Science in International Affairs with a concentration in International Economics at The George Washington University. Subsidies have long accelerated American energy production. And these subsidies have had their intended impact: in 2023, the United States ranked as the world\u2019s second-largest energy producer, leveraging government support to develop a multi-trillion dollar energy industry that provides reliable, affordable power with an all-of-the-above strategy that advances national security and drives the world\u2019s largest economy.\nMore Than a Century of Subsidies\nThe US government has a deep history of subsidizing energy, starting in 1916 when Congress introduced tax incentives to boost fossil fuel production and industry during World War I. From 1918 to 1932, the US government continued to subsidize oil and natural gas to the tune of $1.8 billion per year (adjusting for inflation). The subsidies protected American interests and boosted the economy in our time of need.\nFast forward to 1973, and America faced yet another threat to national and economic security. The oil embargo implemented by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' Arab members shocked the country, and the US economy shrunk by nearly $70 billion in just a year. To save consumers from soaring gas prices and social, economic, and geopolitical instability, the federal government increased its support for alternative forms of fuel and electricity, like nuclear and renewables.\nAmerica\u2019s use of subsidies didn\u2019t end there. Between 1994 and 2009, Democratic and Republican administrations alike subsidized renewable energy with almost $400 million per year to diversify the country\u2019s energy mix, keep electricity bills economical, and scale up energy production to meet rapidly rising demand. On both sides of the aisle, subsidies have often been viewed as practical tools to add to the energy sector\u2019s existing capacity and stabilize prices for American consumers.\nEssential Support For Energy\u2019s Development\nBeyond protecting America\u2019s national security interests and encouraging economic growth, subsidies have been key to the early-stage development of the energy industry itself. By targeting emerging fuel sources, the federal government helped the industry scale up and deliver affordable power more efficiently.\nDuring the first 15 years of federal support for fossil fuels, subsidies averaged an inflation adjusted $1.8 billion per year. Comparatively, during the first 15 years of support for nuclear and renewables, the government offered an average of $3.3 billion and $400 million of support per year, respectively, to encourage the industries\u2019 economic growth \u2013 speeding up development timelines and keeping prices manageable for consumers.\nAs the primary source of energy in the US, fossil fuels have received more in federal subsidies than any other type of energy. According to a report commissioned by the Energy Information Association, fossil fuels received $676 billion in federal support between 1950 and 2016. Oil alone received $302 billion between 1950 and 2003, almost half of all federal support for energy over that time period.\nSince the late 1990s, the trajectory of renewable energy subsidies has mirrored that of fossil fuels. Between 1950 and 2016 renewable energy subsidies comprised only 16% of all federal energy subsidies. From 2016 to 2022, the number jumped to almost 53%, with wind and solar subsidies totaling over $55 billion. Just like oil and gas decades earlier, renewables got the push they needed to develop quickly and keep pace with America\u2019s rising demand for power, and now receive fewer federal subsidies.\nFor policymakers, the motivation has stayed consistent: keep energy reliable, affordable, and abundant. That\u2019s why administrations from both parties have invested heavily in the American energy industry. And based on calculations made from data in a report written for DBL Partners, it worked: federal support helped expand the renewable energy industry\u2019s capacity enough to power an extra one million homes each year between 1994 and 2009 \u2013 growth that wouldn\u2019t have happened on its own.\nSubsidies Are Not A Permanent Tool\nGovernment investment in fuel sources isn\u2019t about propping up industries forever; it's about giving them the boost they need to start being used before they are fully cost competitive. Subsidies help stabilize prices and spark development, and as the industries mature, they ideally will rely less on federal support. Fossil fuels are a clear example: between 2016 and 2022, their share of total subsidies dropped by 42% from what they received from 1950 to 2016. Viewed in this context, the increased support for renewables in recent years wasn\u2019t a policy shift, but simply an extension of America\u2019s longstanding approach: investing in emerging energy sources until they become self-sustaining.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Texas' Power Grid Was 4 Minutes And 37 Seconds ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nLee esta historia en espa\u00f1ol.\nWe\u2019ve heard Texas\u2019 power grid came close to total failure early the morning of Feb. 15, but not exactly how close.\nOfficials at the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which manages the state\u2019s grid, showed its board a timeline Wednesday of events leading up to the grid's near-collapse. That timeline showed the grid was just 4 minutes and 37 seconds away from a cascading series of events that could have left Texas in the dark for weeks \u2014 if not longer.\nTo keep the grid running, officials said, operators need to have enough power to maintain a constant frequency of around 60 hertz (you can learn more about that here). But on the evening of Sunday, Feb. 14, temperatures were falling, snow and ice were blanketing Texas, and people were turning up their thermostats.\nMeanwhile, power plants across the state were going offline because of the cold weather; natural gas, coal, nuclear and wind energy sources were all failing. Equipment and pipelines were freezing up. At 12:15 a.m. Monday, ERCOT went to its first level of energy emergency alert.\nRELATED | Here Are Some Terms You Need To Know To Understand The Debate Over The Texas Blackout\nBut that wasn\u2019t enough. At 1:07 a.m., ERCOT went to the second level. This triggered some power reductions for industrial customers that volunteer to have power turned off when supply gets scarce.\nThings kept getting worse. By 1:23 a.m., one-third of the state\u2019s power-generation capacity was down. The highest alert was triggered, and ERCOT ordered power providers to start rolling blackouts.\nIf there\u2019s not enough power on the grid to meet demand, ERCOT officials said, the frequency of the grid drops below that 60 hertz level. That can cause physical damage to equipment that moves power around the state. And it can force more power plants to shut down \u2014 possibly leading to a complete failure of the grid.\nBut those initial rolling blackouts didn\u2019t solve the problem.\nStill more power plants went offline because of the weather. And by 1:43 a.m. Monday, the frequency of the grid was falling to dangerous levels. At about 1:51 a.m., the grid dropped below 59.4 hertz. That may not sound much different than 60 hertz, but if the frequency stayed under that threshold for 9 minutes or more, ERCOT officials said, it would trigger that cascading failure of the grid.\nWithin minutes, the frequency fell to about 59.3 hertz. Grid operators told power providers to expand rolling blackouts again.\nFour minutes and 23 seconds after it dipped below 59.4 hertz, the frequency began to rise as more customers were dumped from the grid. If it had stayed below that threshold for another 4 minutes and 37 seconds, the lights might still be out in Texas, ERCOT officials said.\n\u201cThat is the thing that we cannot allow to happen,\u201d said Bill Magness, ERCOT\u2019s president and CEO, told the board Wednesday. \u201cBecause if we have a blackout of the system, the system is out for an indeterminate amount of time. We may still be here today talking about when is the power going to come back on if we had let the system get into that condition.\u201d\nBy about 2:03 a.m., the grid was back at or above 60 hertz. But by that time, there was not enough power being produced to undo the blackouts \u2014 and as many of us know, some of the lights would stay out for days, until more power plants came back online.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

That timeline showed the grid was just 4 minutes and 37 seconds away from a cascading series of events that could have left Texas in the dark for weeks \u2014 if not longer.\nTo keep the grid running, officials said, operators need to have enough power to maintain a constant frequency of around 60 hertz (you can learn more about that here). But on the evening of Sunday, Feb. 14, temperatures were falling, snow and ice were blanketing Texas, and people were turning up their thermostats.\nMeanwhile, power plants across the state were going offline because of the cold weather; natural gas, coal, nuclear and wind energy sources were all failing. Equipment and pipelines were freezing up. At 12:15 a.m. Monday, ERCOT went to its first level of energy emergency alert.\nRELATED | Here Are Some Terms You Need To Know To Understand The Debate Over The Texas Blackout\nBut that wasn\u2019t enough. At 1:07 a.m., ERCOT went to the second level. This triggered some power reductions for industrial customers that volunteer to have power turned off when supply gets scarce.\nThings kept getting worse. By 1:23 a.m., one-third of the state\u2019s power-generation capacity was down. The highest alert was triggered, and ERCOT ordered power providers to start rolling blackouts.\nIf there\u2019s not enough power on the grid to meet demand, ERCOT officials said, the frequency of the grid drops below that 60 hertz level. That can cause physical damage to equipment that moves power around the state. And it can force more power plants to shut down \u2014 possibly leading to a complete failure of the grid.\nBut those initial rolling blackouts didn\u2019t solve the problem.\nStill more power plants went offline because of the weather. And by 1:43 a.m. Monday, the frequency of the grid was falling to dangerous levels. At about 1:51 a.m., the grid dropped below 59.4 hertz. That may not sound much different than 60 hertz, but if the frequency stayed under that threshold for 9 minutes or more, ERCOT officials said, it would trigger that cascading failure of the grid.\nWithin minutes, the frequency fell to about 59.3 hertz. Grid operators told power providers to expand rolling blackouts again.\nFour minutes and 23 seconds after it dipped below 59.4 hertz, the frequency began to rise as more customers were dumped from the grid. If it had stayed below that threshold for another 4 minutes and 37 seconds, the lights might still be out in Texas, ERCOT officials said.\n\u201cThat is the thing that we cannot allow to happen,\u201d said Bill Magness, ERCOT\u2019s president and CEO, told the board Wednesday. \u201cBecause if we have a blackout of the system, the system is out for an indeterminate amount of time. We may still be here today talking about when is the power going to come back on if we had let the system get into that condition.\u201d\nBy about 2:03 a.m., the grid was back at or above 60 hertz. But by that time, there was not enough power being produced to undo the blackouts \u2014 and as many of us know, some of the lights would stay out for days, until more power plants came back online.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",
