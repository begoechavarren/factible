We look at the Earth from space and we measure it on the ground. And what we see is that the planet's climate is changing. The last years have been the warmest since modern record-keeping began. It's serious. Even a little change in temperature can have big effects. And we're seeing some of those effects now. Sea levels are rising. We're seeing more extreme events like heatwaves and heavy rainfall and wildfire. And we know that a lot of those effects are going to increase with more warming. These changes are impacting decisions that some people make every day, like a farmer thinking about what crops to grow or a homeowner thinking about flood risk. But there's hope. There are scientists at NASA and around the world that are researching this. We know more about our planet than we have ever before, and we learn more every day. So we know why climate is changing. We know that it's due to increasing greenhouse gases from human activity. We also have tools that can help us better understand and better prepare for future climate change. So we develop computer models that help us understand how much it might change in the future. And we're also developing technologies here at NASA and around the world that can help us limit future warming or respond to the warming that we're experiencing. So why does climate change matter? It's real. It's serious, and it's here. We Asked a NASA Scientist. NASA. A NASA 360 Production.",

The past ten years have all been in the Top Ten, in an extraordinary streak of record-breaking temperatures.\nThe global average surface temperature was 1.55 \u00b0C (with a margin of uncertainty of \u00b1 0.13 \u00b0C) above the 1850-1900 average, according to WMO\u2019s consolidated analysis of the six datasets. This means that we have likely just experienced the first calendar year with a global mean temperature of more than 1.5\u00b0C above the 1850-1900 average.\n\u201cToday\u2019s assessment from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) proves yet again \u2013 global heating is a cold, hard fact,\u201d said UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3no Guterres.\n\u201cIndividual years pushing past the 1.5 degree limit do not mean the long-term goal is shot. It means we need to fight even harder to get on track. Blazing temperatures in 2024 require trail-blazing climate action in 2025,\u201d he said. \u201cThere's still time to avoid the worst of climate catastrophe. But leaders must act \u2013 now,\u201d he said.\nThe WMO provides a temperature assessment based on multiple sources of data to support international climate monitoring and to provide authoritative information for the UN Climate Change negotiating process. The datasets are from the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), Japan Meteorological Agency, NASA, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the UK\u2019s Met Office in collaboration with the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia (HadCRUT), and Berkeley Earth.\n\u201cClimate history is playing out before our eyes. We\u2019ve had not just one or two record-breaking years, but a full ten-year series. This has been accompanied by devastating and extreme weather, rising sea levels and melting ice, all powered by record-breaking greenhouse gas levels due to human activities,\u201d said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo.\n\u201cIt is important to emphasize that a single year of more than 1.5\u00b0C for a year does NOT mean that we have failed to meet Paris Agreement long-term temperature goals, which are measured over decades rather than an individual year. However, it is essential to recognize that every fraction of a degree of warming matters. Whether it is at a level below or above 1.5\u00b0C of warming, every additional increment of global warming increases the impacts on our lives, economies and our planet,\u201d said Celeste Saulo.\nThere is a margin of uncertainty in all temperature assessments.

Both factors are the result of increasing human greenhouse gas emissions driving Earth\u2019s temperatures higher.\nIf the planet surpasses 1.5\u20132\u00b0C of warming, irreversible impacts such as melting ice and sea level rise will significantly impact human and environmental sustainability.\nEarth has warmed 1\u00b0C (2\u00b0F) since 1880. The ocean\u2019s surface temperature rose about 1.5\u00b0F in that time because it absorbs more than 90 percent of the excess heat greenhouse gases trap in the atmosphere. Warmer water takes up more space, and this increase in volume\u2014the thermal expansion of water\u2014was sea level rise\u2019s main culprit over the last century.\nMeltwater from the world\u2019s diminishing ice sheets and glaciers also drives sea levels up, and it is now the main contributor to global sea level rise. Hotter air temperatures melt the surface of the ice while warmer ocean water erodes ice shelves from the sides and below, allowing more ice and meltwater to flow into the sea.\nThe Greenland ice sheet, the world\u2019s largest, is melting four times faster than it did in 2003 and is responsible for 20 percent of current sea level rise. The IPCC projects that by 2100, Greenland could contribute 3.1 to 10.6 inches (8 to 27 cm) to global sea level, and the melting of Antarctic ice may add another 1.2 to 11 inches (3 to 28 cm).\nAnother factor in rising sea levels is subsistence, when land sinks or settles due to natural geologic processes and human-made factors such as pumping water out of aquifers. The combined effects of coastal subsistence and rising seas worsen flooding and threaten densely-populated cities worldwide.\nLand is gradually rising in some parts of the world due to processes like the long-term rebound of land after losing the weight of ancient ice sheets. In parts of Canada, for example, the land is rising several millimeters each year. Rebounding land can make sea levels appear to increase more slowly, but it doesn\u2019t change or offset rising seas.\nData collected by a global network of tidal stations and sensors on satellites reveal local and global sea levels are rapidly rising.\nTide stations use GPS to monitor local sea levels around the world. Before GPS, an array of tide gauges collected the same data going back more than 200 years ago in some locations. Scientists began to use satellites to measure changes to the average height of global sea levels in the 1990s; they also use laser altimeters affixed to satellites to monitor changes in the size of ice sheets and glaciers and understand how this activity contributes to rising seas.\nScientists also take ocean temperature measurements from research vessels and using buoys and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs). By monitoring ocean heat, researchers learn how much thermal expansion might contribute to sea level rise. Together, satellite and tide station measurements show the rate of sea level rise has more than doubled since the start of the twentieth century to about .14 inches a year.\nHistorical, or proxy, information contained deep-sea sediments and cores of ancient ice enables scientists to reconstruct and understand how sea levels rose and fell in the past; the data also helps scientists predict how sea levels may change in the future. These data reveal that sea levels fluctuated, sometimes dramatically, throughout Earth's history due to natural glacial cycles. Yet, for the previous 2,000 or so years, global sea level changed only a few centimeters each century.\nBut humans began driving up concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and Earth\u2019s temperatures. That activity is the primary cause of the sea level rise that\u2019s occurred since the 1800s, and that will happen well into the future.\nSea levels do not rise uniformly around the globe. Some coastal areas are already experiencing rapid rates of change, while other regions are slower to experience significant impacts.\nAs with land, the global height of the sea is uneven; levels vary around the world due to physical factors such as massive ocean currents and prevailing wind directions. The rate of current sea level rise is driven by these two factors, in addition to human and climate-driven changes like thermal expansion, coastal erosion, and whether the land is sinking or rebounding.\nFor example, warm water occupies more space than cold water, yet the ocean isn\u2019t warming at the same pace everywhere. So sea levels rise faster in ocean regions that are warming more rapidly. Sea level rise is also accelerating in places like the Gulf of Mexico because the land is slowly settling due to excessive oil and water extraction.\nWhile sea level rise occurs unevenly, it will eventually impact most coastal areas. Scientists continually refine their projections of future sea level rise to determine which coastal areas will be affected first.\nSea level rise is one of the most urgent climate threats, and many low-lying islands and coastal areas already experience its impacts. Rising seas make hurricanes and other storms more dangerous through higher storm surges and flooding. As higher seas and related flooding erode and inundate islands and coastlines worldwide, infrastructure and livelihoods will be lost, and vast swaths of land will become uninhabitable.\nAbout 10 percent of the world's population, roughly 770 million people, live in coastal areas less than 5 meters above the high tide line. Rising seas could force as many as 100 million of them to migrate due to rising seas by the end of the 21st century.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that global sea levels could rise between 1.4 and 2.7 feet by 2100, compared to the average 1986-2005 sea level. Hotter ocean temperatures drive sea level rise; just how much sea level rise occurs depends on how much the planet warms.\nSea levels will\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Changes to Earth\u2019s climate driven by increased human emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases are already having widespread effects on the environment: glaciers and ice sheets are shrinking, river and lake ice is breaking up earlier, plant and animal geographic ranges are shifting, and plants and trees are blooming sooner.\nEffects that scientists had long predicted would result from global climate change are now occurring, such as sea ice loss, accelerated sea level rise, and longer, more intense heat waves.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nSome changes (such as droughts, wildfires, and extreme rainfall) are happening faster than scientists previously assessed. In fact, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) \u2014 the United Nations body established to assess the science related to climate change \u2014 modern humans have never before seen the observed changes in our global climate, and some of these changes are irreversible over the next hundreds to thousands of years.\nScientists have high confidence that global temperatures will continue to rise for many decades, mainly due to greenhouse gases produced by human activities.\nThe IPCC\u2019s Sixth Assessment report, published in 2021, found that human emissions of heat-trapping gases have already warmed the climate by nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius) since 1850-1900.1 The global average temperature is expected to reach or exceed 1.5 degrees C (about 3 degrees F) within the next few decades. These changes will affect all regions of Earth.\nThe severity of effects caused by climate change will depend on the path of future human activities. More greenhouse gas emissions will lead to more climate extremes and widespread damaging effects across our planet. However, those future effects depend on the total amount of carbon dioxide we emit. So, if we can reduce emissions, we may avoid some of the worst effects.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nHere are some of the expected effects of global climate change on the United States, according to the Third and Fourth National Climate Assessment Reports:\nGlobal sea level has risen about 8 inches (0.2 meters) since reliable record-keeping began in 1880. By 2100, scientists project that it will rise at least another foot (0.3 meters), but possibly as high as 6.6 feet (2 meters) in a high-emissions scenario. Sea level is rising because of added water from melting land ice and the expansion of seawater as it warms.

Image credit: Khagani Hasanov, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0\nScientists project that hurricane-associated storm intensity and rainfall rates will increase as the climate continues to warm. Image credit: NASA\nDroughts in the Southwest and heat waves (periods of abnormally hot weather lasting days to weeks) are projected to become more intense, and cold waves less intense and less frequent. Image credit: NOAA\nWarming temperatures have extended and intensified wildfire season in the West, where long-term drought in the region has heightened the risk of fires. Scientists estimate that human-caused climate change has already doubled the area of forest burned in recent decades. By around 2050, the amount of land consumed by wildfires in Western states is projected to further increase by two to six times. Even in traditionally rainy regions like the Southeast, wildfires are projected to increase by about 30%.\nClimate change is having an uneven effect on precipitation (rain and snow) in the United States, with some locations experiencing increased precipitation and flooding, while others suffer from drought. On average, more winter and spring precipitation is projected for the northern United States, and less for the Southwest, over this century. Image credit: Marvin Nauman/FEMA\nThe length of the frost-free season, and the corresponding growing season, has been increasing since the 1980s, with the largest increases occurring in the western United States. Across the United States, the growing season is projected to continue to lengthen, which will affect ecosystems and agriculture.\nSummer of 2023 was Earth's hottest summer on record, 0.41 degrees Fahrenheit (F) (0.23 degrees Celsius (C)) warmer than any other summer in NASA\u2019s record and 2.1 degrees F (1.2 C) warmer than the average summer between 1951 and 1980. Image credit: NASA\nSea ice cover in the Arctic Ocean is expected to continue decreasing, and the Arctic Ocean will very likely become essentially ice-free in late summer if current projections hold. This change is expected to occur before mid-century.\nClimate change is bringing different types of challenges to each region of the country. Some of the current and future impacts are summarized below.

It involved a team of 54 scientists from seven countries and 31 institutes.\nAbout 90% of the excess heat from global warming is stored in the ocean, making ocean heat content a critical indicator of climate change. From 2023 to 2024, the global upper 2000 m ocean heat content increase is 16 zettajoules (1021 Joules), about 140 times the world\u2019s total electricity generation in 2023, according to the study, which is based on the Insitute of Atmospheric Physics dataset.\nWMO will provide full details of key climate change indicators, including greenhouse gases, surface temperatures, ocean heat, sea level rise, glacier retreat and sea ice extent, in its State of the Global Climate 2024 report to be issued in March 2025. This will also give details of high-impact events.\nMr Guterres called on governments to deliver new national climate action plans this year to limit long-term global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C, and support the most vulnerable deal with devastating climate impacts.\nOne or more individual years exceeding 1.5\u00b0C does not mean that we have missed the goal of \u201cholding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change\u201d as stated in the Paris Agreement. This refers to an extended period, typically decades or longer, although the Agreement itself does not provide a specific definition.\nShort-term temperature spikes in long-term warming can be caused by naturally occurring phenomena like El Ni\u00f1o, which persisted from mid-2023 to May 2024.\nAs global warming continues, there is an urgent need for careful tracking, monitoring and communication with regard to where the warming is relative to the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement, to help policymakers in their deliberations.\nAn international team of experts established by WMO has given an initial indication that long-term global warming as assessed in 2024 is currently about 1.3\u00b0C compared to the 1850-1900 baseline.\nWMO uses datasets based on climatological data from observing sites and ships and buoys in global marine networks, developed and maintained by the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (NASA GISS), the United Kingdom\u2019s Met Office Hadley Centre and the University of East Anglia\u2019s Climatic Research Unit (HadCRUT), and the Berkeley Earth group.\nWMO also uses reanalysis datasets from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and its Copernicus Climate Change Service, and the Japan Meteor\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Both factors are the result of increasing human greenhouse gas emissions driving Earth\u2019s temperatures higher.\nIf the planet surpasses 1.5\u20132\u00b0C of warming, irreversible impacts such as melting ice and sea level rise will significantly impact human and environmental sustainability.\nEarth has warmed 1\u00b0C (2\u00b0F) since 1880. The ocean\u2019s surface temperature rose about 1.5\u00b0F in that time because it absorbs more than 90 percent of the excess heat greenhouse gases trap in the atmosphere. Warmer water takes up more space, and this increase in volume\u2014the thermal expansion of water\u2014was sea level rise\u2019s main culprit over the last century.\nMeltwater from the world\u2019s diminishing ice sheets and glaciers also drives sea levels up, and it is now the main contributor to global sea level rise. Hotter air temperatures melt the surface of the ice while warmer ocean water erodes ice shelves from the sides and below, allowing more ice and meltwater to flow into the sea.\nThe Greenland ice sheet, the world\u2019s largest, is melting four times faster than it did in 2003 and is responsible for 20 percent of current sea level rise. The IPCC projects that by 2100, Greenland could contribute 3.1 to 10.6 inches (8 to 27 cm) to global sea level, and the melting of Antarctic ice may add another 1.2 to 11 inches (3 to 28 cm).\nAnother factor in rising sea levels is subsistence, when land sinks or settles due to natural geologic processes and human-made factors such as pumping water out of aquifers. The combined effects of coastal subsistence and rising seas worsen flooding and threaten densely-populated cities worldwide.\nLand is gradually rising in some parts of the world due to processes like the long-term rebound of land after losing the weight of ancient ice sheets. In parts of Canada, for example, the land is rising several millimeters each year. Rebounding land can make sea levels appear to increase more slowly, but it doesn\u2019t change or offset rising seas.\nData collected by a global network of tidal stations and sensors on satellites reveal local and global sea levels are rapidly rising.\nTide stations use GPS to monitor local sea levels around the world. Before GPS, an array of tide gauges collected the same data going back more than 200 years ago in some locations. Scientists began to use satellites to measure changes to the average height of global sea levels in the 1990s; they also use laser altimeters affixed to satellites to monitor changes in the size of ice sheets and glaciers and understand how this activity contributes to rising seas.\nScientists also take ocean temperature measurements from research vessels and using buoys and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs). By monitoring ocean heat, researchers learn how much thermal expansion might contribute to sea level rise. Together, satellite and tide station measurements show the rate of sea level rise has more than doubled since the start of the twentieth century to about .14 inches a year.\nHistorical, or proxy, information contained deep-sea sediments and cores of ancient ice enables scientists to reconstruct and understand how sea levels rose and fell in the past; the data also helps scientists predict how sea levels may change in the future. These data reveal that sea levels fluctuated, sometimes dramatically, throughout Earth's history due to natural glacial cycles. Yet, for the previous 2,000 or so years, global sea level changed only a few centimeters each century.\nBut humans began driving up concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and Earth\u2019s temperatures. That activity is the primary cause of the sea level rise that\u2019s occurred since the 1800s, and that will happen well into the future.\nSea levels do not rise uniformly around the globe. Some coastal areas are already experiencing rapid rates of change, while other regions are slower to experience significant impacts.\nAs with land, the global height of the sea is uneven; levels vary around the world due to physical factors such as massive ocean currents and prevailing wind directions. The rate of current sea level rise is driven by these two factors, in addition to human and climate-driven changes like thermal expansion, coastal erosion, and whether the land is sinking or rebounding.\nFor example, warm water occupies more space than cold water, yet the ocean isn\u2019t warming at the same pace everywhere. So sea levels rise faster in ocean regions that are warming more rapidly. Sea level rise is also accelerating in places like the Gulf of Mexico because the land is slowly settling due to excessive oil and water extraction.\nWhile sea level rise occurs unevenly, it will eventually impact most coastal areas. Scientists continually refine their projections of future sea level rise to determine which coastal areas will be affected first.\nSea level rise is one of the most urgent climate threats, and many low-lying islands and coastal areas already experience its impacts. Rising seas make hurricanes and other storms more dangerous through higher storm surges and flooding. As higher seas and related flooding erode and inundate islands and coastlines worldwide, infrastructure and livelihoods will be lost, and vast swaths of land will become uninhabitable.\nAbout 10 percent of the world's population, roughly 770 million people, live in coastal areas less than 5 meters above the high tide line. Rising seas could force as many as 100 million of them to migrate due to rising seas by the end of the 21st century.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that global sea levels could rise between 1.4 and 2.7 feet by 2100, compared to the average 1986-2005 sea level. Hotter ocean temperatures drive sea level rise; just how much sea level rise occurs depends on how much the planet warms.\nSea levels will\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Changes to Earth\u2019s climate driven by increased human emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases are already having widespread effects on the environment: glaciers and ice sheets are shrinking, river and lake ice is breaking up earlier, plant and animal geographic ranges are shifting, and plants and trees are blooming sooner.\nEffects that scientists had long predicted would result from global climate change are now occurring, such as sea ice loss, accelerated sea level rise, and longer, more intense heat waves.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nSome changes (such as droughts, wildfires, and extreme rainfall) are happening faster than scientists previously assessed. In fact, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) \u2014 the United Nations body established to assess the science related to climate change \u2014 modern humans have never before seen the observed changes in our global climate, and some of these changes are irreversible over the next hundreds to thousands of years.\nScientists have high confidence that global temperatures will continue to rise for many decades, mainly due to greenhouse gases produced by human activities.\nThe IPCC\u2019s Sixth Assessment report, published in 2021, found that human emissions of heat-trapping gases have already warmed the climate by nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius) since 1850-1900.1 The global average temperature is expected to reach or exceed 1.5 degrees C (about 3 degrees F) within the next few decades. These changes will affect all regions of Earth.\nThe severity of effects caused by climate change will depend on the path of future human activities. More greenhouse gas emissions will lead to more climate extremes and widespread damaging effects across our planet. However, those future effects depend on the total amount of carbon dioxide we emit. So, if we can reduce emissions, we may avoid some of the worst effects.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nHere are some of the expected effects of global climate change on the United States, according to the Third and Fourth National Climate Assessment Reports:\nGlobal sea level has risen about 8 inches (0.2 meters) since reliable record-keeping began in 1880. By 2100, scientists project that it will rise at least another foot (0.3 meters), but possibly as high as 6.6 feet (2 meters) in a high-emissions scenario. Sea level is rising because of added water from melting land ice and the expansion of seawater as it warms.

Image credit: Khagani Hasanov, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0\nScientists project that hurricane-associated storm intensity and rainfall rates will increase as the climate continues to warm. Image credit: NASA\nDroughts in the Southwest and heat waves (periods of abnormally hot weather lasting days to weeks) are projected to become more intense, and cold waves less intense and less frequent. Image credit: NOAA\nWarming temperatures have extended and intensified wildfire season in the West, where long-term drought in the region has heightened the risk of fires. Scientists estimate that human-caused climate change has already doubled the area of forest burned in recent decades. By around 2050, the amount of land consumed by wildfires in Western states is projected to further increase by two to six times. Even in traditionally rainy regions like the Southeast, wildfires are projected to increase by about 30%.\nClimate change is having an uneven effect on precipitation (rain and snow) in the United States, with some locations experiencing increased precipitation and flooding, while others suffer from drought. On average, more winter and spring precipitation is projected for the northern United States, and less for the Southwest, over this century. Image credit: Marvin Nauman/FEMA\nThe length of the frost-free season, and the corresponding growing season, has been increasing since the 1980s, with the largest increases occurring in the western United States. Across the United States, the growing season is projected to continue to lengthen, which will affect ecosystems and agriculture.\nSummer of 2023 was Earth's hottest summer on record, 0.41 degrees Fahrenheit (F) (0.23 degrees Celsius (C)) warmer than any other summer in NASA\u2019s record and 2.1 degrees F (1.2 C) warmer than the average summer between 1951 and 1980. Image credit: NASA\nSea ice cover in the Arctic Ocean is expected to continue decreasing, and the Arctic Ocean will very likely become essentially ice-free in late summer if current projections hold. This change is expected to occur before mid-century.\nClimate change is bringing different types of challenges to each region of the country. Some of the current and future impacts are summarized below.

The IPCC projects that by 2100, Greenland could contribute 3.1 to 10.6 inches (8 to 27 cm) to global sea level, and the melting of Antarctic ice may add another 1.2 to 11 inches (3 to 28 cm).\nAnother factor in rising sea levels is subsistence, when land sinks or settles due to natural geologic processes and human-made factors such as pumping water out of aquifers. The combined effects of coastal subsistence and rising seas worsen flooding and threaten densely-populated cities worldwide.\nLand is gradually rising in some parts of the world due to processes like the long-term rebound of land after losing the weight of ancient ice sheets.

Both factors are the result of increasing human greenhouse gas emissions driving Earth\u2019s temperatures higher.\nIf the planet surpasses 1.5\u20132\u00b0C of warming, irreversible impacts such as melting ice and sea level rise will significantly impact human and environmental sustainability.\nEarth has warmed 1\u00b0C (2\u00b0F) since 1880. The ocean\u2019s surface temperature rose about 1.5\u00b0F in that time because it absorbs more than 90 percent of the excess heat greenhouse gases trap in the atmosphere. Warmer water takes up more space, and this increase in volume\u2014the thermal expansion of water\u2014was sea level rise\u2019s main culprit over the last century.\nMeltwater from the world\u2019s diminishing ice sheets and glaciers also drives sea levels up, and it is now the main contributor to global sea level rise. Hotter air temperatures melt the surface of the ice while warmer ocean water erodes ice shelves from the sides and below, allowing more ice and meltwater to flow into the sea.\nThe Greenland ice sheet, the world\u2019s largest, is melting four times faster than it did in 2003 and is responsible for 20 percent of current sea level rise. The IPCC projects that by 2100, Greenland could contribute 3.1 to 10.6 inches (8 to 27 cm) to global sea level, and the melting of Antarctic ice may add another 1.2 to 11 inches (3 to 28 cm).\nAnother factor in rising sea levels is subsistence, when land sinks or settles due to natural geologic processes and human-made factors such as pumping water out of aquifers. The combined effects of coastal subsistence and rising seas worsen flooding and threaten densely-populated cities worldwide.\nLand is gradually rising in some parts of the world due to processes like the long-term rebound of land after losing the weight of ancient ice sheets. In parts of Canada, for example, the land is rising several millimeters each year. Rebounding land can make sea levels appear to increase more slowly, but it doesn\u2019t change or offset rising seas.\nData collected by a global network of tidal stations and sensors on satellites reveal local and global sea levels are rapidly rising.\nTide stations use GPS to monitor local sea levels around the world. Before GPS, an array of tide gauges collected the same data going back more than 200 years ago in some locations. Scientists began to use satellites to measure changes to the average height of global sea levels in the 1990s; they also use laser altimeters affixed to satellites to monitor changes in the size of ice sheets and glaciers and understand how this activity contributes to rising seas.\nScientists also take ocean temperature measurements from research vessels and using buoys and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs). By monitoring ocean heat, researchers learn how much thermal expansion might contribute to sea level rise. Together, satellite and tide station measurements show the rate of sea level rise has more than doubled since the start of the twentieth century to about .14 inches a year.\nHistorical, or proxy, information contained deep-sea sediments and cores of ancient ice enables scientists to reconstruct and understand how sea levels rose and fell in the past; the data also helps scientists predict how sea levels may change in the future. These data reveal that sea levels fluctuated, sometimes dramatically, throughout Earth's history due to natural glacial cycles. Yet, for the previous 2,000 or so years, global sea level changed only a few centimeters each century.\nBut humans began driving up concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and Earth\u2019s temperatures. That activity is the primary cause of the sea level rise that\u2019s occurred since the 1800s, and that will happen well into the future.\nSea levels do not rise uniformly around the globe. Some coastal areas are already experiencing rapid rates of change, while other regions are slower to experience significant impacts.\nAs with land, the global height of the sea is uneven; levels vary around the world due to physical factors such as massive ocean currents and prevailing wind directions. The rate of current sea level rise is driven by these two factors, in addition to human and climate-driven changes like thermal expansion, coastal erosion, and whether the land is sinking or rebounding.\nFor example, warm water occupies more space than cold water, yet the ocean isn\u2019t warming at the same pace everywhere. So sea levels rise faster in ocean regions that are warming more rapidly. Sea level rise is also accelerating in places like the Gulf of Mexico because the land is slowly settling due to excessive oil and water extraction.\nWhile sea level rise occurs unevenly, it will eventually impact most coastal areas.

Evidence-based decision-making needs to be informed by up-to-date and timely information on key indicators of the state of the climate system and of the human influence on the global climate system. However, successive IPCC reports are published at intervals of 5\u201310 years, creating potential for an information gap between report cycles.\nWe follow methods as close as possible to those used in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) Working Group One (WGI) report. We compile monitoring datasets to produce estimates for key climate indicators related to forcing of the climate system: emissions of greenhouse gases and short-lived climate forcers, greenhouse gas concentrations, radiative forcing, the Earth's energy imbalance, surface temperature changes, warming attributed to human activities, the remaining carbon budget, and estimates of global temperature extremes. The purpose of this effort, grounded in an open-data, open-science approach, is to make annually updated reliable global climate indicators available in the public domain (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11388387, Smith et al., 2024a). As they are traceable to IPCC report methods, they can be trusted by all parties involved in UNFCCC negotiations and help convey wider understanding of the latest knowledge of the climate system and its direction of travel.\nThe indicators show that, for the 2014\u20132023 decade average, observed warming was 1.19 [1.06 to 1.30] \u00b0C, of which 1.19 [1.0 to 1.4] \u00b0C was human-induced. For the single-year average, human-induced warming reached 1.31 [1.1 to 1.7] \u00b0C in 2023 relative to 1850\u20131900. The best estimate is below the 2023-observed warming record of 1.43 [1.32 to 1.53] \u00b0C, indicating a substantial contribution of internal variability in the 2023 record. Human-induced warming has been increasing at a rate that is unprecedented in the instrumental record, reaching 0.26 [0.2\u20130.4] \u00b0C per decade over 2014\u20132023. This high rate of warming is caused by a combination of net greenhouse gas emissions being at a persistent high of 53\u00b15.4 Gt CO2e yr\u22121 over the last decade, as well as reductions in the strength of aerosol cooling. Despite this, there is evidence that the rate of increase in CO2 emissions over the last decade has slowed compared to the 2000s, and depending on societal choices, a continued series of these annual updates over the critical 2020s decade could track a change of direction for some of the indicators presented here.\nThe IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) provided an assessment of human influence on key indicators of the state of climate grounded in data up to the year 2019 (IPCC, 2021a, Supplement Sect. S1). The next IPCC assessment report, AR7, is due towards the end of the decade. Given the speed of recent change, and the need for updated climate knowledge to inform evidence-based decision-making, the Indicators of Global Climate Change (IGCC) was initiated to provide policymakers with annual updates of the latest scientific understanding on the state of selected critical indicators of the climate system and of human influence.\nThis second annual update follows broadly the format of last year (Forster et al., 2023), focussing on indicators related to heating of the climate system, building from greenhouse gas emissions towards estimates of human-induced warming and the remaining carbon budget. Figure 1 presents an overview of the aspects assessed and their interlinkages from cause (emissions) through effect (changes in physical indicators) to climatic impact drivers. It also provides a visual roadmap as to the structure of remaining sections in this paper to guide the reader.\nFigure 1The flow chart of data production from emissions to human-induced warming and the remaining carbon budget, illustrating both the rationale and workflow within the paper production.\nDownload\nThe update is based on methodologies assessed by the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the physical science basis of climate change (Working Group One (WGI) report; IPCC, 2021a) as well as Chap. 2 of the WGIII report (Dhakal et al., 2022) and is aligned with the efforts initiated in AR6 to implement FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles for reproducibility and reusability (Pirani et al., 2022; Iturbide et al., 2022). IPCC reports make a much wider assessment of the science and methodologies \u2013 we do not attempt to reproduce the comprehensive nature of these IPCC assessments here. As such, we do not consider adopting fundamentally different approaches to AR6. Rather, our aim is to rigorously track both climate system change and evolving methodological improvements between IPCC report cycles, thereby achieving transparency and consistency in between successive reports.\nThe update is organised as follows: emissions (Sect. 2) and greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations (Sect. 3) are used to develop updated estimates of effective radiative forcing (Sect. 4). Earth's energy imbalance (Sect. 5) and observations of global surface temperature change (Sect. 6) are key global indicators of a warming world. The contributions to global surface temperature change from human and natural influences are formally attributed in Sect. 7, which tracks the level and rate of human-induced warming. Section 8 updates the remaining carbon budget to policy-relevant temperature thresholds. Section 9 gives an example of global-scale indicators associated with climate extremes of maximum land surface temperatures. An important purpose of the exercise is to make these indicators widely available and understood. Code and data availability is given in Sect. 10, and conclusions are presented in Sect. 11.

On the one hand, we have the greenhouse effect to thank for the presence of life on earth; without it, our planet would be cold and unlivable.\nBut beginning in the mid- to late-19th century, human activity began pushing the greenhouse effect to new levels. The result? A planet that\u2019s warmer right now than at any other point in human history, and getting ever warmer. This global warming has, in turn, dramatically altered natural cycles and weather patterns, with impacts that include extreme heat, protracted drought, increased flooding, more intense storms, and rising sea levels. Taken together, these miserable and sometimes deadly effects are what have come to be known as climate change.\nDetailing and discussing the human causes of climate change isn\u2019t about shaming people, or trying to make them feel guilty for their choices. It\u2019s about defining the problem so that we can arrive at effective solutions. And we must honestly address its origins\u2014even though it can sometimes be difficult, or even uncomfortable, to do so. Human civilization has made extraordinary productivity leaps, some of which have led to our currently overheated planet. But by harnessing that same ability to innovate and attaching it to a renewed sense of shared responsibility, we can find ways to cool the planet down, fight climate change, and chart a course toward a more just, equitable, and sustainable future.\nHere\u2019s a rough breakdown of the factors that are driving climate change.\nSome amount of climate change can be attributed to natural phenomena. Over the course of Earth\u2019s existence, volcanic eruptions, fluctuations in solar radiation, tectonic shifts, and even small changes in our orbit have all had observable effects on planetary warming and cooling patterns.\nBut climate records are able to show that today\u2019s global warming\u2014particularly what has occured since the start of the industrial revolution\u2014is happening much, much faster than ever before. According to NASA, \u201c[t]hese natural causes are still in play today, but their influence is too small or they occur too slowly to explain the rapid warming seen in recent decades.\u201d And the records refute the misinformation that natural causes are the main culprits behind climate change, as some in the fossil fuel industry and conservative think tanks would like us to believe.\nChemical manufacturing plants emit fumes along Onondaga Lake in Solvay, New York, in the late-19th century. Over time, industrial development severely polluted the local area.\nLibrary of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division, Detroit Publishing Company Collection\nScientists agree that human activity is the primary driver of what we\u2019re seeing now worldwide. (This type of climate change is sometimes referred to as anthropogenic, which is just a way of saying \u201ccaused by human beings.\u201d) The unchecked burning of fossil fuels over the past 150 years has drastically increased the presence of atmospheric greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide. At the same time, logging and development have led to the widespread destruction of forests, wetlands, and other carbon sinks\u2014natural resources that store carbon dioxide and prevent it from being released into the atmosphere.\nRight now, atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide are the highest they\u2019ve been in the last 800,000 years. Some greenhouse gases, like hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HFCs), do not even exist in nature. By continuously pumping these gases into the air, we helped raise the earth\u2019s average temperature by about 1.9 degrees Fahrenheit during the 20th century\u2014which has brought us to our current era of deadly, and increasingly routine, weather extremes. And it\u2019s important to note that while climate change affects everyone in some way, it doesn\u2019t do so equally: All over the world, people of color and those living in economically disadvantaged or politically marginalized communities bear a much larger burden, despite the fact that these communities play a much smaller role in warming the planet.\nOur ways of generating power for electricity, heat, and transportation, our built environment and industries, our ways of interacting with the land, and our consumption habits together serve as the primary drivers of climate change. While the percentages of greenhouse gases stemming from each source may fluctuate, the sources themselves remain relatively consistent.\nTraffic on Interstate 25 in Denver\nDavid Parsons/iStock\nThe cars, trucks, ships, and planes that we use to transport ourselves and our goods are a major source of global greenhouse gas emissions. (In the United States, they actually constitute the single-largest source.) Burning petroleum-based fuel in combustion engines releases massive amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Passenger cars account for 41 percent of those emissions, with the typical passenger vehicle emitting about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. And trucks are by far the worst polluters on the road. They run almost constantly and largely burn diesel fuel, which is why, despite accounting for just 4 percent of U.S. vehicles, trucks emit 23 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions from transportation.\nWe can get these numbers down, but we need large-scale investments to get more zero-emission vehicles on the road and increase access to reliable public transit.\nAs of 2021, nearly 60 per\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The purpose of this effort, grounded in an open-data, open-science approach, is to make annually updated reliable global climate indicators available in the public domain (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11388387, Smith et al., 2024a).

This high rate of warming is caused by a combination of net greenhouse gas emissions being at a persistent high of 53\u00b15.4 Gt CO2e yr\u22121 over the last decade, as well as reductions in the strength of aerosol cooling. Despite this, there is evidence that the rate of increase in CO2 emissions over the last decade has slowed compared to the 2000s, and depending on societal choices, a continued series of these annual updates over the critical 2020s decade could track a change of direction for some of the indicators presented here.\nThe IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) provided an assessment of human influence on key indicators of the state of climate grounded in data up to the year 2019 (IPCC, 2021a, Supplement Sect.

Changes to Earth\u2019s climate driven by increased human emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases are already having widespread effects on the environment: glaciers and ice sheets are shrinking, river and lake ice is breaking up earlier, plant and animal geographic ranges are shifting, and plants and trees are blooming sooner.\nEffects that scientists had long predicted would result from global climate change are now occurring, such as sea ice loss, accelerated sea level rise, and longer, more intense heat waves.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nSome changes (such as droughts, wildfires, and extreme rainfall) are happening faster than scientists previously assessed. In fact, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) \u2014 the United Nations body established to assess the science related to climate change \u2014 modern humans have never before seen the observed changes in our global climate, and some of these changes are irreversible over the next hundreds to thousands of years.\nScientists have high confidence that global temperatures will continue to rise for many decades, mainly due to greenhouse gases produced by human activities.\nThe IPCC\u2019s Sixth Assessment report, published in 2021, found that human emissions of heat-trapping gases have already warmed the climate by nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius) since 1850-1900.1 The global average temperature is expected to reach or exceed 1.5 degrees C (about 3 degrees F) within the next few decades. These changes will affect all regions of Earth.\nThe severity of effects caused by climate change will depend on the path of future human activities. More greenhouse gas emissions will lead to more climate extremes and widespread damaging effects across our planet. However, those future effects depend on the total amount of carbon dioxide we emit. So, if we can reduce emissions, we may avoid some of the worst effects.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nHere are some of the expected effects of global climate change on the United States, according to the Third and Fourth National Climate Assessment Reports:\nGlobal sea level has risen about 8 inches (0.2 meters) since reliable record-keeping began in 1880. By 2100, scientists project that it will rise at least another foot (0.3 meters), but possibly as high as 6.6 feet (2 meters) in a high-emissions scenario. Sea level is rising because of added water from melting land ice and the expansion of seawater as it warms.

Image credit: Khagani Hasanov, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0\nScientists project that hurricane-associated storm intensity and rainfall rates will increase as the climate continues to warm. Image credit: NASA\nDroughts in the Southwest and heat waves (periods of abnormally hot weather lasting days to weeks) are projected to become more intense, and cold waves less intense and less frequent. Image credit: NOAA\nWarming temperatures have extended and intensified wildfire season in the West, where long-term drought in the region has heightened the risk of fires. Scientists estimate that human-caused climate change has already doubled the area of forest burned in recent decades. By around 2050, the amount of land consumed by wildfires in Western states is projected to further increase by two to six times. Even in traditionally rainy regions like the Southeast, wildfires are projected to increase by about 30%.\nClimate change is having an uneven effect on precipitation (rain and snow) in the United States, with some locations experiencing increased precipitation and flooding, while others suffer from drought. On average, more winter and spring precipitation is projected for the northern United States, and less for the Southwest, over this century. Image credit: Marvin Nauman/FEMA\nThe length of the frost-free season, and the corresponding growing season, has been increasing since the 1980s, with the largest increases occurring in the western United States. Across the United States, the growing season is projected to continue to lengthen, which will affect ecosystems and agriculture.\nSummer of 2023 was Earth's hottest summer on record, 0.41 degrees Fahrenheit (F) (0.23 degrees Celsius (C)) warmer than any other summer in NASA\u2019s record and 2.1 degrees F (1.2 C) warmer than the average summer between 1951 and 1980. Image credit: NASA\nSea ice cover in the Arctic Ocean is expected to continue decreasing, and the Arctic Ocean will very likely become essentially ice-free in late summer if current projections hold. This change is expected to occur before mid-century.\nClimate change is bringing different types of challenges to each region of the country.

Blue bars indicate cooler-than-average years; red bars show warmer-than-average years. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Information.\nAccording to the annual report from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, 2024 was the warmest year since global records began in 1850. The global average surface temperature was 2.32 Fahrenheit (1.29 degrees Celsius) above the 20th-century average (57.0 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.9 degrees Celsius) and 2.63 degrees Fahrenheit (1.46 degrees Celsius) above the pre-industrial average (56.7 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.7 degrees Celsius), which NOAA defines as the period from 1850-1900.\nGlobal temperatures in 2024 were above the 1991-2020 average (red) across most of the planet. Yearly temperatures compared to the 20th-century average (bar chart) show that it has been 48 years since Earth had a cooler-than-average year. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe 2024 global temperature anomaly (anomaly means \u201cdifference from average\u201d) is 0.18 degrees F (0.10 degrees C) warmer than the previous record, set the year before, in 2023. The ten warmest years in the 175-year record have all occurred during the last decade (2015\u20132024). When the new century started in 2000, the first year to set a new high-temperature record was 2005. Now, 2005 is just the 13th-warmest year on record.\nOther 2024 rankings included...\nFor more regional details and 2024 climate statistics, see the 2024 Global Climate Report from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe global average surface temperature is an indicator of the state of Earth\u2019s energy balance: how much sunlight it absorbs minus how much heat it radiates back to space. When these amounts are the same, Earth\u2019s average surface temperature remains steady. When they are out of balance, Earth cools or warms. Earth\u2019s average surface temperature has been rising because human-produced greenhouse gases are causing Earth to absorb more energy than it radiates back to space.\nGiven the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of added heat energy to raise Earth\u2019s average surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree-Fahrenheit (1-degree-Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1850-1900 in NOAA's record) might seem small, but it represents a significant increase in heat energy circulating through all parts of the Earth system, including the oceans, frozen landscapes, and the atmosphere.\nBeyond being an indicator of changes in Earth\u2019s energy balance, surface temperature matters because it controls many environmental and ecological processes that are important to humans and other life, including the water cycle (evaporation, clouds, surface water supplies, and precipitation), the carbon cycle, and the kinds of plants, animals, and other living things that can survive in different places on Earth.\nThe concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (55 degrees Celsius) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the \"average\" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget, which can only be directly measured from space.\nTo calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute temperature readings to temperature anomalies\u2014the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend.\nAcross inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and known physical relationships\u2014such as the way temperature decreases with altitude\u2014to estimate the missing values. Each value is then used to calculate a global-scale temperature anomaly. This process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in Earth's surface temperature over time. Read more about how the global surface temperature record is built in our Climate Data Primer.\nTemperature change has not been uniform across the planet, but more areas are warming than cooling. And the rate of warming has accelerated in recent decades. According to NOAA's 2024 Annual Climate Report the combined land and ocean temperature has warmed at an average rate of 0.11 degrees Fahrenheit (0.06 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1850 and more than three times that rate (0.36 degrees Fahrenheit, or 0.20 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1975.\nRecent rates of global warming (1994-2024, bottom) are larger than the longer-term average rates (1901-2024, top). Places that have cooled are colored blue; places that have warmed are colored yellow, orange, or red. In the past three decades, many places in the Northern Hemisphere have warmed by 1 degree Fahrenheit or more per decade. Differences are most dramatic in the Arctic. With the decline of ice and snow, the Arctic reflects less incoming sunlight, which amplifies the rate of greenhouse-gas-driven warming. NOAA Climate.gov, based o\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The past ten years have all been in the Top Ten, in an extraordinary streak of record-breaking temperatures.\nThe global average surface temperature was 1.55 \u00b0C (with a margin of uncertainty of \u00b1 0.13 \u00b0C) above the 1850-1900 average, according to WMO\u2019s consolidated analysis of the six datasets. This means that we have likely just experienced the first calendar year with a global mean temperature of more than 1.5\u00b0C above the 1850-1900 average.\n\u201cToday\u2019s assessment from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) proves yet again \u2013 global heating is a cold, hard fact,\u201d said UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3no Guterres.\n\u201cIndividual years pushing past the 1.5 degree limit do not mean the long-term goal is shot. It means we need to fight even harder to get on track. Blazing temperatures in 2024 require trail-blazing climate action in 2025,\u201d he said. \u201cThere's still time to avoid the worst of climate catastrophe. But leaders must act \u2013 now,\u201d he said.\nThe WMO provides a temperature assessment based on multiple sources of data to support international climate monitoring and to provide authoritative information for the UN Climate Change negotiating process. The datasets are from the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), Japan Meteorological Agency, NASA, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the UK\u2019s Met Office in collaboration with the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia (HadCRUT), and Berkeley Earth.\n\u201cClimate history is playing out before our eyes. We\u2019ve had not just one or two record-breaking years, but a full ten-year series. This has been accompanied by devastating and extreme weather, rising sea levels and melting ice, all powered by record-breaking greenhouse gas levels due to human activities,\u201d said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo.\n\u201cIt is important to emphasize that a single year of more than 1.5\u00b0C for a year does NOT mean that we have failed to meet Paris Agreement long-term temperature goals, which are measured over decades rather than an individual year. However, it is essential to recognize that every fraction of a degree of warming matters. Whether it is at a level below or above 1.5\u00b0C of warming, every additional increment of global warming increases the impacts on our lives, economies and our planet,\u201d said Celeste Saulo.\nThere is a margin of uncertainty in all temperature assessments. All six datasets place 2024 as the warmest year on record and all highlight the recent rate of warming. But not all show the temperature anomaly above 1.5 \u00b0C due to differing methodologies.\nThe timing of the release of the six temperature datasets was coordinated across the institutions in order to underline the exceptional conditions experienced during 2024.\nA separate study published in Advances in Atmospheric Sciences found that ocean warming in 2024 played a key role in the record high temperatures. The ocean is the warmest it has ever been as recorded by humans, not only at the surface but also for the upper 2000 meters, according to the study led by Prof. Lijing Cheng with the Institute of Atmospheric Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It involved a team of 54 scientists from seven countries and 31 institutes.\nAbout 90% of the excess heat from global warming is stored in the ocean, making ocean heat content a critical indicator of climate change. From 2023 to 2024, the global upper 2000 m ocean heat content increase is 16 zettajoules (1021 Joules), about 140 times the world\u2019s total electricity generation in 2023, according to the study, which is based on the Insitute of Atmospheric Physics dataset.\nWMO will provide full details of key climate change indicators, including greenhouse gases, surface temperatures, ocean heat, sea level rise, glacier retreat and sea ice extent, in its State of the Global Climate 2024 report to be issued in March 2025. This will also give details of high-impact events.\nMr Guterres called on governments to deliver new national climate action plans this year to limit long-term global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C, and support the most vulnerable deal with devastating climate impacts.\nOne or more individual years exceeding 1.5\u00b0C does not mean that we have missed the goal of \u201cholding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change\u201d as stated in the Paris Agreement. This refers to an extended period, typically decades or longer, although the Agreement itself does not provide a specific definition.\nShort-term temperature spikes in long-term warming can be caused by naturally occurring phenomena like El Ni\u00f1o, which persisted from mid-2023 to May 2024.\nAs global warming continues, there is an urgent need for careful tracking, monitoring and communication with regard to where the warming is relative to the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement, to help policymakers in their deliberations.\nAn international team of experts established by WMO has given an initial indication that long-term global warming as assessed in 2024 is currently about 1.3\u00b0C compared to the 1850-1900 baseline.\nWMO uses datasets based on climatological data from observing sites and ships and buoys in global marine networks, developed and maintained by the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (NASA GISS), the United Kingdom\u2019s Met Office Hadley Centre and the University of East Anglia\u2019s Climatic Research Unit (HadCRUT), and the Berkeley Earth group.\nWMO also uses reanalysis datasets from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and its Copernicus Climate Change Service, and the Japan Meteor\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Changes to Earth\u2019s climate driven by increased human emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases are already having widespread effects on the environment: glaciers and ice sheets are shrinking, river and lake ice is breaking up earlier, plant and animal geographic ranges are shifting, and plants and trees are blooming sooner.\nEffects that scientists had long predicted would result from global climate change are now occurring, such as sea ice loss, accelerated sea level rise, and longer, more intense heat waves.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nSome changes (such as droughts, wildfires, and extreme rainfall) are happening faster than scientists previously assessed. In fact, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) \u2014 the United Nations body established to assess the science related to climate change \u2014 modern humans have never before seen the observed changes in our global climate, and some of these changes are irreversible over the next hundreds to thousands of years.\nScientists have high confidence that global temperatures will continue to rise for many decades, mainly due to greenhouse gases produced by human activities.\nThe IPCC\u2019s Sixth Assessment report, published in 2021, found that human emissions of heat-trapping gases have already warmed the climate by nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius) since 1850-1900.1 The global average temperature is expected to reach or exceed 1.5 degrees C (about 3 degrees F) within the next few decades. These changes will affect all regions of Earth.\nThe severity of effects caused by climate change will depend on the path of future human activities. More greenhouse gas emissions will lead to more climate extremes and widespread damaging effects across our planet. However, those future effects depend on the total amount of carbon dioxide we emit. So, if we can reduce emissions, we may avoid some of the worst effects.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nHere are some of the expected effects of global climate change on the United States, according to the Third and Fourth National Climate Assessment Reports:\nGlobal sea level has risen about 8 inches (0.2 meters) since reliable record-keeping began in 1880. By 2100, scientists project that it will rise at least another foot (0.3 meters), but possibly as high as 6.6 feet (2 meters) in a high-emissions scenario. Sea level is rising because of added water from melting land ice and the expansion of seawater as it warms.

Image credit: Khagani Hasanov, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0\nScientists project that hurricane-associated storm intensity and rainfall rates will increase as the climate continues to warm. Image credit: NASA\nDroughts in the Southwest and heat waves (periods of abnormally hot weather lasting days to weeks) are projected to become more intense, and cold waves less intense and less frequent. Image credit: NOAA\nWarming temperatures have extended and intensified wildfire season in the West, where long-term drought in the region has heightened the risk of fires. Scientists estimate that human-caused climate change has already doubled the area of forest burned in recent decades. By around 2050, the amount of land consumed by wildfires in Western states is projected to further increase by two to six times. Even in traditionally rainy regions like the Southeast, wildfires are projected to increase by about 30%.\nClimate change is having an uneven effect on precipitation (rain and snow) in the United States, with some locations experiencing increased precipitation and flooding, while others suffer from drought. On average, more winter and spring precipitation is projected for the northern United States, and less for the Southwest, over this century. Image credit: Marvin Nauman/FEMA\nThe length of the frost-free season, and the corresponding growing season, has been increasing since the 1980s, with the largest increases occurring in the western United States. Across the United States, the growing season is projected to continue to lengthen, which will affect ecosystems and agriculture.\nSummer of 2023 was Earth's hottest summer on record, 0.41 degrees Fahrenheit (F) (0.23 degrees Celsius (C)) warmer than any other summer in NASA\u2019s record and 2.1 degrees F (1.2 C) warmer than the average summer between 1951 and 1980. Image credit: NASA\nSea ice cover in the Arctic Ocean is expected to continue decreasing, and the Arctic Ocean will very likely become essentially ice-free in late summer if current projections hold. This change is expected to occur before mid-century.\nClimate change is bringing different types of challenges to each region of the country. Some of the current and future impacts are summarized below.

The past ten years have all been in the Top Ten, in an extraordinary streak of record-breaking temperatures.\nThe global average surface temperature was 1.55 \u00b0C (with a margin of uncertainty of \u00b1 0.13 \u00b0C) above the 1850-1900 average, according to WMO\u2019s consolidated analysis of the six datasets. This means that we have likely just experienced the first calendar year with a global mean temperature of more than 1.5\u00b0C above the 1850-1900 average.\n\u201cToday\u2019s assessment from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) proves yet again \u2013 global heating is a cold, hard fact,\u201d said UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3no Guterres.\n\u201cIndividual years pushing past the 1.5 degree limit do not mean the long-term goal is shot. It means we need to fight even harder to get on track. Blazing temperatures in 2024 require trail-blazing climate action in 2025,\u201d he said. \u201cThere's still time to avoid the worst of climate catastrophe. But leaders must act \u2013 now,\u201d he said.\nThe WMO provides a temperature assessment based on multiple sources of data to support international climate monitoring and to provide authoritative information for the UN Climate Change negotiating process. The datasets are from the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), Japan Meteorological Agency, NASA, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the UK\u2019s Met Office in collaboration with the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia (HadCRUT), and Berkeley Earth.\n\u201cClimate history is playing out before our eyes. We\u2019ve had not just one or two record-breaking years, but a full ten-year series. This has been accompanied by devastating and extreme weather, rising sea levels and melting ice, all powered by record-breaking greenhouse gas levels due to human activities,\u201d said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo.\n\u201cIt is important to emphasize that a single year of more than 1.5\u00b0C for a year does NOT mean that we have failed to meet Paris Agreement long-term temperature goals, which are measured over decades rather than an individual year. However, it is essential to recognize that every fraction of a degree of warming matters. Whether it is at a level below or above 1.5\u00b0C of warming, every additional increment of global warming increases the impacts on our lives, economies and our planet,\u201d said Celeste Saulo.\nThere is a margin of uncertainty in all temperature assessments. All six datasets place 2024 as the warmest year on record and all highlight the recent rate of warming. But not all show the temperature anomaly above 1.5 \u00b0C due to differing methodologies.\nThe timing of the release of the six temperature datasets was coordinated across the institutions in order to underline the exceptional conditions experienced during 2024.\nA separate study published in Advances in Atmospheric Sciences found that ocean warming in 2024 played a key role in the record high temperatures. The ocean is the warmest it has ever been as recorded by humans, not only at the surface but also for the upper 2000 meters, according to the study led by Prof. Lijing Cheng with the Institute of Atmospheric Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It involved a team of 54 scientists from seven countries and 31 institutes.\nAbout 90% of the excess heat from global warming is stored in the ocean, making ocean heat content a critical indicator of climate change. From 2023 to 2024, the global upper 2000 m ocean heat content increase is 16 zettajoules (1021 Joules), about 140 times the world\u2019s total electricity generation in 2023, according to the study, which is based on the Insitute of Atmospheric Physics dataset.\nWMO will provide full details of key climate change indicators, including greenhouse gases, surface temperatures, ocean heat, sea level rise, glacier retreat and sea ice extent, in its State of the Global Climate 2024 report to be issued in March 2025. This will also give details of high-impact events.\nMr Guterres called on governments to deliver new national climate action plans this year to limit long-term global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C, and support the most vulnerable deal with devastating climate impacts.\nOne or more individual years exceeding 1.5\u00b0C does not mean that we have missed the goal of \u201cholding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change\u201d as stated in the Paris Agreement. This refers to an extended period, typically decades or longer, although the Agreement itself does not provide a specific definition.\nShort-term temperature spikes in long-term warming can be caused by naturally occurring phenomena like El Ni\u00f1o, which persisted from mid-2023 to May 2024.\nAs global warming continues, there is an urgent need for careful tracking, monitoring and communication with regard to where the warming is relative to the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement, to help policymakers in their deliberations.\nAn international team of experts established by WMO has given an initial indication that long-term global warming as assessed in 2024 is currently about 1.3\u00b0C compared to the 1850-1900 baseline.\nWMO uses datasets based on climatological data from observing sites and ships and buoys in global marine networks, developed and maintained by the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (NASA GISS), the United Kingdom\u2019s Met Office Hadley Centre and the University of East Anglia\u2019s Climatic Research Unit (HadCRUT), and the Berkeley Earth group.\nWMO also uses reanalysis datasets from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and its Copernicus Climate Change Service, and the Japan Meteor\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Changes to Earth\u2019s climate driven by increased human emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases are already having widespread effects on the environment: glaciers and ice sheets are shrinking, river and lake ice is breaking up earlier, plant and animal geographic ranges are shifting, and plants and trees are blooming sooner.\nEffects that scientists had long predicted would result from global climate change are now occurring, such as sea ice loss, accelerated sea level rise, and longer, more intense heat waves.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nSome changes (such as droughts, wildfires, and extreme rainfall) are happening faster than scientists previously assessed. In fact, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) \u2014 the United Nations body established to assess the science related to climate change \u2014 modern humans have never before seen the observed changes in our global climate, and some of these changes are irreversible over the next hundreds to thousands of years.\nScientists have high confidence that global temperatures will continue to rise for many decades, mainly due to greenhouse gases produced by human activities.\nThe IPCC\u2019s Sixth Assessment report, published in 2021, found that human emissions of heat-trapping gases have already warmed the climate by nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius) since 1850-1900.1 The global average temperature is expected to reach or exceed 1.5 degrees C (about 3 degrees F) within the next few decades. These changes will affect all regions of Earth.\nThe severity of effects caused by climate change will depend on the path of future human activities. More greenhouse gas emissions will lead to more climate extremes and widespread damaging effects across our planet. However, those future effects depend on the total amount of carbon dioxide we emit. So, if we can reduce emissions, we may avoid some of the worst effects.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nHere are some of the expected effects of global climate change on the United States, according to the Third and Fourth National Climate Assessment Reports:\nGlobal sea level has risen about 8 inches (0.2 meters) since reliable record-keeping began in 1880. By 2100, scientists project that it will rise at least another foot (0.3 meters), but possibly as high as 6.6 feet (2 meters) in a high-emissions scenario. Sea level is rising because of added water from melting land ice and the expansion of seawater as it warms.

Image credit: Khagani Hasanov, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0\nScientists project that hurricane-associated storm intensity and rainfall rates will increase as the climate continues to warm. Image credit: NASA\nDroughts in the Southwest and heat waves (periods of abnormally hot weather lasting days to weeks) are projected to become more intense, and cold waves less intense and less frequent. Image credit: NOAA\nWarming temperatures have extended and intensified wildfire season in the West, where long-term drought in the region has heightened the risk of fires. Scientists estimate that human-caused climate change has already doubled the area of forest burned in recent decades. By around 2050, the amount of land consumed by wildfires in Western states is projected to further increase by two to six times. Even in traditionally rainy regions like the Southeast, wildfires are projected to increase by about 30%.\nClimate change is having an uneven effect on precipitation (rain and snow) in the United States, with some locations experiencing increased precipitation and flooding, while others suffer from drought. On average, more winter and spring precipitation is projected for the northern United States, and less for the Southwest, over this century. Image credit: Marvin Nauman/FEMA\nThe length of the frost-free season, and the corresponding growing season, has been increasing since the 1980s, with the largest increases occurring in the western United States. Across the United States, the growing season is projected to continue to lengthen, which will affect ecosystems and agriculture.\nSummer of 2023 was Earth's hottest summer on record, 0.41 degrees Fahrenheit (F) (0.23 degrees Celsius (C)) warmer than any other summer in NASA\u2019s record and 2.1 degrees F (1.2 C) warmer than the average summer between 1951 and 1980. Image credit: NASA\nSea ice cover in the Arctic Ocean is expected to continue decreasing, and the Arctic Ocean will very likely become essentially ice-free in late summer if current projections hold. This change is expected to occur before mid-century.\nClimate change is bringing different types of challenges to each region of the country.

Virtually all climate scientists agree that this increase in heat-trapping gases is the main reason for the 1.8\u00b0F (1.0\u00b0C) rise in global average temperature since the late nineteenth century. Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, and various chlorofluorocarbons are all human-emitted heat-trapping gases. Among these, carbon dioxide is of greatest concern to scientists because it exerts a larger overall warming influence than the other gases combined.\nSteam billows from the Intermountain Power Plant in Delta, Utah.

Blue bars indicate cooler-than-average years; red bars show warmer-than-average years. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Information.\nAccording to the annual report from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, 2024 was the warmest year since global records began in 1850. The global average surface temperature was 2.32 Fahrenheit (1.29 degrees Celsius) above the 20th-century average (57.0 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.9 degrees Celsius) and 2.63 degrees Fahrenheit (1.46 degrees Celsius) above the pre-industrial average (56.7 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.7 degrees Celsius), which NOAA defines as the period from 1850-1900.\nGlobal temperatures in 2024 were above the 1991-2020 average (red) across most of the planet. Yearly temperatures compared to the 20th-century average (bar chart) show that it has been 48 years since Earth had a cooler-than-average year. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe 2024 global temperature anomaly (anomaly means \u201cdifference from average\u201d) is 0.18 degrees F (0.10 degrees C) warmer than the previous record, set the year before, in 2023. The ten warmest years in the 175-year record have all occurred during the last decade (2015\u20132024). When the new century started in 2000, the first year to set a new high-temperature record was 2005. Now, 2005 is just the 13th-warmest year on record.\nOther 2024 rankings included...\nFor more regional details and 2024 climate statistics, see the 2024 Global Climate Report from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe global average surface temperature is an indicator of the state of Earth\u2019s energy balance: how much sunlight it absorbs minus how much heat it radiates back to space. When these amounts are the same, Earth\u2019s average surface temperature remains steady. When they are out of balance, Earth cools or warms. Earth\u2019s average surface temperature has been rising because human-produced greenhouse gases are causing Earth to absorb more energy than it radiates back to space.\nGiven the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of added heat energy to raise Earth\u2019s average surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree-Fahrenheit (1-degree-Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1850-1900 in NOAA's record) might seem small, but it represents a significant increase in heat energy circulating through all parts of the Earth system, including the oceans, frozen landscapes, and the atmosphere.\nBeyond being an indicator of changes in Earth\u2019s energy balance, surface temperature matters because it controls many environmental and ecological processes that are important to humans and other life, including the water cycle (evaporation, clouds, surface water supplies, and precipitation), the carbon cycle, and the kinds of plants, animals, and other living things that can survive in different places on Earth.\nThe concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (55 degrees Celsius) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the \"average\" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget, which can only be directly measured from space.\nTo calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute temperature readings to temperature anomalies\u2014the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend.\nAcross inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and known physical relationships\u2014such as the way temperature decreases with altitude\u2014to estimate the missing values. Each value is then used to calculate a global-scale temperature anomaly. This process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in Earth's surface temperature over time.

And the rate of warming has accelerated in recent decades. According to NOAA's 2024 Annual Climate Report the combined land and ocean temperature has warmed at an average rate of 0.11 degrees Fahrenheit (0.06 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1850 and more than three times that rate (0.36 degrees Fahrenheit, or 0.20 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1975.\nRecent rates of global warming (1994-2024, bottom) are larger than the longer-term average rates (1901-2024, top).

Blue bars indicate cooler-than-average years; red bars show warmer-than-average years. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Information.\nAccording to the annual report from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, 2024 was the warmest year since global records began in 1850. The global average surface temperature was 2.32 Fahrenheit (1.29 degrees Celsius) above the 20th-century average (57.0 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.9 degrees Celsius) and 2.63 degrees Fahrenheit (1.46 degrees Celsius) above the pre-industrial average (56.7 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.7 degrees Celsius), which NOAA defines as the period from 1850-1900.\nGlobal temperatures in 2024 were above the 1991-2020 average (red) across most of the planet. Yearly temperatures compared to the 20th-century average (bar chart) show that it has been 48 years since Earth had a cooler-than-average year. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe 2024 global temperature anomaly (anomaly means \u201cdifference from average\u201d) is 0.18 degrees F (0.10 degrees C) warmer than the previous record, set the year before, in 2023. The ten warmest years in the 175-year record have all occurred during the last decade (2015\u20132024). When the new century started in 2000, the first year to set a new high-temperature record was 2005. Now, 2005 is just the 13th-warmest year on record.\nOther 2024 rankings included...\nFor more regional details and 2024 climate statistics, see the 2024 Global Climate Report from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe global average surface temperature is an indicator of the state of Earth\u2019s energy balance: how much sunlight it absorbs minus how much heat it radiates back to space. When these amounts are the same, Earth\u2019s average surface temperature remains steady. When they are out of balance, Earth cools or warms. Earth\u2019s average surface temperature has been rising because human-produced greenhouse gases are causing Earth to absorb more energy than it radiates back to space.\nGiven the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of added heat energy to raise Earth\u2019s average surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree-Fahrenheit (1-degree-Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1850-1900 in NOAA's record) might seem small, but it represents a significant increase in heat energy circulating through all parts of the Earth system, including the oceans, frozen landscapes, and the atmosphere.\nBeyond being an indicator of changes in Earth\u2019s energy balance, surface temperature matters because it controls many environmental and ecological processes that are important to humans and other life, including the water cycle (evaporation, clouds, surface water supplies, and precipitation), the carbon cycle, and the kinds of plants, animals, and other living things that can survive in different places on Earth.\nThe concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (55 degrees Celsius) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the \"average\" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget, which can only be directly measured from space.\nTo calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute temperature readings to temperature anomalies\u2014the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend.\nAcross inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and known physical relationships\u2014such as the way temperature decreases with altitude\u2014to estimate the missing values. Each value is then used to calculate a global-scale temperature anomaly. This process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in Earth's surface temperature over time.

And the rate of warming has accelerated in recent decades.

Data show 2023 was the warmest year since global records began ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments are the trusted source of scientific evidence for climate negotiations taking place under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Evidence-based decision-making needs to be informed by up-to-date and timely information on key indicators of the state of the climate system and of the human influence on the global climate system. However, successive IPCC reports are published at intervals of 5\u201310 years, creating potential for an information gap between report cycles.\nWe follow methods as close as possible to those used in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) Working Group One (WGI) report. We compile monitoring datasets to produce estimates for key climate indicators related to forcing of the climate system: emissions of greenhouse gases and short-lived climate forcers, greenhouse gas concentrations, radiative forcing, the Earth's energy imbalance, surface temperature changes, warming attributed to human activities, the remaining carbon budget, and estimates of global temperature extremes. The purpose of this effort, grounded in an open-data, open-science approach, is to make annually updated reliable global climate indicators available in the public domain (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11388387, Smith et al., 2024a). As they are traceable to IPCC report methods, they can be trusted by all parties involved in UNFCCC negotiations and help convey wider understanding of the latest knowledge of the climate system and its direction of travel.\nThe indicators show that, for the 2014\u20132023 decade average, observed warming was 1.19 [1.06 to 1.30] \u00b0C, of which 1.19 [1.0 to 1.4] \u00b0C was human-induced. For the single-year average, human-induced warming reached 1.31 [1.1 to 1.7] \u00b0C in 2023 relative to 1850\u20131900. The best estimate is below the 2023-observed warming record of 1.43 [1.32 to 1.53] \u00b0C, indicating a substantial contribution of internal variability in the 2023 record. Human-induced warming has been increasing at a rate that is unprecedented in the instrumental record, reaching 0.26 [0.2\u20130.4] \u00b0C per decade over 2014\u20132023. This high rate of warming is caused by a combination of net greenhouse gas emissions being at a persistent high of 53\u00b15.4 Gt CO2e yr\u22121 over the last decade, as well as reductions in the strength of aerosol cooling. Despite this, there is evidence that the rate of increase in CO2 emissions over the last decade has slowed compared to the 2000s, and depending on societal choices, a continued series of these annual updates over the critical 2020s decade could track a change of direction for some of the indicators presented here.\nThe IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) provided an assessment of human influence on key indicators of the state of climate grounded in data up to the year 2019 (IPCC, 2021a, Supplement Sect. S1). The next IPCC assessment report, AR7, is due towards the end of the decade. Given the speed of recent change, and the need for updated climate knowledge to inform evidence-based decision-making, the Indicators of Global Climate Change (IGCC) was initiated to provide policymakers with annual updates of the latest scientific understanding on the state of selected critical indicators of the climate system and of human influence.\nThis second annual update follows broadly the format of last year (Forster et al., 2023), focussing on indicators related to heating of the climate system, building from greenhouse gas emissions towards estimates of human-induced warming and the remaining carbon budget. Figure 1 presents an overview of the aspects assessed and their interlinkages from cause (emissions) through effect (changes in physical indicators) to climatic impact drivers. It also provides a visual roadmap as to the structure of remaining sections in this paper to guide the reader.\nFigure 1The flow chart of data production from emissions to human-induced warming and the remaining carbon budget, illustrating both the rationale and workflow within the paper production.\nDownload\nThe update is based on methodologies assessed by the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the physical science basis of climate change (Working Group One (WGI) report; IPCC, 2021a) as well as Chap. 2 of the WGIII report (Dhakal et al., 2022) and is aligned with the efforts initiated in AR6 to implement FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles for reproducibility and reusability (Pirani et al., 2022; Iturbide et al., 2022). IPCC reports make a much wider assessment of the science and methodologies \u2013 we do not attempt to reproduce the comprehensive nature of these IPCC assessments here. As such, we do not consider adopting fundamentally different approaches to AR6. Rather, our aim is to rigorously track both climate system change and evolving methodological improvements between IPCC report cycles, thereby achieving transparency and consistency in between successive reports.\nThe update is organised as follows: emissions (Sect. 2) and greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations (Sect. 3) are used to develop updated estimates of effective radiative forcing (Sect. 4). Earth's energy imbalance (Sect. 5) and observations of global surface temperature change (Sect. 6) are key global indicators of a warming world. The contributions to global surface temperature change from human and natural influences are formally attributed in Sect. 7, which tracks the level and rate of human-induced warming. Section 8 updates the remaining carbon budget to policy-relevant temperature thresholds. Section 9 gives an example of global-scale indicators associated with climate extremes of maximum land surface temperatures. An important purpose of the exercise is to make these indicators widely available and understood. Code and data availability is given in Sect. 10, and conclusions are presented in Sect. 11.

Virtually all climate scientists agree that this increase in heat-trapping gases is the main reason for the 1.8\u00b0F (1.0\u00b0C) rise in global average temperature since the late nineteenth century. Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, and various chlorofluorocarbons are all human-emitted heat-trapping gases. Among these, carbon dioxide is of greatest concern to scientists because it exerts a larger overall warming influence than the other gases combined.\nSteam billows from the Intermountain Power Plant in Delta, Utah.

Of this human-produced carbon, forests and other vegetation absorb around 3.2 billion metric tons per year, while the ocean absorbs about 2.5 billion metric tons per year. A net 5 billion metric tons of human-produced carbon remain in the atmosphere each year, raising the global average carbon dioxide concentrations by about 2.3 parts per million per year.

    "input_prompt": "Claim:\nThe planet's climate is changing.\n\nArticle Title:\nClimate change: global temperature\n\nGoogle Search Snippet:\nEarth's temperature has risen by an average of 0.11\u00b0 Fahrenheit (0.06\u00b0 Celsius) per decade since 1850, or about 2\u00b0 F in total.\n\nFull Page Content:\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments are the trusted source of scientific evidence for climate negotiations taking place under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Evidence-based decision-making needs to be informed by up-to-date and timely information on key indicators of the state of the climate system and of the human influence on the global climate system. However, successive IPCC reports are published at intervals of 5\u201310 years, creating potential for an information gap between report cycles.\nWe follow methods as close as possible to those used in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) Working Group One (WGI) report. We compile monitoring datasets to produce estimates for key climate indicators related to forcing of the climate system: emissions of greenhouse gases and short-lived climate forcers, greenhouse gas concentrations, radiative forcing, the Earth's energy imbalance, surface temperature changes, warming attributed to human activities, the remaining carbon budget, and estimates of global temperature extremes. The purpose of this effort, grounded in an open-data, open-science approach, is to make annually updated reliable global climate indicators available in the public domain (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11388387, Smith et al., 2024a). As they are traceable to IPCC report methods, they can be trusted by all parties involved in UNFCCC negotiations and help convey wider understanding of the latest knowledge of the climate system and its direction of travel.\nThe indicators show that, for the 2014\u20132023 decade average, observed warming was 1.19 [1.06 to 1.30] \u00b0C, of which 1.19 [1.0 to 1.4] \u00b0C was human-induced. For the single-year average, human-induced warming reached 1.31 [1.1 to 1.7] \u00b0C in 2023 relative to 1850\u20131900. The best estimate is below the 2023-observed warming record of 1.43 [1.32 to 1.53] \u00b0C, indicating a substantial contribution of internal variability in the 2023 record. Human-induced warming has been increasing at a rate that is unprecedented in the instrumental record, reaching 0.26 [0.2\u20130.4] \u00b0C per decade over 2014\u20132023. This high rate of warming is caused by a combination of net greenhouse gas emissions being at a persistent high of 53\u00b15.4 Gt CO2e yr\u22121 over the last decade, as well as reductions in the strength of aerosol cooling. Despite this, there is evidence that the rate of increase in CO2 emissions over the last decade has slowed compared to the 2000s, and depending on societal choices, a continued series of these annual updates over the critical 2020s decade could track a change of direction for some of the indicators presented here.\nThe IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) provided an assessment of human influence on key indicators of the state of climate grounded in data up to the year 2019 (IPCC, 2021a, Supplement Sect. S1). The next IPCC assessment report, AR7, is due towards the end of the decade. Given the speed of recent change, and the need for updated climate knowledge to inform evidence-based decision-making, the Indicators of Global Climate Change (IGCC) was initiated to provide policymakers with annual updates of the latest scientific understanding on the state of selected critical indicators of the climate system and of human influence.\nThis second annual update follows broadly the format of last year (Forster et al., 2023), focussing on indicators related to heating of the climate system, building from greenhouse gas emissions towards estimates of human-induced warming and the remaining carbon budget. Figure 1 presents an overview of the aspects assessed and their interlinkages from cause (emissions) through effect (changes in physical indicators) to climatic impact drivers. It also provides a visual roadmap as to the structure of remaining sections in this paper to guide the reader.\nFigure 1The flow chart of data production from emissions to human-induced warming and the remaining carbon budget, illustrating both the rationale and workflow within the paper production.\nDownload\nThe update is based on methodologies assessed by the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the physical science basis of climate change (Working Group One (WGI) report; IPCC, 2021a) as well as Chap. 2 of the WGIII report (Dhakal et al., 2022) and is aligned with the efforts initiated in AR6 to implement FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles for reproducibility and reusability (Pirani et al., 2022; Iturbide et al., 2022). IPCC reports make a much wider assessment of the science and methodologies \u2013 we do not attempt to reproduce the comprehensive nature of these IPCC assessments here. As such, we do not consider adopting fundamentally different approaches to AR6. Rather, our aim is to rigorously track both climate system change and evolving methodological improvements between IPCC report cycles, thereby achieving transparency and consistency in between successive reports.\nThe update is organised as follows: emissions (Sect. 2) and greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations (Sect. 3) are used to develop updated estimates of effective radiative forcing (Sect. 4). Earth's energy imbalance (Sect. 5) and observations of global surface temperature change (Sect. 6) are key global indicators of a warming world. The contributions to global surface temperature change from human and natural influences are formally attributed in Sect. 7, which tracks the level and rate of human-induced warming. Section 8 updates the remaining carbon budget to policy-relevant temperature thresholds. Section 9 gives an example of global-scale indicators associated with climate extremes of maximum land surface temperatures. An important purpose of the exercise is to make these indicators widely available and understood. Code and data availability is given in Sect. 10, and conclusions are presented in Sect. 11. Data are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11388387 (Smith et al., 2024a).\nHistoric emissions from human ac\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This total annual cost may rise by several billion as additional costs from identified events are reported. There were at least 492 fatalities associated with these events. The costliest events in 2023 were:\nOver the last seven years (2017\u20132023), 137 separate billion-dollar disasters have killed at least 5,500 people and cost greater than $1 trillion in damage.\nThis is also a record 13th consecutive year where the U.S. experienced 10 or more billion-dollar disasters and the fourth consecutive year (2020\u20132023) where 18 or more billion-dollar disasters impacted the U.S.\nSince records began in 1980, the U.S. has sustained 376 separate weather and climate disasters where overall damages/costs reached or exceeded $1 billion (based on the CPI adjustment to 2023) per event. The total cost of these 376 events exceeds $2.660 trillion.\nFor the year, temperatures were above average across most of the contiguous U.S., with near- to below-average temperatures from parts of the central Rockies to California. Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Hampshire and Massachusetts each ranked warmest while Maine, Vermont, Connecticut, Maryland, Virginia and Florida each ranked second warmest in the 129-year record. An additional 24 states experienced a top-10 warmest January\u2013December on record.\nThe Alaska January\u2013December temperature was 28.4\u00b0F, 2.4\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking 17th warmest in the 99-year record for the state. Much of the state was above normal for the 12-month period while temperatures were near average across parts of southern, western and interior parts of the state.\nPrecipitation was above average across much of the Northeast, from parts of the western Plains to California, as well as in parts of the Great Lakes, southern Plains, Mississippi Valley and Southeast. Precipitation was below average from parts of the Southwest to the Gulf of Mexico, parts of the Northwest, the Ohio Valley to Mid-Atlantic and much of the Mississippi Valley. Louisiana had the eighth-driest January\u2013December on record. Conversely, Maine ranked fifth wettest, while Vermont and Connecticut each ranked sixth wettest on record for this 12-month period. Three additional states ranked among their top-10 wettest for this year-to-date period.\nJanuary\u2013December 2023 ranked fifth wettest on record for Alaska, with above-average precipitation observed across most of the state. Near-normal precipitation was observed in parts of the Southwest, while parts of the Aleutians experienced below-average precipitation during this period.\nRecord-warm sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic basin brought 20 named tropical systems during 2023, ranking fourth for the most named storms in a year since 1950. Seven of these storms were hurricanes, including three that intensified to major hurricanes, while three of these storms made landfall in the U.S.\u2014Hurricane Idalia and tropical storms Harold and Ophelia.\nSeveral notable storms brought destruction and flooding to portions of the U.S. and its territories during the months of August and September:\nThe 2023 tornado count was above the annual 1991\u20132020 annual average across the contiguous U.S. with 1,197 confirmed tornadoes reported, with an additional 97 preliminary tornadoes still under verification during the October 1 to December 31 period.\nThe number of wildfires in 2023 was close to the 10-year average (2013\u20132022) with more than 55,500 wildfires reported over the year, while the total acres burned from these wildfires\u20142.6 million acres\u2014were well below this 10-year average of 7.1 million acres. In Alaska, nearly 300,000 acres burned during the 2023 fire season\u2014less than half of the state\u2019s seasonal average.\nSmoke from Canadian wildfires caused significant air quality issues for millions in portions of the Northeast and Great Lakes this year. On June 7, around 100 million people across 16 states were under air quality alerts while New York City reported the worst air quality of major cities worldwide. On June 27, Chicago reported the worst air quality of any major city in the world as wildfire smoke affected a large portion of the Midwest.\nThe year began with the peak coverage of 46.3 percent of the contiguous U.S in drought. Drought coverage shrank as late winter and spring atmospheric rivers and the summer monsoon brought above-normal precipitation to much of the western U.S, recharging some of the major reservoirs that dropped to their lowest levels in 2022. Drought reached a minimum extent of 19 percent on May 30\u2014the smallest contiguous U.S. drought footprint since mid-2020.\nExtreme short-term dryness across the Mississippi Valley, combined with persistent dryness across parts of the Plains, reduced streamflow in the Mississippi River to record low water levels for the second year in a row, closing off a vital channel to barge traffic at a crucial time of the year for the transport of crops from the nation\u2019s heartland.\nSeveral other notable heat events brought record-breaking warmth to portions of the U.S. this year:\nA series of nine atmospheric river events from late December 2022 into mid-January 2023 dumped a record amount of rain and mountain snow across parts of the western U.S, hitting California particularly hard causing more than 700 landslides, over 1,400 rescues plus loss of life.

Seven of these storms were hurricanes, including three that intensified to major hurricanes, while three of these storms made landfall in the U.S.\u2014Hurricane Idalia and tropical storms Harold and Ophelia.\nSeveral notable storms brought destruction and flooding to portions of the U.S. and its territories during the months of August and September:\nThe 2023 tornado count was above the annual 1991\u20132020 annual average across the contiguous U.S. with 1,197 confirmed tornadoes reported, with an additional 97 preliminary tornadoes still under verification during the October 1 to December 31 period.\nThe number of wildfires in 2023 was close to the 10-year average (2013\u20132022) with more than 55,500 wildfires reported over the year, while the total acres burned from these wildfires\u20142.6 million acres\u2014were well below this 10-year average of 7.1 million acres. In Alaska, nearly 300,000 acres burned during the 2023 fire season\u2014less than half of the state\u2019s seasonal average.\nSmoke from Canadian wildfires caused significant air quality issues for millions in portions of the Northeast and Great Lakes this year. On June 7, around 100 million people across 16 states were under air quality alerts while New York City reported the worst air quality of major cities worldwide. On June 27, Chicago reported the worst air quality of any major city in the world as wildfire smoke affected a large portion of the Midwest.\nThe year began with the peak coverage of 46.3 percent of the contiguous U.S in drought. Drought coverage shrank as late winter and spring atmospheric rivers and the summer monsoon brought above-normal precipitation to much of the western U.S, recharging some of the major reservoirs that dropped to their lowest levels in 2022. Drought reached a minimum extent of 19 percent on May 30\u2014the smallest contiguous U.S. drought footprint since mid-2020.\nExtreme short-term dryness across the Mississippi Valley, combined with persistent dryness across parts of the Plains, reduced streamflow in the Mississippi River to record low water levels for the second year in a row, closing off a vital channel to barge traffic at a crucial time of the year for the transport of crops from the nation\u2019s heartland.\nSeveral other notable heat events brought record-breaking warmth to portions of the U.S. this year:\nA series of nine atmospheric river events from late December 2022 into mid-January 2023 dumped a record amount of rain and mountain snow across parts of the western U.S, hitting California particularly hard causing more than 700 landslides, over 1,400 rescues plus loss of life. By January 26, snow covered nearly 60 percent of the contiguous U.S., while snow cover was below normal from the Plains to the Northeast during January. In February, a rare winter storm dumped he\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

If human activity has left us teetering on the edge of potentially irreversible climate tipping points, we\u2019re also responsible for fixing it.\nThe good news is that there\u2019s a reason for hope. Our capacity to innovate has ensured the survival of human civilisation through millennia. Innovation has helped us through healthcare, societal, and environmental emergencies. It\u2019s quite clear now that relentless and radical innovation is the only way to push ahead of a crisis as extensive as climate change. We\u2019ve made progress towards reducing our carbon footprint, yet the challenge ahead remains enormous. But, we can be optimistic that human ingenuity will help us turn the situation around.\nHere are four of the most exciting technologies that could shape the future of our response to climate change:\nAccording to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), it\u2019s going to take more than just reducing emissions to achieve the ambitions of the Paris Agreement and limit future temperature rises to 1.5\u00b0C. Because the warming effect of greenhouse gases can persist for thousands of years, we also need to actively remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to avert the worst effects of climate change and achieve net zero targets. Even with significant emissions reductions, the IPCC estimates that we will need to remove up to 1 trillion tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere over this century. This is urgent considering that atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are now over 50% higher than pre-industrial levels.\nLuckily, considerable progress has been made with Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) technologies, providing hope for their large-scale deployment. After decades of testing and being relegated to the niche corners of the global energy landscape, CCUS technologies could finally be sufficiently feasible to attract the financial backing necessary to be applied on a climate-relevant scale. With more financial and policy support, carbon capture technologies could help solve emissions challenges for the biggest polluters such as manufacturing, electricity generation and transportation, which are collectively responsible for over 73% of our emissions.\nThere\u2019s more. Rather than simply storing the captured carbon dioxide underground, innovation is making it possible to convert it into useful products like sustainable aviation fuel, which could help to decarbonise global aviation. Another exciting project hopes to use over 1 million tonnes of captured CO2 a year to develop a revolutionary single-cell protein for the animal feed industry.\nLivestock accounts for roughly 14.5% of total greenhouse gas emissions. This presents a huge challenge for the climate especially as the demand for meat continues to rise with economic and population growth worldwide. Lab-grown meat and plant-based alternative proteins could help meet this growing demand while getting rid of planet-heating emissions from livestock. However, conventional cultured meat production processes present both ethical and sustainability challenges. For instance, the media used to grow the meat (fetal bovine serum) is traditionally produced from blood drawn from foetuses in pregnant cows during slaughter.\nHowever, sustained innovation has enabled the development of a novel, economical and environmentally friendly medium for cultured meat using cells taken painlessly from living cows. This will provide a pathway to a truly viable and ethical alternative to traditional resource-intensive meat production. With increasing global demand for meat substitutes, this presents an exciting opportunity for substantial environmental benefits while reducing pressure on important resources like land and water.\nTransitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources will be key to tackling climate change. Often, visions of wind turbines, solar panels, and hydroelectric dams come to mind when confronted with the aforementioned. But, what about nuclear power plants?\nNuclear power holds great potential in a world confronting climate change as the only low-carbon generation technology that can provide a reliable, constant baseload of energy to balance the variability of other renewable energy sources. It\u2019s already been powering the UK for generations, currently provides one-third of our clean energy, and is the cheapest electricity going into the grid. Now, we need more nuclear power to reach net zero.\nIn 2009, the UK Government\u2019s Low Carbon Industrial Strategy announced a commitment to establishing \u201ca Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre that combines the knowledge, practices and expertise of manufacturing companies with the capability of universities.\u201d Officially launching in May 2012, the Nuclear AMRC \u2013 led by The University of Sheffield, The University of Manchester and Rolls-Royce \u2013 supports UK manufacturing companies upskill and get ready to bid for work in the nuclear supply chain.\nAs well as commissioning and building more nuclear power plants, advanced fusion and fission reactor designs promise to make nuclear a cheaper and safer option.

The following is our report on global mean temperature during 2023.\nWe conclude that 2023 was the warmest year on Earth since 1850, exceeding the previous record set in 2016 by a clear and definitive margin.\nThe global annual average for 2023 in our dataset was estimated as 1.54 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b0C (2.77 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b0F) above the average during the period 1850 to 1900, which is traditionally used a reference for the preindustrial period. This is the first time that any year has exceeded the key 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) threshold. The significance of this is discussed below. Also, please note that given the uncertainties and differences in methodologies, other groups are expected to report 2023 as slightly less than 1.5 \u00b0C above preindustrial. The differences between Berkeley Earth\u2019s analysis and that of other groups is discussed at the end of this report.\nThe last nine years have included all nine of the warmest years observed in the instrumental record.\nThe long-term trend towards higher temperatures is being driven by man-made global warming. However, year-to-year rankings are likely to reflect short-term natural variability. In 2023, an emerging El Ni\u00f1o event combined with other natural and man-made factors discussed below to create a record-breaking warm year. By contrast, 2021 and 2022 had somewhat lower temperatures due to a persistent a La Ni\u00f1a event. The cyclic warming and cooling due to El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a is one of the largest sources of year-to-year internal variability in the global average temperature, often adding or subtracting 0.1 \u00b0C from the global average.\n2023 was a highly unusual year in several respects, including record warmth in most ocean basins and a large deviation from the historical trend. Warmth in 2023 greatly exceeded expectations, and was much stronger than normal this early in an El Ni\u00f1o. Some studies have recently argued that the pace of global warming may be accelerating, and some of the evidence for this is discussed below. However, given historical variability in surface temperatures, it still remains too early to conclude whether or not the pace of surface warming has increased.\nDuring 2023, 17% of the Earth\u2019s surface had a locally record warm annual average. By chance, these areas coincided with a number of major population centers. We estimate that 2.3 billion people \u2014 29% of Earth\u2019s population \u2014 experienced a locally record warm annual average in 2023. This includes half the population of China, and a majority of the populations of Bangladesh, Japan, Mexico, as well as much of South and Central America.\nNone of the Earth\u2019s surface had a record cold annual average in 2023.\nAs discussed below, we believe there are slightly better than even odds that 2024 will be warmer than 2023.\nIn addition, 2023 was notable for:\nIn Berkeley Earth\u2019s analysis the global mean temperature in 2023 is estimated to have been 1.54 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b0C (2.77 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b0F) above the average temperature from 1850-1900, a period often used as a pre-industrial baseline for global temperature targets. This is ~0.17 \u00b0C (~0.30 \u00b0F) warmer than the previous record high observed in 2016. As a result, 2023 is the warmest year to have been directly observed using thermometer measurements, and stands out well-above all previous years.\nThis is the first time that an annual average temperature has exceeded the pre-industrial baseline period by more than 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F).\nUnder the Paris Agreement, many countries have set an aspirational goal of limiting long-term global warming to no more than 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F). That target is based on the state of the climate averaged over many years, so it is not automatically considered to have been breached by a single year exceeding 1.5 \u00b0C of warming. However, a single year exceeding 1.5 \u00b0C is a stark warning sign of how close the overall climate system has come to exceeding this Paris Agreement goal. With greenhouse gas emissions continuing to set record highs, it is likely that climate will regularly exceed 1.5 \u00b0C in the next decade.\nThe last nine years stand out as the nine warmest years to have been directly observed.\nThe temperature uncertainties can be visualized using the schematic below where each year\u2019s temperature estimate is represented by a distribution reflecting its uncertainty. In the analysis that Berkeley Earth conducts, the uncertainty on the mean temperature of a single year is approximately 0.03 \u00b0C (0.05 \u00b0F) for recent years. The global mean temperature in 2023 lies far above the previous record high set in 2016 and all other years.\nThe last nine years have been part of a period of significant warmth well above all previous years since 1850. This reflects the long-term trend towards man-made global warming.\nIn 2023, the monthly-average temperature in January was similar to that in 2021 or 2022, but well below the previous record level. However, following the end of La Ni\u00f1a in the Pacific, record-breaking monthly-average warmth began in June and continued in every month through the rest of the year, often beating the previous monthly record by a large margin. September had the largest monthly anomaly ever observed, with December coming in as the second largest. Seven months in 2023 were at least 1.5 \u00b0C / 2.7 \u00b0F above their corresponding 1850-1900 average.\nOn land, 2023 was also the warmest year directly observed, reaching 2.10 \u00b0C / 3.78 \u00b0F above the 1850 to 1900 average. This is the first year with a land-average of more than 2.0 \u00b0C, and beats the previous record set in 2020 by 0.13 \u00b0C / 0.23 \u00b0F.\nAs discussed below, many territories saw local record warm annual averages in 2023.\nOn the ocean\u2019s surface, 2023 was also the warmest year directly observed, reaching 1.10 \u00b0C / 1.98 \u00b0F. This is the first year with a ocean-average above 1.0 \u00b0C, and beats the previous record set in 2020 by a very large maring, 0.16 \u00b0C / 0.29 \u00b0F\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

We\u2019ve made progress towards reducing our carbon footprint, yet the challenge ahead remains enormous. But, we can be optimistic that human ingenuity will help us turn the situation around.\nHere are four of the most exciting technologies that could shape the future of our response to climate change:\nAccording to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), it\u2019s going to take more than just reducing emissions to achieve the ambitions of the Paris Agreement and limit future temperature rises to 1.5\u00b0C. Because the warming effect of greenhouse gases can persist for thousands of years, we also need to actively remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to avert the worst effects of climate change and achieve net zero targets. Even with significant emissions reductions, the IPCC estimates that we will need to remove up to 1 trillion tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere over this century. This is urgent considering that atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are now over 50% higher than pre-industrial levels.\nLuckily, considerable progress has been made with Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) technologies, providing hope for their large-scale deployment. After decades of testing and being relegated to the niche corners of the global energy landscape, CCUS technologies could finally be sufficiently feasible to attract the financial backing necessary to be applied on a climate-relevant scale. With more financial and policy support, carbon capture technologies could help solve emissions challenges for the biggest polluters such as manufacturing, electricity generation and transportation, which are collectively responsible for over 73% of our emissions.\nThere\u2019s more. Rather than simply storing the captured carbon dioxide underground, innovation is making it possible to convert it into useful products like sustainable aviation fuel, which could help to decarbonise global aviation. Another exciting project hopes to use over 1 million tonnes of captured CO2 a year to develop a revolutionary single-cell protein for the animal feed industry.\nLivestock accounts for roughly 14.5% of total greenhouse gas emissions. This presents a huge challenge for the climate especially as the demand for meat continues to rise with economic and population growth worldwide. Lab-grown meat and plant-based alternative proteins could help meet this growing demand while getting rid of planet-heating emissions from livestock. However, conventional cultured meat production processes present both ethical and sustainability challenges. For instance, the media used to grow the meat (fetal bovine serum) is traditionally produced from blood drawn from foetuses in pregnant cows during slaughter.\nHowever, sustained innovation has enabled the development of a novel, economical and environmentally friendly medium for cultured meat using cells taken painlessly from living cows. This will provide a pathway to a truly viable and ethical alternative to traditional resource-intensive meat production. With increasing global demand for meat substitutes, this presents an exciting opportunity for substantial environmental benefits while reducing pressure on important resources like land and water.\nTransitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources will be key to tackling climate change.

With the right incentives and support, these innovations offer solid options to address climate change through a safe, sustainable, efficient, and low-carbon energy supply.\nEmissions related to energy use for the manufacturing of metals sits at about 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions, making this industry the bigge\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The following is our report on global mean temperature during 2023.\nWe conclude that 2023 was the warmest year on Earth since 1850, exceeding the previous record set in 2016 by a clear and definitive margin.\nThe global annual average for 2023 in our dataset was estimated as 1.54 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b0C (2.77 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b0F) above the average during the period 1850 to 1900, which is traditionally used a reference for the preindustrial period. This is the first time that any year has exceeded the key 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) threshold. The significance of this is discussed below. Also, please note that given the uncertainties and differences in methodologies, other groups are expected to report 2023 as slightly less than 1.5 \u00b0C above preindustrial. The differences between Berkeley Earth\u2019s analysis and that of other groups is discussed at the end of this report.\nThe last nine years have included all nine of the warmest years observed in the instrumental record.\nThe long-term trend towards higher temperatures is being driven by man-made global warming. However, year-to-year rankings are likely to reflect short-term natural variability. In 2023, an emerging El Ni\u00f1o event combined with other natural and man-made factors discussed below to create a record-breaking warm year. By contrast, 2021 and 2022 had somewhat lower temperatures due to a persistent a La Ni\u00f1a event. The cyclic warming and cooling due to El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a is one of the largest sources of year-to-year internal variability in the global average temperature, often adding or subtracting 0.1 \u00b0C from the global average.\n2023 was a highly unusual year in several respects, including record warmth in most ocean basins and a large deviation from the historical trend. Warmth in 2023 greatly exceeded expectations, and was much stronger than normal this early in an El Ni\u00f1o. Some studies have recently argued that the pace of global warming may be accelerating, and some of the evidence for this is discussed below. However, given historical variability in surface temperatures, it still remains too early to conclude whether or not the pace of surface warming has increased.\nDuring 2023, 17% of the Earth\u2019s surface had a locally record warm annual average. By chance, these areas coincided with a number of major population centers. We estimate that 2.3 billion people \u2014 29% of Earth\u2019s population \u2014 experienced a locally record warm annual average in 2023. This includes half the population of China, and a majority of the populations of Bangladesh, Japan, Mexico, as well as much of South and Central America.\nNone of the Earth\u2019s surface had a record cold annual average in 2023.\nAs discussed below, we believe there are slightly better than even odds that 2024 will be warmer than 2023.\nIn addition, 2023 was notable for:\nIn Berkeley Earth\u2019s analysis the global mean temperature in 2023 is estimated to have been 1.54 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b0C (2.77 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b0F) above the average temperature from 1850-1900, a period often used as a pre-industrial baseline for global temperature targets. This is ~0.17 \u00b0C (~0.30 \u00b0F) warmer than the previous record high observed in 2016. As a result, 2023 is the warmest year to have been directly observed using thermometer measurements, and stands out well-above all previous years.\nThis is the first time that an annual average temperature has exceeded the pre-industrial baseline period by more than 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F).\nUnder the Paris Agreement, many countries have set an aspirational goal of limiting long-term global warming to no more than 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F). That target is based on the state of the climate averaged over many years, so it is not automatically considered to have been breached by a single year exceeding 1.5 \u00b0C of warming. However, a single year exceeding 1.5 \u00b0C is a stark warning sign of how close the overall climate system has come to exceeding this Paris Agreement goal. With greenhouse gas emissions continuing to set record highs, it is likely that climate will regularly exceed 1.5 \u00b0C in the next decade.\nThe last nine years stand out as the nine warmest years to have been directly observed.\nThe temperature uncertainties can be visualized using the schematic below where each year\u2019s temperature estimate is represented by a distribution reflecting its uncertainty. In the analysis that Berkeley Earth conducts, the uncertainty on the mean temperature of a single year is approximately 0.03 \u00b0C (0.05 \u00b0F) for recent years. The global mean temperature in 2023 lies far above the previous record high set in 2016 and all other years.\nThe last nine years have been part of a period of significant warmth well above all previous years since 1850. This reflects the long-term trend towards man-made global warming.\nIn 2023, the monthly-average temperature in January was similar to that in 2021 or 2022, but well below the previous record level. However, following the end of La Ni\u00f1a in the Pacific, record-breaking monthly-average warmth began in June and continued in every month through the rest of the year, often beating the previous monthly record by a large margin. September had the largest monthly anomaly ever observed, with December coming in as the second largest. Seven months in 2023 were at least 1.5 \u00b0C / 2.7 \u00b0F above their corresponding 1850-1900 average.\nOn land, 2023 was also the warmest year directly observed, reaching 2.10 \u00b0C / 3.78 \u00b0F above the 1850 to 1900 average. This is the first year with a land-average of more than 2.0 \u00b0C, and beats the previous record set in 2020 by 0.13 \u00b0C / 0.23 \u00b0F.\nAs discussed below, many territories saw local record warm annual averages in 2023.\nOn the ocean\u2019s surface, 2023 was also the warmest year directly observed, reaching 1.10 \u00b0C / 1.98 \u00b0F. This is the first year with a ocean-average above 1.0 \u00b0C, and beats the previous record set in 2020 by a very large maring, 0.16 \u00b0C / 0.29 \u00b0F\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Some of the incoming sunlight is reflected directly back into space, especially by bright surfaces such as ice and clouds, and the rest is absorbed by the surface and the atmosphere. Much of this absorbed solar energy is re-emitted as heat (longwave or infrared radiation). The atmosphere in turn absorbs and re-radiates heat, some of which escapes to space. Any disturbance to this balance of incoming and outgoing energy will affect the climate. For example, small changes in the output of energy from the Sun will affect this balance directly.\nIf all heat energy emitted from the surface passed through the atmosphere directly into space, Earth\u2019s average surface temperature would be tens of degrees colder than today. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, including water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, act to make the surface much warmer than this because they absorb and emit heat energy in all directions (including downwards), keeping Earth\u2019s surface and lower atmosphere warm [Figure B1]. Without this greenhouse effect, life as we know it could not have evolved on our planet. Adding more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere makes it even more effective at preventing heat from escaping into space. When the energy leaving is less than the energy entering, Earth warms until a new balance is established.\nGreenhouse gases emitted by human activities alter Earth\u2019s energy balance and thus its climate. Humans also affect climate by changing the nature of the land surfaces (for example by clearing forests for farming) and through the emission of pollutants that affect the amount and type of particles in the atmosphere.\nScientists have determined that, when all human and natural factors are considered, Earth\u2019s climate balance has been altered towards warming, with the biggest contributor being increases in CO2.\nFigure b1. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, including water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, absorb heat energy and emit it in all directions (including downwards), keeping Earth\u2019s surface and lower atmosphere warm.

Image based on a figure from US EPA.\nThe atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide have increased significantly since the Industrial Revolution began. In the case of carbon dioxide, the average concentration measured at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii has risen from 316 parts per million (ppm) in 1959 (the first full year of data available) to more than 411 ppm in 2019 [Figure B2]. The same rates of increase have since been recorded at numerous other stations worldwide. Since preindustrial times, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 has increased by over 40%, methane has increased by more than 150%, and nitrous oxide has increased by roughly 20%. More than half of the increase in CO2 has occurred since 1970. Increases in all three gases contribute to warming of Earth, with the increase in CO2 playing the largest role.

Learn about the sources of human emitted greenhouse gases.\nScientists have examined greenhouse gases in the context of the past. Analysis of air trapped inside ice that has been accumulating over time in Antarctica shows that the CO2 concentration began to increase significantly in the 19th century [Figure B3], after staying in the range of 260 to 280 ppm for the previous 10,000 years. Ice core records extending back 800,000 years show that during that time, CO2 concentrations remained within the range of 170 to 300 ppm throughout many \u201cice age\u201d cycles - learn about the ice ages - and no concentration above 300 ppm is seen in ice core records until the past 200 years.\nMeasurements of the forms (isotopes) of carbon in the modern atmosphere show a clear fingerprint of the addition of \u201cold\u201d carbon (depleted in natural radioactive 14C) coming from the combustion of fossil fuels (as opposed to \u201cnewer\u201d carbon coming from living systems). In addition, it is known that human activities (excluding land use changes) currently emit an estimated 10 billion tonnes of carbon each year, mostly by burning fossil fuels, which is more than enough to explain the observed increase in concentration. These and other lines of evidence point conclusively to the fact that the elevated CO2 concentration in our atmosphere is the result of human activities.\nFig b2.

Some of the incoming sunlight is reflected directly back into space, especially by bright surfaces such as ice and clouds, and the rest is absorbed by the surface and the atmosphere. Much of this absorbed solar energy is re-emitted as heat (longwave or infrared radiation). The atmosphere in turn absorbs and re-radiates heat, some of which escapes to space. Any disturbance to this balance of incoming and outgoing energy will affect the climate. For example, small changes in the output of energy from the Sun will affect this balance directly.\nIf all heat energy emitted from the surface passed through the atmosphere directly into space, Earth\u2019s average surface temperature would be tens of degrees colder than today. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, including water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, act to make the surface much warmer than this because they absorb and emit heat energy in all directions (including downwards), keeping Earth\u2019s surface and lower atmosphere warm [Figure B1]. Without this greenhouse effect, life as we know it could not have evolved on our planet. Adding more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere makes it even more effective at preventing heat from escaping into space. When the energy leaving is less than the energy entering, Earth warms until a new balance is established.\nGreenhouse gases emitted by human activities alter Earth\u2019s energy balance and thus its climate. Humans also affect climate by changing the nature of the land surfaces (for example by clearing forests for farming) and through the emission of pollutants that affect the amount and type of particles in the atmosphere.\nScientists have determined that, when all human and natural factors are considered, Earth\u2019s climate balance has been altered towards warming, with the biggest contributor being increases in CO2.\nFigure b1. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, including water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, absorb heat energy and emit it in all directions (including downwards), keeping Earth\u2019s surface and lower atmosphere warm. Adding more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere enhances the effect, making Earth\u2019s surface and lower atmosphere even warmer. Image based on a figure from US EPA.\nThe atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide have increased significantly since the Industrial Revolution began. In the case of carbon dioxide, the average concentration measured at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii has risen from 316 parts per million (ppm) in 1959 (the first full year of data available) to more than 411 ppm in 2019 [Figure B2]. The same rates of increase have since been recorded at numerous other stations worldwide. Since preindustrial times, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 has increased by over 40%, methane has increased by more than 150%, and nitrous oxide has increased by roughly 20%. More than half of the increase in CO2 has occurred since 1970. Increases in all three gases contribute to warming of Earth, with the increase in CO2 playing the largest role. See page B3 to learn about the sources of human emitted greenhouse gases. Learn about the sources of human emitted greenhouse gases.\nScientists have examined greenhouse gases in the context of the past. Analysis of air trapped inside ice that has been accumulating over time in Antarctica shows that the CO2 concentration began to increase significantly in the 19th century [Figure B3], after staying in the range of 260 to 280 ppm for the previous 10,000 years. Ice core records extending back 800,000 years show that during that time, CO2 concentrations remained within the range of 170 to 300 ppm throughout many \u201cice age\u201d cycles - learn about the ice ages - and no concentration above 300 ppm is seen in ice core records until the past 200 years.\nMeasurements of the forms (isotopes) of carbon in the modern atmosphere show a clear fingerprint of the addition of \u201cold\u201d carbon (depleted in natural radioactive 14C) coming from the combustion of fossil fuels (as opposed to \u201cnewer\u201d carbon coming from living systems). In addition, it is known that human activities (excluding land use changes) currently emit an estimated 10 billion tonnes of carbon each year, mostly by burning fossil fuels, which is more than enough to explain the observed increase in concentration. These and other lines of evidence point conclusively to the fact that the elevated CO2 concentration in our atmosphere is the result of human activities.\nFig b2. Measurements of atmospheric CO2 since 1958 from the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii (black) and from the South Pole (red) show a steady annual increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration. The measurements are made at remote places like these because they are not greatly influenced by local processes, so therefore they are representative of the background atmosphere. The small up-and-down saw-tooth pattern reflects seasonal changes in the release and uptake of CO2 by plants. Source: Scripps CO2 Program\nFigure b3. CO2 variations during the past 1,000 years, obtained from analysis of air trapped in an ice core extracted from Antarctica (red squares), show a sharp rise in atmospheric CO2 starting in the late 19th century. Modern atmospheric measurements from Mauna Loa are superimposed in gray. Source: figure by Eric Wolff, data from Etheridge et al., 1996; MacFarling Meure et al., 2006; Scripps CO2 Program.\nEstimating global average surface air temperature increase requires careful analysis of millions of measurements from around the world, including from land stations, ships, and satellites. Despite the many complications of synthesising such data, multiple independent teams have concluded separately and unanimously that global average surface air temperature has risen by about 1 \u00b0C (1.8 \u00b0F) since 1900 [Figure B4]. Although the record shows several pauses and accelerations in the increasing trend, each of the l\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",
