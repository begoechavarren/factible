    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nWhat if I told you that someone had developed an energy source that could help us solve our biggest environmental challenges, purify our water and air, make our cities and homes more sanitary, and keep us safe from potential catastrophic climate change? What if I also told you that this energy source was cheap, plentiful, and reliable? Well, there is such a source. You probably know it as fossil fuel. Oil. Natural gas. Coal. But wait? Don\u2019t fossil fuels pollute our environment and make our climate unlivable? That, of course, is what we\u2019re told\u2026and what our children are taught. But let\u2019s look at the data. Here\u2019s a graph you\u2019ve probably never seen: the correlation between use of fossil fuels and access to clean water. More fossil fuel. More clean water. Am I saying the more we that we have used fossil fuel, the cleaner our water has become? Yes, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying. In the developed world, we take clean water for granted. We turn on a tap and it\u2019s there. But getting it there takes a massive amount of energy. Think of the man-made reservoirs, the purification plants, the network of pipes. In the undeveloped world, it\u2019s a much different story. They lack the energy, so they lack clean water. More fossil fuel. More clean water. The same is true of sanitation. By the use of cheap, plentiful, and reliable energy from fossil fuels, we have made our environment cleaner. Take a look at this graph. More fossil fuel. Better sanitation. Okay, what about air quality? Here\u2019s a graph of the air pollution trends in the United States over the last half century based on data from the Environmental Protection Agency. Note the dramatic downward trend in emissions, even though we use more fossil fuel than ever. How was this achieved? Above all, by using anti-pollution technology powered by\u2026 fossil fuel: oil, natural gas and coal. But even without modern pollution control technology, fossil fuel makes our air cleaner. Indoor pollution\u2014caused by burning a fire inside your house, cabin, hut or tent to cook and keep warm\u2014was a deadly global problem until the late 19th century when cheap kerosene, a fossil fuel byproduct, became available in America and Europe. Indoor pollution is still a major issue in the developing world today. The best solution? Fossil fuel. And now we come to the biggest fossil fuel concern of all\u2014global warming. On this very sensitive topic we need to get our terms straight: There is a big difference between mild global warming and catastrophic global warming. We can all agree on that, right? The issue isn\u2019t: does burning fossil fuel have some warming impact? It does. The issue is: is the climate warming dangerously fast? In 1986 NASA climate scientist James Hansen\u2014one of the world\u2019s most prominent critics of the use of fossil fuels\u2014predicted that \u201cif current trends are unchanged,\u201d temperatures would rise 2 to 4 degrees in the first decade of the 2000s. But as you can see from this graph, since 2000 the trend line is essentially flat\u2014little or no warming in the last 15 years. That\u2019s probably why we hear much less talk about \u201cglobal warming\u201d and much more talk about \u201cclimate change.\u201d Has this \u201cclimate change\u201d made our world more dangerous? The key statistic here, one that is, unfortunately, almost never mentioned, is \u201cclimate-related deaths,\u201d that is, how many people die each year from a climate-related cause, including droughts, floods, storms, and extreme temperatures. In the last eighty years, as CO2 emissions have rapidly escalated, the annual rate of climate-related deaths worldwide has rapidly declined -- by 98%. The reason is that the energy from fossil fuel has allowed the developed world to build a durable civilization, one highly resilient to extreme heat, extreme cold, floods, storms, and so on. The developing world\u2014where natural disasters can still wreak terrible havoc\u2014 would like the chance to do the same. But to do that they will need a lot more energy. The cheapest, fastest and easiest way to get that energy is from fossil fuels. In sum, fossil fuels don\u2019t take a naturally safe environment and make it dangerous; they empower us to take a naturally dangerous environment and make it cleaner and safer.

This progress occurred while U.S. economic indicators remain strong.\nThe emissions reductions have led to dramatic improvements in the quality of the air that we breathe. Between 1990 and 2020, national concentrations of air pollutants improved 73 percent for carbon monoxide, 86 percent for lead (from 2010), 61 percent for annual nitrogen dioxide, 25 percent for ozone, 26 percent for 24-hour coarse particle concentrations, 41 percent for annual fine particles (from 2000), and 91 percent for sulfur dioxide. (For more trends information, see EPA's Air Trends site.)\nA peer-reviewed EPA study issued in March 2011 found that the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 are achieving large health benefits that will grow further over time as programs take full effect.\nThis chart shows the health benefits of Clean Air Act programs that reduce levels of fine particles and ozone.\nEPA has required dramatic reductions in emissions from new motor vehicles and non-road engines - such as those used in construction, agriculture, industry, trains and marine vessels -- through standards that require a combination of cleaner engine technologies and cleaner fuels. In 2013, EPA estimated the benefits of five key standards to cut emissions from vehicles, engines and fuel to 2030.\nFurther reductions in power plant pollution have been achieved by state and EPA efforts to cut interstate air pollution, achieving additional public health benefits and helping downwind states meet health-based air quality standards for fine particles and ozone.\nOn October 15, 2016, with the United States\u2019 leadership, 197 countries adopted an amendment to phase down HFCs under the Montreal Protocol in Kigali, Rwanda. HFCs are greenhouse gases which can have warming impacts hundreds to thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide. Under the amendment, countries committed to cut the production and consumption of HFCs by more than 80 percent over the next 30 years.\nLearn more about the CAA and the economy.\n1 Pope, C.A. III, E.

On average, a human being can live without water for only three days. Increasing drought and water shortages are reducing water availability. Meanwhile, data center developers are increasingly tapping into surface and underground aquifers to cool their facilities.\nData center water usage closely parallels energy usage and carbon emissions. As data centers use more energy for their typical data center operations and to meet AI requests, they consume larger amounts of water to cool their processor chips, so as to avoid overheating and potential damage. Similarly, as energy use increases in data centers, so do carbon emissions.\nA medium-sized data center can consume up to roughly 110 million gallons of water per year for cooling purposes, equivalent to the annual water usage of approximately 1,000 households. Larger data centers can each \u201cdrink\u201d up to 5 million gallons per day, or about 1.8 billion annually, usage equivalent to a town of 10,000 to 50,000 people. Together, the nation\u2019s 5,426 data centers consume billions of gallons of water annually. One report estimated that U.S. data centers consume 449 million gallons of water per day and 163.7 billion gallons annually (as of 2021). A 2016 report found that fewer than one-third of data center operators track water consumption. Water consumption is expected to continue increasing as data centers grow in number, size, and complexity.\nAccording to scientists at the University of California, Riverside, each 100-word AI prompt is estimated to use roughly one bottle of water (or 519 milliliters). This may not sound like much, but billions of AI users worldwide enter prompts into systems like ChatGPT every minute. Large language models require many energy-intensive calculations, necessitating liquid cooling systems.\nThe Water Cycle of Data Centers\nA data center\u2019s water footprint is calculated as the sum of three categories: on-site water usage, water use by power plant facilities that supply power to data centers, and water consumption during the manufacturing process of processor chips. Water can come from various sources, including blue sources (e.g., surface water and groundwater), piped sources such as municipal water, and gray sources (e.g., purified reclaimed water). Using recycled or non-potable water to meet a data center\u2019s cooling needs is a well-established practice to conserve limited potable water resources, particularly in dry or drought-prone areas.\nIn the context of data centers, \u201cwater consumption\u201d refers to the amount of water withdrawn from blue or gray sources minus the water discharged by the centers (primarily warm water left over from cooling the IT racks). The consumed water is generally the water that evaporates or is otherwise taken out of immediate human usage. Withdrawal of fresh water from local streams or underground aquifers may lead to aquifer exhaustion, particularly in water-stressed areas.\nResearchers at The Green Grid, a nonprofit industry consortium, developed a metric called Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE) to measure water usage by data centers. Similar to the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) metric, which measures the energy efficiency of a data center, the WUE metric assesses the efficiency of a data center\u2019s water use. WUE is reported in liters per kilowatt-hour (kWh): a data center\u2019s total water consumption, measured in liters, is divided by the total energy consumed by that data center in kilowatt-hours in the same time period. While \u201c0\u201d is the ideal WUE score, this can only be achieved in air-cooled data centers, and most data centers cannot meet this target due to their location\u2019s climate conditions. The average WUE across data centers is 1.9 liters per kWh, which is a great goal to beat.\nData centers' water usage depends on various factors, including location, climate, water availability, size, and IT rack chip densities. In hotter climates, like in the southwest United States, data centers need to use more water to cool the building and equipment. With the increasing number of centers supporting AI requests, chip density is also growing, which leads to higher room temperatures, necessitating the use of more water chillers at the server level to maintain cool temperatures. Most data centers use a combination of chillers and on-site cooling towers to avoid chip overheating.\nCooling data centers is a complex operation. At the server level, water chillers cool IT rooms to maintain optimal temperatures and prevent damage to chips. This can be achieved through air cooling using water evaporation, which is an open-loop and more water-intensive method, or through server liquid cooling. Server cooling is a more expensive approach that delivers the liquid coolant directly to the graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs). Direct-to-chip liquid cooling and immersive liquid cooling are two standard server liquid cooling technologies that dissipate heat while significantly reducing water consumption. During immersive cooling, water or specialized synthetic liquids flood the chips, absorbing the heat. The difference between direct server liquid cooling and air cooling through evaporation can be compared to the difference between drip irrigation and flooding in agriculture.\nIn areas with limited water availability, server liquid cooling is the best choice, as it requires minimal water consumption. Conversely, in areas with a strained power grid, an evaporative air cooling tower is a suitable building design, as it requires minimal power usage.\nRegardless of the approach chosen, a heat exchanger is necessary to capture the hot air or hot water produced as a byproduct of the cooling process.

The negative impacts that non-renewable energy sources like fossil fuels have on air quality, climate change, and environmental health have become increasingly clear. By increasingly relying on renewable energy sources like wind and solar power, we can reap a wide variety of benefits including reduced air pollution, lower greenhouse gas emission levels, decreased healthcare costs, a more resilient electrical grid, and job generation.\nThe UN says that with technology available today, cheap electricity from renewable sources could provide 65 percent of the world\u2019s total electricity supply by 2030 and decarbonize 90 percent of the power sector by 2050, massively cutting carbon emissions and improving air quality. But what exactly is the relationship between energy production and air pollution? We\u2019ll take a deep dive into this topic and see that the benefits of investing in clean energy sources become even more compelling when both air quality and climate benefits are considered.\nNon-renewable energy comes from sources that cannot be replenished in our lifetime. The most common sources of non-renewable energy are carbon-containing fossil fuels, including coal, petroleum, and natural gas. According to data from the Central Intelligence Agency, more than 66% of world electric generation comes from fossil fuels today.\nIn contrast, renewable energy comes from sources that can be replenished faster than they are consumed.\nRenewable energy sources produce little to no greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change, even when considering their life cycle emissions that occur through each stage of the technology\u2019s use.\nAside from relying on dwindling and expensive resources, non-renewable energy sources \u2014 specifically, fossil fuel combustion \u2014 create vast harm by releasing toxic air pollution and greenhouse gases that threaten air quality and climate health.\nEstimates from Harvard calculate that air pollution from fossil fuels may be responsible for as many as one in five deaths worldwide. Air pollution from coal-fired power plants impacts not only people in the immediate vicinity but can travel long distances depending on the prevailing wind speed and direction and put large portions of the population at risk.\nThe most common renewable energy sources include wind, solar, and geothermal with two of the safest and most common being wind and solar.\nWind energy is created using wind turbines which can be placed anywhere with high-speed winds, including hilltops to open water. Wind energy is one of the cleanest sources of energy because wind turbines do not affect air pollution emissions in any direct way and do not need water for cooling.\nSolar energy, which uses solar or photovoltaic cells to convert sunlight into electricity, is also very clean in that it doesn\u2019t produce air pollutants or contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. However, the process of manufacturing solar panels may produce some emissions.\nGeothermal energy relies on the heat produced within the Earth. Water is injected deep underground and is heated by the Earth\u2019s molten interior and returns as hot water or steam; this steam is used to power a turbine to generate electricity. Geothermal energy produces only one-sixth of the carbon dioxide of a natural gas powerplant and little to no NO2 or SO2 pollution.\nWhile biomass is sometimes listed as a source of renewable energy, the American Lung Association opposes biomass combustion as a form of energy generation because this process creates particle pollution and releases other carcinogens. However, pyrolysis \u2014 where biomass is heated in an anaerobic environment without oxygen, breaking down into oils and gases \u2014 is a potential alternative to incineration that is known to produce fewer air pollutants than burning.\nAn exciting future may exist when it comes to nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion, a process where light elements are combined to form heavier elements and release energy in the process, made recent headlines due to a scientific breakthrough where scientists demonstrated a positive energy gain in the reaction for the first time.\nHowever, we\u2019re still far from being able to use nuclear fusion as a viable energy source. Though this process can not yet be practically applied commercially, it holds the potential for a clean, safe, carbon-free, and near-limitless source of energy in the future.\nRenewable energy use is growing across the globe but unfortunately still accounts for just a portion of overall energy generation.\nGlobally, even though fossil fuels still account for the majority of energy production, renewable energy sources now make up 29% of current electricity production.\nIn the United States, 29% of greenhouse gas emissions come from electricity production, particularly from fossil fuel combustion. However, the U.S. is increasing its use of nonfossil fuel sources of energy, with 21% of the country\u2019s energy consumption coming from renewable sources in 2020 \u2014 the highest share since the early 1900s.\nBy increasing the supply and use of renewable energy like wind and solar, we can replace carbon-intensive sources like fossil fuels and lower the amount of greenhouse gas emissions released.\nAir pollution is a severe global crisis, with the World Health Organi\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

We investigated community resilience during transitions, focusing on three fossil-fuel-dependent Wyoming communities during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFull Page Content:\nInsight and inspiration in turbulent times.\nBy Yogi Hendlin, originally published by Resilience.org\nFebruary 14, 2023\nFor some years now, the principle job I\u2019ve had at my university, aside from the teaching and research, has been triaging the attachments of fossil fuels apologists.\nOf course, many scholars have proposed a shift from industrial civilization to ecological civilization, but often because the pre-framing of apologists hinges upon the industrial civilization-barbarism dichotomy, any alternative is perceived as an identity threat. Because of this trauma response, I have spent the last half decade as a hospice priest for the fossil fuel industry.\nGoing from the progressive spirit of California, where I grew up and studied in the Bay Area, to the conservative if tolerating colonial power of the Netherlands has been jarring. Aside from the prevalent if well-meaning racism, unconscious sexism, and the general consensus that everyone\u2019s so comfortable formidable barriers prevent discussing the country\u2019s violent history and present extractivism, this is a country \u2013 like all under global capitalism \u2013 firmly addicted to fossil fuels. At least in California, with its progressive state and local governments, we pretend that we were prioritizing equity and the environment. But here, there is no conceit. Instead, in most places around the world \u2013 but especially in the Global North \u2013 at all levels of power we\u2019re surrounded by those who defend the fossil fuel industry tooth and nail.\nDo I resent the fact that I\u2019ve had to pander to the insecurities and cowardice of too-comfortable and too-numbed bureaucrats? Of course I do. Only a saint would be able to administer such services without a trace of resentment. But is it worth it to create a slightly less horrible world, which might enable others to take further steps in an ecological direction easier? Absolutely.\nThe process I\u2019ve had to undergo in the midst of working with soft climate-change denialists is a spiritual battle of looking at my own shit \u2013 my own frustrations, resentments, angers, and fears. It has really challenged my own behavioral patterns so that I become less reactive, in order to not trigger the reactiveness of armed-to-the-teeth defense and trigger mechanisms of others. It has been a spiritual practice to not react to the snowflake fossil fuel defenders.\nDialoging with those so attached to their fossil fuel masters has forced me to become even less attached to the outcomes I know are best, and to work with the broken reality as it is. Even though this glacial tempo of progress sucks for the world, dancing around their kryptonite has given me an evolutionary boost. I have been gifted with opportunities for spiritual fortification I would never have encountered in the work world, had my colleagues learned more about the science of climate change or had learned how to empathize with those most effected by pollution. Their lack of growth in this area has required me to grow double. Not just in terms of information, but in empathy. Empathizing for those believing falsely that they are benefiting from the current ecocidal system, even as they are deeply unhappy and know not where the lack of meaning in their lives comes from.\n[slide-anything id=\u20193472166\u2032]\nObserving these habits has been instructive. What are we defending when we make excuses for continued extractivism which flies in the face of all science, and our own lived experience?\nI\u2019ve come to believe that those defending fossil fuels are defending their families, friends, acquaintances who have worked in and benefited from fossil fuels, and most of all their lifestyles of comfort.\nBut beyond this, there is an emotional connection. After all, they tell us: \u201cif we divested from fossil fuels, everything would stop working.\u201d Commerce would grind to a standstill, and chaos would ensure. Plus, how ungrateful for us to dismiss all of the goods that fossil fuels have brought us! Cars are very convenient, after all, and would we prefer to freeze through the winter?\nAll of these common rejoinders \u2013 often recycling arguments posited by the fossil fuel industries themselves going back to the 1960s \u2013 boil down to a single logical fallacy: that the only way to get \u2018the goods\u2019 which are non-negotiable to continue according to our accustomed way of meeting our needs is through maintaining fossil fuels. Through coupling life as we know it with turning a blind eye to the details or consequences of fossil fuel extractivism, it is as if we are asking these good people to choose between industrial civilization and barbarism, and the fear of the latter drives the white-knuckling defenders to overlook the gratuitious harms of the former.\nIt\u2019s Unfair that we Prioritize Appeasing Fragile Imperial Egos, but Absolutely Necessary\nWhite fragility signals the reactiveness and defensiveness white people who have not contextualized their own privilege experience when confronted by their own racial entitlements in a racist system. It references the inordinate time and emotional labor involved in as one being oppressed by the power hierarchies of normalized groups to educate the oppressors in the ways that they are harming themselves but mostly others. And it deals with the unfairness in making the responsibility for restitution and movement towards justice by those same groups who are already definitionally the \u2018have-nots\u2019 of racialized caste systems\nLet\u2019s see how this works modulated to the environmental crisis. In a recent interview, Rose Abramoff, Earth Scientist and Climate Activist with Scientist Rebellion recently fired from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory for demonstrating at the 2022 American Geophysical Union conference, said:\n\u201cThat seems interesting to me, that we allow the fossil fuel industry, economists, politicians, celebrities, random people on the internet, the youth which are leading the climate movement \u2013 everyone has a stake, and a right to comment on these climate policies; except it \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

While bioenergy supply increases ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nJune 25, 2025\nHighlights:\nAI/Data Center Resources\nData centers have a thirst for water, and their rapid expansion threatens freshwater supplies. Only 3% of Earth\u2019s water is freshwater, and only 0.5% of all water is accessible and safe for human consumption. Freshwater is critical for survival. On average, a human being can live without water for only three days. Increasing drought and water shortages are reducing water availability. Meanwhile, data center developers are increasingly tapping into surface and underground aquifers to cool their facilities.\nData center water usage closely parallels energy usage and carbon emissions. As data centers use more energy for their typical data center operations and to meet AI requests, they consume larger amounts of water to cool their processor chips, so as to avoid overheating and potential damage. Similarly, as energy use increases in data centers, so do carbon emissions.\nA medium-sized data center can consume up to roughly 110 million gallons of water per year for cooling purposes, equivalent to the annual water usage of approximately 1,000 households. Larger data centers can each \u201cdrink\u201d up to 5 million gallons per day, or about 1.8 billion annually, usage equivalent to a town of 10,000 to 50,000 people. Together, the nation\u2019s 5,426 data centers consume billions of gallons of water annually. One report estimated that U.S. data centers consume 449 million gallons of water per day and 163.7 billion gallons annually (as of 2021). A 2016 report found that fewer than one-third of data center operators track water consumption. Water consumption is expected to continue increasing as data centers grow in number, size, and complexity.\nAccording to scientists at the University of California, Riverside, each 100-word AI prompt is estimated to use roughly one bottle of water (or 519 milliliters). This may not sound like much, but billions of AI users worldwide enter prompts into systems like ChatGPT every minute. Large language models require many energy-intensive calculations, necessitating liquid cooling systems.\nThe Water Cycle of Data Centers\nA data center\u2019s water footprint is calculated as the sum of three categories: on-site water usage, water use by power plant facilities that supply power to data centers, and water consumption during the manufacturing process of processor chips. Water can come from various sources, including blue sources (e.g., surface water and groundwater), piped sources such as municipal water, and gray sources (e.g., purified reclaimed water). Using recycled or non-potable water to meet a data center\u2019s cooling needs is a well-established practice to conserve limited potable water resources, particularly in dry or drought-prone areas.\nIn the context of data centers, \u201cwater consumption\u201d refers to the amount of water withdrawn from blue or gray sources minus the water discharged by the centers (primarily warm water left over from cooling the IT racks). The consumed water is generally the water that evaporates or is otherwise taken out of immediate human usage. Withdrawal of fresh water from local streams or underground aquifers may lead to aquifer exhaustion, particularly in water-stressed areas.\nResearchers at The Green Grid, a nonprofit industry consortium, developed a metric called Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE) to measure water usage by data centers. Similar to the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) metric, which measures the energy efficiency of a data center, the WUE metric assesses the efficiency of a data center\u2019s water use. WUE is reported in liters per kilowatt-hour (kWh): a data center\u2019s total water consumption, measured in liters, is divided by the total energy consumed by that data center in kilowatt-hours in the same time period. While \u201c0\u201d is the ideal WUE score, this can only be achieved in air-cooled data centers, and most data centers cannot meet this target due to their location\u2019s climate conditions. The average WUE across data centers is 1.9 liters per kWh, which is a great goal to beat.\nData centers' water usage depends on various factors, including location, climate, water availability, size, and IT rack chip densities. In hotter climates, like in the southwest United States, data centers need to use more water to cool the building and equipment. With the increasing number of centers supporting AI requests, chip density is also growing, which leads to higher room temperatures, necessitating the use of more water chillers at the server level to maintain cool temperatures. Most data centers use a combination of chillers and on-site cooling towers to avoid chip overheating.\nCooling data centers is a complex operation. At the server level, water chillers cool IT rooms to maintain optimal temperatures and prevent damage to chips. This can be achieved through air cooling using water evaporation, which is an open-loop and more water-intensive method, or through server liquid cooling. Server cooling is a more expensive approach that delivers the liquid coolant directly to the graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs). Direct-to-chip liquid cooling and immersive liquid cooling are two standard server liquid cooling technologies that dissipate heat while significantly reducing water consumption. During immersive cooling, water or specialized synthetic liquids flood the chips, absorbing the heat. The difference between direct server liquid cooling and air cooling through evaporation can be compared to the difference between drip irrigation and flooding in agriculture.\nIn areas with limited water availability, server liquid cooling is the best choice, as it requires minimal water consumption. Conversely, in areas with a strained power grid, an evaporative air cooling tower is a suitable building design, as it requires minimal power usage.\nRegardless of the approach chosen, a heat exchanger is necessary to capture the hot air or hot water produced as a byproduct of the cooling process.

Take away oil, coal, ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nInsight and inspiration in turbulent times.\nBy Yogi Hendlin, originally published by Resilience.org\nFebruary 14, 2023\nFor some years now, the principle job I\u2019ve had at my university, aside from the teaching and research, has been triaging the attachments of fossil fuels apologists.\nOf course, many scholars have proposed a shift from industrial civilization to ecological civilization, but often because the pre-framing of apologists hinges upon the industrial civilization-barbarism dichotomy, any alternative is perceived as an identity threat. Because of this trauma response, I have spent the last half decade as a hospice priest for the fossil fuel industry.\nGoing from the progressive spirit of California, where I grew up and studied in the Bay Area, to the conservative if tolerating colonial power of the Netherlands has been jarring. Aside from the prevalent if well-meaning racism, unconscious sexism, and the general consensus that everyone\u2019s so comfortable formidable barriers prevent discussing the country\u2019s violent history and present extractivism, this is a country \u2013 like all under global capitalism \u2013 firmly addicted to fossil fuels. At least in California, with its progressive state and local governments, we pretend that we were prioritizing equity and the environment. But here, there is no conceit. Instead, in most places around the world \u2013 but especially in the Global North \u2013 at all levels of power we\u2019re surrounded by those who defend the fossil fuel industry tooth and nail.\nDo I resent the fact that I\u2019ve had to pander to the insecurities and cowardice of too-comfortable and too-numbed bureaucrats? Of course I do. Only a saint would be able to administer such services without a trace of resentment. But is it worth it to create a slightly less horrible world, which might enable others to take further steps in an ecological direction easier? Absolutely.\nThe process I\u2019ve had to undergo in the midst of working with soft climate-change denialists is a spiritual battle of looking at my own shit \u2013 my own frustrations, resentments, angers, and fears. It has really challenged my own behavioral patterns so that I become less reactive, in order to not trigger the reactiveness of armed-to-the-teeth defense and trigger mechanisms of others. It has been a spiritual practice to not react to the snowflake fossil fuel defenders.\nDialoging with those so attached to their fossil fuel masters has forced me to become even less attached to the outcomes I know are best, and to work with the broken reality as it is. Even though this glacial tempo of progress sucks for the world, dancing around their kryptonite has given me an evolutionary boost. I have been gifted with opportunities for spiritual fortification I would never have encountered in the work world, had my colleagues learned more about the science of climate change or had learned how to empathize with those most effected by pollution. Their lack of growth in this area has required me to grow double. Not just in terms of information, but in empathy. Empathizing for those believing falsely that they are benefiting from the current ecocidal system, even as they are deeply unhappy and know not where the lack of meaning in their lives comes from.\n[slide-anything id=\u20193472166\u2032]\nObserving these habits has been instructive. What are we defending when we make excuses for continued extractivism which flies in the face of all science, and our own lived experience?\nI\u2019ve come to believe that those defending fossil fuels are defending their families, friends, acquaintances who have worked in and benefited from fossil fuels, and most of all their lifestyles of comfort.\nBut beyond this, there is an emotional connection. After all, they tell us: \u201cif we divested from fossil fuels, everything would stop working.\u201d Commerce would grind to a standstill, and chaos would ensure. Plus, how ungrateful for us to dismiss all of the goods that fossil fuels have brought us! Cars are very convenient, after all, and would we prefer to freeze through the winter?\nAll of these common rejoinders \u2013 often recycling arguments posited by the fossil fuel industries themselves going back to the 1960s \u2013 boil down to a single logical fallacy: that the only way to get \u2018the goods\u2019 which are non-negotiable to continue according to our accustomed way of meeting our needs is through maintaining fossil fuels. Through coupling life as we know it with turning a blind eye to the details or consequences of fossil fuel extractivism, it is as if we are asking these good people to choose between industrial civilization and barbarism, and the fear of the latter drives the white-knuckling defenders to overlook the gratuitious harms of the former.\nIt\u2019s Unfair that we Prioritize Appeasing Fragile Imperial Egos, but Absolutely Necessary\nWhite fragility signals the reactiveness and defensiveness white people who have not contextualized their own privilege experience when confronted by their own racial entitlements in a racist system. It references the inordinate time and emotional labor involved in as one being oppressed by the power hierarchies of normalized groups to educate the oppressors in the ways that they are harming themselves but mostly others. And it deals with the unfairness in making the responsibility for restitution and movement towards justice by those same groups who are already definitionally the \u2018have-nots\u2019 of racialized caste systems\nLet\u2019s see how this works modulated to the environmental crisis. In a recent interview, Rose Abramoff, Earth Scientist and Climate Activist with Scientist Rebellion recently fired from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory for demonstrating at the 2022 American Geophysical Union conference, said:\n\u201cThat seems interesting to me, that we allow the fossil fuel industry, economists, politicians, celebrities, random people on the internet, the youth which are leading the climate movement \u2013 everyone has a stake, and a right to comment on these climate policies; except it \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

These costs are known as externalities. Each stage of the fossil fuel supply chain, from extraction and transportation to refining and burning, generates externalities. This fact sheet provides a survey of some of the externalities associated with fossil fuels.\nWhen fossil fuels are burned, they emit greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide that trap heat in the earth\u2019s atmosphere and contribute to climate change. In 2019, fossil fuels accounted for 74 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Nearly 25 percent of emissions in the United States come from fossil fuels extracted from public lands. Some of the climate externalities of fossil fuels include:\nFossil fuels have significant environmental externalities including:\nAir pollution from burning fossil fuels can cause multiple health issues, including asthma, cancer, heart disease, and premature death. Combusting the additives found in gasoline\u2014benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene\u2014produces cancer-causing ultra-fine particles and aromatic hydrocarbons. Globally, fossil fuel pollution is responsible for one in five deaths. In the United States, 350,000 premature deaths in 2018 were attributed to fossil fuel-related pollution, with the highest number of deaths per capita in states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia. The annual cost of the health impacts of fossil fuel-generated electricity in the United States is estimated to be up to $886.5 billion.\nThe environmental and health impacts of fossil fuels disproportionately harm communities of color and low-income communities. Black and Hispanic Americans are exposed to 56 and 63 percent more particulate matter pollution, respectively, than they produce. In a predominantly Black and low-income area of Louisiana known as \u201cCancer Alley,\u201d the cancer risk is nearly 50 times higher than the national average due to 150 nearby chemical plants and oil refineries.\nSeveral policy mechanisms have been proposed to reduce fossil fuel externalities, including:\nAuthor: Savannah Bertrand\nEditor: Anna McGinn\nGraphic: Emma Johnson\nFor the endnotes, please download the PDF version of this issue brief.\nEESI RSS Feed\n1020 19th Street, NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20036-6101\n(202) 628-1400 phone (202) 204-5244 fax\ninfo@eesi.org Staff directory EIN: 52-1268030\nEESI advances science-based solutions for climate change, energy, and environmental challenges in order to achieve our vision of a sustainable, resilient, and equitable world.\nMore about EESI\nCopyright \u00a9 Environmental and Energy Study Institute (EESI).

Only 3% of Earth\u2019s water is freshwater, and only 0.5% of all water is accessible and safe for human consumption. Freshwater is critical for survival. On average, a human being can live without water for only three days. Increasing drought and water shortages are reducing water availability. Meanwhile, data center developers are increasingly tapping into surface and underground aquifers to cool their facilities.\nData center water usage closely parallels energy usage and carbon emissions. As data centers use more energy for their typical data center operations and to meet AI requests, they consume larger amounts of water to cool their processor chips, so as to avoid overheating and potential damage. Similarly, as energy use increases in data centers, so do carbon emissions.\nA medium-sized data center can consume up to roughly 110 million gallons of water per year for cooling purposes, equivalent to the annual water usage of approximately 1,000 households. Larger data centers can each \u201cdrink\u201d up to 5 million gallons per day, or about 1.8 billion annually, usage equivalent to a town of 10,000 to 50,000 people. Together, the nation\u2019s 5,426 data centers consume billions of gallons of water annually. One report estimated that U.S. data centers consume 449 million gallons of water per day and 163.7 billion gallons annually (as of 2021). A 2016 report found that fewer than one-third of data center operators track water consumption. Water consumption is expected to continue increasing as data centers grow in number, size, and complexity.\nAccording to scientists at the University of California, Riverside, each 100-word AI prompt is estimated to use roughly one bottle of water (or 519 milliliters). This may not sound like much, but billions of AI users worldwide enter prompts into systems like ChatGPT every minute. Large language models require many energy-intensive calculations, necessitating liquid cooling systems.\nThe Water Cycle of Data Centers\nA data center\u2019s water footprint is calculated as the sum of three categories: on-site water usage, water use by power plant facilities that supply power to data centers, and water consumption during the manufacturing process of processor chips. Water can come from various sources, including blue sources (e.g., surface water and groundwater), piped sources such as municipal water, and gray sources (e.g., purified reclaimed water). Using recycled or non-potable water to meet a data center\u2019s cooling needs is a well-established practice to conserve limited potable water resources, particularly in dry or drought-prone areas.\nIn the context of data centers, \u201cwater consumption\u201d refers to the amount of water withdrawn from blue or gray sources minus the water discharged by the centers (primarily warm water left over from cooling the IT racks). The consumed water is generally the water that evaporates or is otherwise taken out of immediate human usage. Withdrawal of fresh water from local streams or underground aquifers may lead to aquifer exhaustion, particularly in water-stressed areas.\nResearchers at The Green Grid, a nonprofit industry consortium, developed a metric called Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE) to measure water usage by data centers. Similar to the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) metric, which measures the energy efficiency of a data center, the WUE metric assesses the efficiency of a data center\u2019s water use. WUE is reported in liters per kilowatt-hour (kWh): a data center\u2019s total water consumption, measured in liters, is divided by the total energy consumed by that data center in kilowatt-hours in the same time period. While \u201c0\u201d is the ideal WUE score, this can only be achieved in air-cooled data centers, and most data centers cannot meet this target due to their location\u2019s climate conditions. The average WUE across data centers is 1.9 liters per kWh, which is a great goal to beat.\nData centers' water usage depends on various factors, including location, climate, water availability, size, and IT rack chip densities. In hotter climates, like in the southwest United States, data centers need to use more water to cool the building and equipment. With the increasing number of centers supporting AI requests, chip density is also growing, which leads to higher room temperatures, necessitating the use of more water chillers at the server level to maintain cool temperatures. Most data centers use a combination of chillers and on-site cooling towers to avoid chip overheating.\nCooling data centers is a complex operation. At the server level, water chillers cool IT rooms to maintain optimal temperatures and prevent damage to chips. This can be achieved through air cooling using water evaporation, which is an open-loop and more water-intensive method, or through server liquid cooling. Server cooling is a more expensive approach that delivers the liquid coolant directly to the graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs). Direct-to-chip liquid cooling and immersive liquid cooling are two standard server liquid cooling technologies that dissipate heat while significantly reducing water consumption. During immersive cooling, water or specialized synthetic liquids flood the chips, absorbing the heat. The difference between direct server liquid cooling and air cooling through evaporation can be compared to the difference between drip irrigation and flooding in agriculture.\nIn areas with limited water availability, server liquid cooling is the best choice, as it requires minimal water consumption. Conversely, in areas with a strained power grid, an evaporative air cooling tower is a suitable building design, as it requires minimal power usage.\nRegardless of the approach chosen, a heat exchanger is necessary to capture the hot air or hot water produced as a byproduct of the cooling process. Hot water \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

In fact, the energy sector accounts for roughly 10% of all global freshwater withdrawals. Meanwhile, energy is crucial to maintaining global water supply. It is needed to extract water from lakes, rivers and oceans; lift groundwater from aquifers and pump it through pipes and canals; and treat water and deliver it to users.\nThis interdependence is set to intensify in the coming years. Each resource faces rising demand and growing constraints in many regions because of economic and population growth, as well as climate change. This has significant implications for ensuring both energy and water security.\nEnergy's water problem\nAlmost all of the world\u2019s water demand is met by groundwater and surface water. However, water stress has led to an increase in the use of non-traditional resources, such as saltwater. This requires desalination, the process of separating saline water (seawater or brackish water) into freshwater and concentrated salt.\nGlobal energy demand for desalination has nearly doubled since 2010, and current trends point to another doubling to 2030. Some 21,000 desalination plants currently operate in about 150 countries, from the United States and China to Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia \u2013 though half of global installed capacity is located in the Middle East and North Africa.\nIn a scenario in which global energy sector emissions reach net zero by 2050, water withdrawals by the energy sector decline by almost 20 bcm by 2030. The biggest reductions happen in the power sector, where withdrawals fall nearly 15% as coal-fired power generation is quickly replaced by solar PV and wind. Greater energy efficiency also plays an important role in reducing the volume of water needed to meet global energy demand.\nCommentary \u2014 04 November 2025\nCommentary \u2014 22 March 2024\nCommentary \u2014 22 March 2023\nEvent \u2014 14 Nov 2022 09:30\u201410:30\nCommentary \u2014 22 March 2022\nThe best of the IEA sent straight to your inbox\nTop energy experts put IEA analysis in context\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

These co-pollutants react with ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nThe emissions from fossil fuel use not only affect climate but also affects air pollution both directly (emitting primary particles) and indirectly (emitting precursors for formation of ozone [O3] and particulates). Effects on ozone and particulates (especially PM2.5) are of major concern because of their adverse health effects on human and other life on Earth. Although alternative energy use is increasing, the impacts are not yet large enough to reduce the poor air quality resulting from extensive use of fossil fuels and resulting emissions in much of the world. A more definite energy transformation is needed to reduce these health impacts. Here, we examine the possibility of a midcentury future, where, because of its influence on climate, fossil fuel use has been extensively reduced in much of the world, and replaced by nonpolluting forms of energy. Analyses of the clean energy future globally and in five regions across the world, including 29 megacities, show that air quality with respect to ozone and particulate pollution improves significantly. When compared to the high-emission future under the clean energy scenario, population weighted ozone, and particulate matter exposure are reduced by >40% and 50%, respectively. The number air quality noncompliance events, defined by exceedance days and air quality index (AQI), improved considerably under the clean energy scenario. Annually, exceedance days are reduced to 0.7% \u00b1 1.7% for ozone pollution and 7.4% \u00b1 17.8% for particulate pollution under the clean energy scenario. AQI always stayed above the \u201cvery unhealthy category\u201d and are improved significantly for the \u201cunhealthy category\u201d in all regions. Overall major hotspots experienced significantly cleaner air under the clean energy scenario, emphasizing the significance of transforming energy production, and moving away from conventional use of fossil fuels, on air quality and human health.\nFossil fuel emission increases the burden of air pollutants like ozone and particulate matter which have adverse effect on human health. Unchecked use of fossil fuels will expose more people to poor air quality. In this study, we explore a clean energy future, where, by midcentury, fossil fuel usage has been completely eliminated except for biomass burning. The study shows how a fossil fuel free clean energy future, reduces air quality issues significantly. Future planning on adapting to newer energy should take these results into consideration.\nThe transformation to fossil fuel free energy and transportation systems would greatly improve air quality throughout the world\nLocations known for air quality noncompliance and associated health issues would be almost completely compliant by midcentury under a clean energy transformation\nThe significant reduction in exposure to poor air quality is a major incentive toward moving to a cleaner energy world\nPoor air quality has a significant negative impact on human health. Of particular concern globally are ground level concentrations of ozone (O3) and fine particles, especially those smaller than 2.5 microns (PM2.5). Conventional energy sources like coal, oil, and natural gas (all referred to hereafter as fossil fuels), and associated products like gasoline and diesel fuel used in transportation, along with biomass burning, are major contributors to air pollution. The use of fossil fuels in energy production and transportation is also the most important contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, contributing >80% of the human-related emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and is a major source of methane (CH4), the two gases of most concern to the changing climate (IPCC, 2013, 2018, 2021; NCA4, 2017, 2018). This use of fossil fuels also contributes both directly (emitting primary particles like black carbon (BC)) and indirectly (emitting precursors for ozone and other particulates like sulfates and nitrates). Fossil fuel use is a major anthropogenic source of emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and other gases and particles that contribute to air pollution levels. In much of the last century, these pollutants had significant impact on global human health, ranging from increased cardio-pulmonary disease to premature deaths (Brauer et al., 2015; Burnett et al., 2014; Clarke et al., 2007; Dockery et al., 1993; Edwards et al., 2017; Evans et al., 2017; Feigin et al., 2016; Healy et al., 2017; Jerrett et al., 2005; Khomenko et al., 2021; Lei et al., 2020; Lelieveld et al., 2019; Lim et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2019; Markandya et al., 2018; Schraufnagel et al., 2018, 2019; Smith & Wigley, 2006; Weyant et al., 2019). The health effects are not just restricted to cardio-pulmonary diseases; recent studies have indicated links of air pollution to Parkinson's disease (Han et al., 2020), urinary tract infection (Gu et al., 2020), increased brain inflammation, dementia, Alzheimer's disease (Ilango & Shaffer, 2020; Peeples, 2020; Stower, 2021), increased risk for psychiatric disorders, depression, anxiety (Braithwaite et al., 2019), and reduced fertility and miscarriages (Veras et al., 2010).\nAccording to the World Health Association (WHO) website, seven million premature deaths were attributed to air pollution in 2016, with 4.2 million premature deaths due to ambient air pollution. Vohra et al. (2021) suggests this is a major underestimate and the air quality impacts could be as large as 8.6 million premature deaths in 2018 due to outdoor particles alone. Landrigan et al. (2018) estimate approximately 4.2 million death could be attributed to particulate pollution and 0.3 million to ambient ozone pollution with disproportional effects on the poor. Burnett et al. (2018) estimate 8.9 million deaths in 2015 associated only to particulate pollution.

Effects on ozone and particulates (especially PM2.5) are of major concern because of their adverse health effects on human and other life on Earth. Although alternative energy use is increasing, the impacts are not yet large enough to reduce the poor air quality resulting from extensive use of fossil fuels and resulting emissions in much of the world. A more definite energy transformation is needed to reduce these health impacts. Here, we examine the possibility of a midcentury future, where, because of its influence on climate, fossil fuel use has been extensively reduced in much of the world, and replaced by nonpolluting forms of energy. Analyses of the clean energy future globally and in five regions across the world, including 29 megacities, show that air quality with respect to ozone and particulate pollution improves significantly. When compared to the high-emission future under the clean energy scenario, population weighted ozone, and particulate matter exposure are reduced by >40% and 50%, respectively. The number air quality noncompliance events, defined by exceedance days and air quality index (AQI), improved considerably under the clean energy scenario. Annually, exceedance days are reduced to 0.7% \u00b1 1.7% for ozone pollution and 7.4% \u00b1 17.8% for particulate pollution under the clean energy scenario. AQI always stayed above the \u201cvery unhealthy category\u201d and are improved significantly for the \u201cunhealthy category\u201d in all regions. Overall major hotspots experienced significantly cleaner air under the clean energy scenario, emphasizing the significance of transforming energy production, and moving away from conventional use of fossil fuels, on air quality and human health.\nFossil fuel emission increases the burden of air pollutants like ozone and particulate matter which have adverse effect on human health. Unchecked use of fossil fuels will expose more people to poor air quality. In this study, we explore a clean energy future, where, by midcentury, fossil fuel usage has been completely eliminated except for biomass burning. The study shows how a fossil fuel free clean energy future, reduces air quality issues significantly. Future planning on adapting to newer energy should take these results into consideration.\nThe transformation to fossil fuel free energy and transportation systems would greatly improve air quality throughout the world\nLocations known for air quality noncompliance and associated health issues would be almost completely compliant by midcentury under a clean energy transformation\nThe significant reduction in exposure to poor air quality is a major incentive toward moving to a cleaner energy world\nPoor air quality has a significant negative impact on human health. Of particular concern globally are ground level concentrations of ozone (O3) and fine particles, especially those smaller than 2.5 microns (PM2.5). Conventional energy sources like coal, oil, and natural gas (all referred to hereafter as fossil fuels), and associated products like gasoline and diesel fuel used in transportation, along with biomass burning, are major contributors to air pollution. The use of fossil fuels in energy production and transportation is also the most important contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, contributing >80% of the human-related emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and is a major source of methane (CH4), the two gases of most concern to the changing climate (IPCC, 2013, 2018, 2021; NCA4, 2017, 2018). This use of fossil fuels also contributes both directly (emitting primary particles like black carbon (BC)) and indirectly (emitting precursors for ozone and other particulates like sulfates and nitrates). Fossil fuel use is a major anthropogenic source of emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and other gases and particles that contribute to air pollution levels. In much of the last century, these pollutants had significant impact on global human health, ranging from increased cardio-pulmonary disease to premature deaths (Brauer et al., 2015; Burnett et al., 2014; Clarke et al., 2007; Dockery et al., 1993; Edwards et al., 2017; Evans et al., 2017; Feigin et al., 2016; Healy et al., 2017; Jerrett et al., 2005; Khomenko et al., 2021; Lei et al., 2020; Lelieveld et al., 2019; Lim et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2019; Markandya et al., 2018; Schraufnagel et al., 2018, 2019; Smith & Wigley, 2006; Weyant et al., 2019).

In fact, the energy sector accounts for roughly 10% of all global freshwater withdrawals. Meanwhile, energy is crucial to maintaining global water supply. It is needed to extract water from lakes, rivers and oceans; lift groundwater from aquifers and pump it through pipes and canals; and treat water and deliver it to users.\nThis interdependence is set to intensify in the coming years. Each resource faces rising demand and growing constraints in many regions because of economic and population growth, as well as climate change. This has significant implications for ensuring both energy and water security.\nEnergy's water problem\nAlmost all of the world\u2019s water demand is met by groundwater and surface water. However, water stress has led to an increase in the use of non-traditional resources, such as saltwater. This requires desalination, the process of separating saline water (seawater or brackish water) into freshwater and concentrated salt.\nGlobal energy demand for desalination has nearly doubled since 2010, and current trends point to another doubling to 2030. Some 21,000 desalination plants currently operate in about 150 countries, from the United States and China to Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia \u2013 though half of global installed capacity is located in the Middle East and North Africa.\nIn a scenario in which global energy sector emissions reach net zero by 2050, water withdrawals by the energy sector decline by almost 20 bcm by 2030. The biggest reductions happen in the power sector, where withdrawals fall nearly 15% as coal-fired power generation is quickly replaced by solar PV and wind. Greater energy efficiency also plays an important role in reducing the volume of water needed to meet global energy demand.\nCommentary \u2014 04 November 2025\nCommentary \u2014 22 March 2024\nCommentary \u2014 22 March 2023\nEvent \u2014 14 Nov 2022 09:30\u201410:30\nCommentary \u2014 22 March 2022\nThe best of the IEA sent straight to your inbox\nTop energy experts put IEA analysis in context\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Clean water supports healthy ecosystems, which provide important goods and services for human consumption and enjoyment. Water is also essential to meet modern needs\u2014to generate the energy required to heat and cool homes, process transportation fuels, manufacture and transport the goods we consume and support communication networks. With the threats of climate change and a growing global population, the demand for clean and reliable water supplies is on the rise. As water is essential for people, ecosystems, and industries, this valuable resource is central to the energy-water-food nexus.\nThis section describes how energy and food/land are inputs to water. Learn more here on how water is an input for energy, and here how water is an input for the food sector.\nA key consideration for water is not just the quantity available but also whether the quality of the water is suitable for its intended purpose. Extreme climate conditions, such as drought or flooding, and human activity, such as fracking or agricultural pesticide use, all impact the quality of water available for use. As water quality deteriorates, there is a greater need for highly energy intensive treatment technologies, such as desalination of drinking water and ultraviolet disinfection of wastewater to make the water suitable for people and receiving waters. Drinking water and wastewater plants represent some of the largest energy consumption for local governments, accounting for 30%\u201340% of total energy consumed (\u201cState and Local Climate Energy Program,\u201d U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, State and Local Climate Energy Program). According to the International Energy Agency\u2019s World Energy Outlook 2016 (p. 379), the water sector\u2019s share of global electricity consumption is projected to be around 4% by 2040, which is roughly equal to the total energy consumption of Australia. However, in regions highly reliant on desalination, such as the Middle East, the electricity share is projected to increase from 9% in 2015 to 16% by 2040. Globally, of the electricity consumed for water, approximately 40% is used to extract ground and surface water, 25% is used for wastewater treatment and 20% is used for water distribution (World Energy Outlook 2016, p.347).\nEnergy use for water topics identify key considerations pertaining to the use of energy as an input to the water and wastewater sectors, including energy use for pumping, treatment, distribution, and conveyance of water and wastewater; water and wastewater system optimization and energy recovery; water quality, effluent quality, fit-for-purpose water, water efficiency, access to clean and reliable water supplies, urbanization, access to hygiene and sanitation, water system loss, energy efficiency, and demand response.\nFood for water topics identify key considerations pertaining to food or land as it influences the water and wastewater sectors. Land-use decisions pertaining to development density, plant and material selection, areas impervious to water infiltration, and irrigation practices, all affect the flow and resulting quality of runoff water, impacting surrounding ecosystems and receiving waters. \u201cDeclining water quality has become a global issue of concern as human populations grow, industrial and agricultural activities expand, and climate change threatens to cause major alterations to the hydrological cycle\u201d (\u201cWater Quality,\u201d International Decade for Water for Life 2005\u20132015, United Nations). In particular, human activities such as fertilizer and pesticide use for agriculture, directly impact the quality of runoff and the quality of water available for people and ecosystems. Irrigated agriculture is the world\u2019s largest water user, accounting for roughly 70% of total global freshwater withdrawals\u2014and up to 85% in some developing countries (World Energy Outlook 2016, p.351). Urbanization trends are also putting increasing demands on water while also impacting raw water quality and availability.\nLand use impacts for water topics identify key considerations pertaining to the impact of land use practices on the water and wastewater sectors, including water rights, watersheds, ecosystems, crop and plant selection, land use planning, urbanization, impervious area, material selection, irrigation practices, stormwater runoff, nonpoint-source pollution, and biofuels.\nWater is essential to the extraction of raw materials, and the processing, manufacture, and transport of goods. The main water consuming industries are discussed in under industry impacts, which include agriculture, thermoelectric power, and manufacturing. Industry is the second largest water consuming sector, after agricultural water use. In 2014, nearly 10% of global water withdrawals were for industrial use. This share is projected to remain steady over the next twenty years (World Energy Outlook 2016, p.352).\nThe water sector includes policies and best practices as they relate to the following key topics:\nPUBLICATION\nIEA\u2019s Energy Technology Perspectives 2024 report builds upon previous analysis, discussing the intersection of energy, manufacturing, and trade in regard\u2026\nSources:\nInternational Energy Agency\nDate:\n1 October 2024\nPUBLICATION\nThis paper reviews the fields of floatovoltaic technology (i.e., water-deployed solar photovoltaic systems) and aquaculture (i.e., farming of aquatic organisms)\u2026\nSources:\nRenewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews\nDate:\n1 December 2017\nPUBLICATION\nThis research explores which counties in Colorado may be best suited to reusing produced water for agriculture based on a\u2026\nSources:\nScience of the Total Environment\nDate:\n1 November 2018\nPUBLICATION\nThis article reviews city case studies to inform a framework for developing urban infrastructure design standards and policy instruments that\u2026\nSources:\nEnvironmental Progress and Sustainable Energy (AlChE)\nDate:\n3 November 2017\nTOOLS AND WEBSITES\nThe CWC studies how the wa\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Freshwater is critical for ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nJune 25, 2025\nHighlights:\nAI/Data Center Resources\nData centers have a thirst for water, and their rapid expansion threatens freshwater supplies. Only 3% of Earth\u2019s water is freshwater, and only 0.5% of all water is accessible and safe for human consumption. Freshwater is critical for survival. On average, a human being can live without water for only three days. Increasing drought and water shortages are reducing water availability. Meanwhile, data center developers are increasingly tapping into surface and underground aquifers to cool their facilities.\nData center water usage closely parallels energy usage and carbon emissions. As data centers use more energy for their typical data center operations and to meet AI requests, they consume larger amounts of water to cool their processor chips, so as to avoid overheating and potential damage. Similarly, as energy use increases in data centers, so do carbon emissions.\nA medium-sized data center can consume up to roughly 110 million gallons of water per year for cooling purposes, equivalent to the annual water usage of approximately 1,000 households. Larger data centers can each \u201cdrink\u201d up to 5 million gallons per day, or about 1.8 billion annually, usage equivalent to a town of 10,000 to 50,000 people. Together, the nation\u2019s 5,426 data centers consume billions of gallons of water annually. One report estimated that U.S. data centers consume 449 million gallons of water per day and 163.7 billion gallons annually (as of 2021). A 2016 report found that fewer than one-third of data center operators track water consumption. Water consumption is expected to continue increasing as data centers grow in number, size, and complexity.\nAccording to scientists at the University of California, Riverside, each 100-word AI prompt is estimated to use roughly one bottle of water (or 519 milliliters). This may not sound like much, but billions of AI users worldwide enter prompts into systems like ChatGPT every minute. Large language models require many energy-intensive calculations, necessitating liquid cooling systems.\nThe Water Cycle of Data Centers\nA data center\u2019s water footprint is calculated as the sum of three categories: on-site water usage, water use by power plant facilities that supply power to data centers, and water consumption during the manufacturing process of processor chips. Water can come from various sources, including blue sources (e.g., surface water and groundwater), piped sources such as municipal water, and gray sources (e.g., purified reclaimed water). Using recycled or non-potable water to meet a data center\u2019s cooling needs is a well-established practice to conserve limited potable water resources, particularly in dry or drought-prone areas.\nIn the context of data centers, \u201cwater consumption\u201d refers to the amount of water withdrawn from blue or gray sources minus the water discharged by the centers (primarily warm water left over from cooling the IT racks). The consumed water is generally the water that evaporates or is otherwise taken out of immediate human usage. Withdrawal of fresh water from local streams or underground aquifers may lead to aquifer exhaustion, particularly in water-stressed areas.\nResearchers at The Green Grid, a nonprofit industry consortium, developed a metric called Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE) to measure water usage by data centers. Similar to the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) metric, which measures the energy efficiency of a data center, the WUE metric assesses the efficiency of a data center\u2019s water use. WUE is reported in liters per kilowatt-hour (kWh): a data center\u2019s total water consumption, measured in liters, is divided by the total energy consumed by that data center in kilowatt-hours in the same time period. While \u201c0\u201d is the ideal WUE score, this can only be achieved in air-cooled data centers, and most data centers cannot meet this target due to their location\u2019s climate conditions. The average WUE across data centers is 1.9 liters per kWh, which is a great goal to beat.\nData centers' water usage depends on various factors, including location, climate, water availability, size, and IT rack chip densities. In hotter climates, like in the southwest United States, data centers need to use more water to cool the building and equipment. With the increasing number of centers supporting AI requests, chip density is also growing, which leads to higher room temperatures, necessitating the use of more water chillers at the server level to maintain cool temperatures. Most data centers use a combination of chillers and on-site cooling towers to avoid chip overheating.\nCooling data centers is a complex operation. At the server level, water chillers cool IT rooms to maintain optimal temperatures and prevent damage to chips. This can be achieved through air cooling using water evaporation, which is an open-loop and more water-intensive method, or through server liquid cooling. Server cooling is a more expensive approach that delivers the liquid coolant directly to the graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs). Direct-to-chip liquid cooling and immersive liquid cooling are two standard server liquid cooling technologies that dissipate heat while significantly reducing water consumption. During immersive cooling, water or specialized synthetic liquids flood the chips, absorbing the heat. The difference between direct server liquid cooling and air cooling through evaporation can be compared to the difference between drip irrigation and flooding in agriculture.\nIn areas with limited water availability, server liquid cooling is the best choice, as it requires minimal water consumption. Conversely, in areas with a strained power grid, an evaporative air cooling tower is a suitable building design, as it requires minimal power usage.\nRegardless of the approach chosen, a heat exchanger is necessary to capture the hot air or hot water produced as a byproduct of the cooling process.

It causes respiratory diseases, cardiovascular issues, and cancer, with 6.7 million premature deaths attributed to air pollution annually. This invisible threat exacerbates chronic conditions such as asthma and COPD, posing severe risks to public health.\nThe economic burden is substantial. Air pollution leads to increased healthcare costs and reduced labor productivity, straining public health systems and impacting industries like agriculture and tourism. These economic challenges contribute to a reduction in global GDP and an increase in public expenditure.\nEnvironmental degradation is another consequence of air pollution. It harms ecosystems, reduces biodiversity, and accelerates climate change. The urgency to address these issues is clear.\nThese impacts underscore the need for effective air quality improvement technologies to protect human health, preserve the environment, and support economic stability.\nAir pollution arises from both human activities and natural events.\nAnthropogenic sources dominate urban air pollution. Anthropogenic sources include:\nIndustrial Emissions: Factories and power plants release pollutants like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere. These emissions contribute significantly to smog and acid rain.\nVehicle Exhaust: Transportation remains a major contributor to air pollution. Combustion engines emit carbon monoxide, particulate matter, and volatile organic compounds, impacting urban air quality. Find out more about vehicle emissions monitoring strategies for reducing pollution in major cities.\nResidential Heating: The burning of fossil fuels for heating homes releases air pollutants. In many regions, the use of coal and wood exacerbates air quality issues, particularly in colder months.\nWaste Burning: Improper waste management and open burning of garbage release harmful toxins. This practice is prevalent in areas lacking adequate waste disposal infrastructure.\nNatural events also contribute to air pollution. Natural sources include:\nWildfires: These fires release large quantities of smoke and particulate matter, affecting air quality over vast regions.\nVolcanic Activity: Volcanic eruptions emit ash and gases like sulfur dioxide, which can influence global air conditions.\nTechnological solutions must be tailored to address these diverse sources. Effective intervention requires comprehensive monitoring and data analysis, such as the services provided by our Sensing-as-a-Service model, to mitigate the impact of these pollutants and improve air quality.\nEffective air quality monitoring faces significant challenges. Traditional reference-grade monitors are expensive, limiting their widespread deployment. These high costs create barriers for many regions, particularly in developing areas, hindering comprehensive monitoring efforts.\nGeographic coverage is another major issue. Limited numbers of monitors fail to provide the widespread data needed to understand air quality variations across different regions. Sparse monitoring networks can miss localized pollution events or trends, reducing the effectiveness of interventions.\nCapturing real-time localized air quality data is critical for timely responses but current systems often struggle with this. Conventional monitoring setups can lag in delivering data, impacting the ability to make informed decisions quickly. This lack of immediacy reduces the potential for proactive air quality management.\nThese challenges highlight the need for more accessible, scalable, and affordable monitoring technologies, including innovations such as low-cost sensors that expand geographic coverage and provide timely data.\nTechnological advancements in air pollution sensors are transforming environmental monitoring. Stationary low-cost sensors are now available, providing more accessible and widespread data collection than traditional methods. These sensors enable real-time monitoring, offering immediate insights into air quality conditions.\nLow-cost air quality sensors are compact and easily deployable, making them ideal for use in various settings, from urban environments to rural areas. They measure a range of pollutants, including particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone, providing comprehensive air quality data. They enable the detection of localized pollution events.\nThe benefits of stationary low-cost air quality sensors:\nThese innovations facilitate the identification of pollution hotspots. For additional context on integrating advanced sensor technologies within hybrid networks, see our comprehensive overview of evolving air quality monitoring technologies.\nSatellite technology provides comprehensive coverage of vast areas, including remote and underserved regions lacking ground-based infrastructure. Satellites equipped with advanced sensors capture high-resolution data on atmospheric pollutants. This enables understanding pollution trends and patterns on a global scale.\nSatellites provide continuous data collection over large geographical areas, crucial for monitoring transboundary pollution. Their ability to measure pollutants in the atmosphere offers insights into regional and global air quality dynamics. Satellite data complements ground-based systems, including stationary low-cost air sensors, enhancing the accuracy and coverage of air qual\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

It causes respiratory diseases, cardiovascular issues, and cancer, with 6.7 million premature deaths attributed to air pollution annually. This invisible threat exacerbates chronic conditions such as asthma and COPD, posing severe risks to public health.\nThe economic burden is substantial. Air pollution leads to increased healthcare costs and reduced labor productivity, straining public health systems and impacting industries like agriculture and tourism. These economic challenges contribute to a reduction in global GDP and an increase in public expenditure.\nEnvironmental degradation is another consequence of air pollution. It harms ecosystems, reduces biodiversity, and accelerates climate change. The urgency to address these issues is clear.\nThese impacts underscore the need for effective air quality improvement technologies to protect human health, preserve the environment, and support economic stability.\nAir pollution arises from both human activities and natural events.\nAnthropogenic sources dominate urban air pollution. Anthropogenic sources include:\nIndustrial Emissions: Factories and power plants release pollutants like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere. These emissions contribute significantly to smog and acid rain.\nVehicle Exhaust: Transportation remains a major contributor to air pollution. Combustion engines emit carbon monoxide, particulate matter, and volatile organic compounds, impacting urban air quality. Find out more about vehicle emissions monitoring strategies for reducing pollution in major cities.\nResidential Heating: The burning of fossil fuels for heating homes releases air pollutants. In many regions, the use of coal and wood exacerbates air quality issues, particularly in colder months.\nWaste Burning: Improper waste management and open burning of garbage release harmful toxins. This practice is prevalent in areas lacking adequate waste disposal infrastructure.\nNatural events also contribute to air pollution. Natural sources include:\nWildfires: These fires release large quantities of smoke and particulate matter, affecting air quality over vast regions.\nVolcanic Activity: Volcanic eruptions emit ash and gases like sulfur dioxide, which can influence global air conditions.\nTechnological solutions must be tailored to address these diverse sources. Effective intervention requires comprehensive monitoring and data analysis, such as the services provided by our Sensing-as-a-Service model, to mitigate the impact of these pollutants and improve air quality.\nEffective air quality monitoring faces significant challenges. Traditional reference-grade monitors are expensive, limiting their widespread deployment. These high costs create barriers for many regions, particularly in developing areas, hindering comprehensive monitoring efforts.\nGeographic coverage is another major issue. Limited numbers of monitors fail to provide the widespread data needed to understand air quality variations across different regions. Sparse monitoring networks can miss localized pollution events or trends, reducing the effectiveness of interventions.\nCapturing real-time localized air quality data is critical for timely responses but current systems often struggle with this. Conventional monitoring setups can lag in delivering data, impacting the ability to make informed decisions quickly. This lack of immediacy reduces the potential for proactive air quality management.\nThese challenges highlight the need for more accessible, scalable, and affordable monitoring technologies, including innovations such as low-cost sensors that expand geographic coverage and provide timely data.\nTechnological advancements in air pollution sensors are transforming environmental monitoring. Stationary low-cost sensors are now available, providing more accessible and widespread data collection than traditional methods. These sensors enable real-time monitoring, offering immediate insights into air quality conditions.\nLow-cost air quality sensors are compact and easily deployable, making them ideal for use in various settings, from urban environments to rural areas. They measure a range of pollutants, including particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone, providing comprehensive air quality data.

However, decline of aerosol emissions since 2010 should increase the 1970\u20132010 global warming rate of 0.18\u00b0C per decade to a post-2010 rate of at least 0.27\u00b0C per decade. Thus, under the present geopolitical approach to GHG emissions, global warming will exceed 1.5\u00b0C in the 2020s and 2\u00b0C before 2050. Impacts on people and nature will accelerate as global warming increases hydrologic (weather) extremes. The enormity of consequences demands a return to Holocene-level global temperature.

Current political crises present an opportunity for reset, especially if young people can grasp their situation.\nIt has been known since the 1800s that infrared-absorbing (greenhouse) gases (GHGs) warm Earth\u2019s surface and that the abundance of GHGs changes naturally as well as from human actions [1, 2].1 Roger Revelle wrote in 1965 that we are conducting a \u2018vast geophysical experiment\u2019 by burning fossil fuels that accumulated in Earth\u2019s crust over hundreds of millions of years [3] Carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air is now increasing and already has reached levels that have not existed for millions of years, with consequences that have yet to be determined. Jule Charney led a study in 1979 by the United States National Academy of Sciences that concluded that doubling of atmospheric CO2 was likely to cause global warming of 3 \u00b1 1.5\u00b0C [4]. Charney added: \u2018However, we believe it is quite possible that the capacity of the intermediate waters of the ocean to absorb heat could delay the estimated warming by several decades.\u2019\nAfter U.S. President Jimmy Carter signed the 1980 Energy Security Act, which included a focus on unconventional fossil fuels such as coal gasification and rock fracturing (\u2018fracking\u2019) to extract shale oil and tight gas, the U.S. Congress asked the National Academy of Sciences again to assess potential climate effects. Their massive Changing Climate report had a measured tone on energy policy\u2014amounting to a call for research [5]. Was not enough known to caution lawmakers against taxpayer subsidy of the most carbon-intensive fossil fuels? Perhaps the equanimity was due in part to a major error: the report assumed that the delay of global warming caused by the ocean\u2019s thermal inertia is 15 years, independent of climate sensitivity. With that assumption, they concluded that climate sensitivity for 2 \u00d7 CO2 is near or below the low end of Charney\u2019s 1.5\u20134.5\u00b0C range. If climate sensitivity was low and the lag between emissions and climate response was only 15 years, climate change would not be nearly the threat that it is.\nSimultaneous with preparation of Changing Climate, climate sensitivity was addressed at the 1982 Ewing Symposium at the Lamont Doherty Geophysical Observatory of Columbia University on 25\u201327 October, with papers published in January 1984 as a monograph of the American Geophysical Union [6]. Paleoclimate data and global climate modeling together led to an inference that climate sensitivity is in the range 2.5\u20135\u00b0C for 2 \u00d7 CO2 and that climate response time to a forcing is of the order of a century, not 15 years [7]. Thus, the concept that a large amount of additional human-made warming is already \u2018in the pipeline\u2019 was introduced. E.E. David, Jr, President of Exxon Research and Engineering, in his keynote talk at the symposium insightfully noted [8]: \u2018The critical problem is that the environmental impacts of the CO2 buildup may be so long delayed. A look at the theory of feedback systems shows that where there is such a long delay, the system breaks down, unless there is anticipation built into the loop.\u2019\nThus, the danger caused by climate\u2019s delayed response and the need for anticipatory action to alter the course of fossil fuel development was apparent to scientists and the fossil fuel industry 40 years ago.2 Yet industry chose to long deny the need to change energy course [9], and now, while governments and financial interests connive, most industry adopts a \u2018greenwash\u2019 approach that threatens to lock in perilous consequences for humanity. Scientists will share responsibility if we allow governments to rely on goals for future global GHG levels, as if targets had meaning in the absence of policies required to achieve them.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was established in 1988 to provide scientific assessments on the state of knowledge about climate change [10] and almost all nations agreed to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change [11] with the objective to avert \u2018dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system\u2019. The current IPCC Working Group 1 report [12] provides a best estimate of 3\u00b0C for equilibrium global climate sensitivity to 2 \u00d7 CO2 and describes shutdown of the overturning ocean circulations and large sea level rise on the century time scale as \u2018high impact, low probability\u2019 even under extreme GHG growth scenario\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Consistent analysis of temperature over the full Cenozoic era\u2014including \u2018slow\u2019 feedbacks by ice sheets and trace gases\u2014supports this sensitivity and implies that CO2 was 300\u2013350 ppm in the Pliocene and about 450 ppm at transition to a nearly ice-free planet, exposing unrealistic lethargy of ice sheet models. Equilibrium global warming for today\u2019s GHG amount is 10\u00b0C, which is reduced to 8\u00b0C by today\u2019s human-made aerosols. Equilibrium warming is not \u2018committed\u2019 warming; rapid phaseout of GHG emissions would prevent most equilibrium warming from occurring. However, decline of aerosol emissions since 2010 should increase the 1970\u20132010 global warming rate of 0.18\u00b0C per decade to a post-2010 rate of at least 0.27\u00b0C per decade. Thus, under the present geopolitical approach to GHG emissions, global warming will exceed 1.5\u00b0C in the 2020s and 2\u00b0C before 2050. Impacts on people and nature will accelerate as global warming increases hydrologic (weather) extremes. The enormity of consequences demands a return to Holocene-level global temperature. Required actions include: (1) a global increasing price on GHG emissions accompanied by development of abundant, affordable, dispatchable clean energy, (2) East-West cooperation in a way that accommodates developing world needs, and (3) intervention with Earth\u2019s radiation imbalance to phase down today\u2019s massive human-made \u2018geo-transformation\u2019 of Earth\u2019s climate. Current political crises present an opportunity for reset, especially if young people can grasp their situation.\nIt has been known since the 1800s that infrared-absorbing (greenhouse) gases (GHGs) warm Earth\u2019s surface and that the abundance of GHGs changes naturally as well as from human actions [1, 2].1 Roger Revelle wrote in 1965 that we are conducting a \u2018vast geophysical experiment\u2019 by burning fossil fuels that accumulated in Earth\u2019s crust over hundreds of millions of years [3] Carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air is now increasing and already has reached levels that have not existed for millions of years, with consequences that have yet to be determined. Jule Charney led a study in 1979 by the United States National Academy of Sciences that concluded that doubling of atmospheric CO2 was likely to cause global warming of 3 \u00b1 1.5\u00b0C [4]. Charney added: \u2018However, we believe it is quite possible that the capacity of the intermediate waters of the ocean to absorb heat could delay the estimated warming by several decades.\u2019\nAfter U.S. President Jimmy Carter signed the 1980 Energy Security Act, which included a focus on unconventional fossil fuels such as coal gasification and rock fracturing (\u2018fracking\u2019) to extract shale oil and tight gas, the U.S. Congress asked the National Academy of Sciences again to assess potential climate effects. Their massive Changing Climate report had a measured tone on energy policy\u2014amounting to a call for research [5]. Was not enough known to caution lawmakers against taxpayer subsidy of the most carbon-intensive fossil fuels? Perhaps the equanimity was due in part to a major error: the report assumed that the delay of global warming caused by the ocean\u2019s thermal inertia is 15 years, independent of climate sensitivity. With that assumption, they concluded that climate sensitivity for 2 \u00d7 CO2 is near or below the low end of Charney\u2019s 1.5\u20134.5\u00b0C range. If climate sensitivity was low and the lag between emissions and climate response was only 15 years, climate change would not be nearly the threat that it is.\nSimultaneous with preparation of Changing Climate, climate sensitivity was addressed at the 1982 Ewing Symposium at the Lamont Doherty Geophysical Observatory of Columbia University on 25\u201327 October, with papers published in January 1984 as a monograph of the American Geophysical Union [6]. Paleoclimate data and global climate modeling together led to an inference that climate sensitivity is in the range 2.5\u20135\u00b0C for 2 \u00d7 CO2 and that climate response time to a forcing is of the order of a century, not 15 years [7]. Thus, the concept that a large amount of additional human-made warming is already \u2018in the pipeline\u2019 was introduced. E.E. David, Jr, President of Exxon Research and Engineering, in his keynote talk at the symposium insightfully noted [8]: \u2018The critical problem is that the environmental impacts of the CO2 buildup may be so long delayed.
