    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nWhat you\u2019re about to see\u2026 is a historic moment. [TRUMP]: \u201c...we're very much working very closely with China and president Xi.\u201d [HOST]: Not that. [TRUMP]:\u201d...if you look at Idlib Province in Syria.\u201d [HOST]: Nope [TRUMP]:\u201cSo, Prime Minister Abe came here\u2026\u201d [HOST]: Not that either... But this... [TRUMP]: \u201cI'm going to be signing a national emergency. And it's been signed many times before. It's been signed by other presidents. There's rarely been a problem. They sign it; nobody cares. ..\u201d [HOST]: President Trump is right, many other presidents have used this power before. But his declaration isn\u2019t normal. At all. Why? Because by using it to fund his proposed border wall, he has made it the first time a president has used this power to pay for policy that had already been rejected by Congress. [GOITEIN]: \u201cThis this is an unprecedented abuse of power in terms of the president basically saying that Congress cannot limit him.\u201d [HOST]: That\u2019s Elizabeth Goitein from the Brennan Center for Justices. She\u2019s extensively studied presidential declarations of National Emergencies. And she\u2019ll help us better understand what\u2019s different about Trump\u2019s declaration. Let's start here, in December 2018: [TRUMP]: \u201cI am proud to shutdown the government for border security, Chuck. \u2026 I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I\u2019m not going to blame you for it.\u201d [HOST]: Trump said he would refuse to sign a budget into law unless it included $5.7 billion dollars for his proposed border wall on the U.S. / Mexico border. Democrats, who took control of the House of Representatives in January, refused to give in to the president\u2019s demand. The result\u2026 a political stalemate and the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. Eventually, on February 14th, a budget was passed\u2026 but it did not include funding for the border wall. That\u2019s when Trump decided to take executive action to fund his border wall by declaring a \u201cnational emergency.\u201d [GOITEIN]: This president is pushing a very dangerous vision of constitutional government where the president gets to do what he wants. And that's not what the Constitution provides for. This is dangerous. It's undemocratic. [HOST]: The declaration allows the president to unilaterally divert billions of dollars from military construction projects to fund this border wall. But now, Trump\u2019s declaration is being challenged in the courts and Congress. In a historic vote on February 26th, the House of Representatives voted to block a presidential national emergency for the first time ever. The legislation now moves to the Senate. [GOITEIN]: I think it's has a good chance of passing the Senate. At that point of course the president would veto it and then the chances are overriding that veto are slim to be sure. [HOST]: That\u2019s because Congress would need a supermajority vote, two-thirds of both chambers, to override a presidential veto. And since some say it\u2019s unlikely that it will be blocked by Congress, it will be left up to the courts to determine whether it\u2019s legal or not. Right now, 16 states are suing the president for what they say is an \u201cunconstitutional\u201d use of executive power. The lawsuit claims the president has used a \u201cmanufactured crisis\u201d to call for an emergency. [GOITEIN]: \u201cIn this case it's very clear from the president's words and his actions that he is declaring this emergency for the purpose of getting around Congress\u2026 That's an abuse of power. [HOST]: What Goitein is saying there\u2026 isn\u2019t really controversial. In fact, the president even made this point himself in the very same speech where he first announced his declaration. [TRUMP]: \u201cI could do the wall over a longer period of time, I didn't need to do this, but I'd rather do it much faster.\u201d [HOST]: But let\u2019s take a step back. Despite this announcement being the first of its kind, presidential declarations of national emergencies definitely aren\u2019t anything new, or out of the ordinary. For example, in addition to this most recent one, President Trump has declared three others during his time in office. President Obama? He issued 12. Bush? 13. And Clinton? 17. In addition to the recent one, there are 31 other active national emergencies, which need to be renewed every year. The oldest one still in effect is from president Jimmy Carter in 1979 -- which were sanctions in response to the Iran hostage crisis. But when did this type of power first arise? First, it\u2019s important to know that the U.S. Constitution doesn\u2019t explicitly give a president the right to declare a national emergency. But presidents have taken this type of unilateral action for some time now -- claiming it\u2019s part of the \u201cexecutive powers\u201d granted to them in the constitution. President Woodrow Wilson was the first president to declare a national emergency during World War I. Since then, numerous presidents have used this type of executive power -- sometimes in really awful ways. Take Franklin Roosevelt for example\u2026 He used it to order the internment of over 100,000 Japanese-Americans during World War II . But this type of executive power has been successfully blocked too. In the 1950s, the Supreme Court blocked President Harry Truman\u2019s attempt to nationalize the steel industry during the the Korean War. With this type of presidential overreach fresh in the minds of Congress, it took action to scale back executive power in the 1970s. [GOITEIN]: \u201cThere had been several just massive scandals involving executive branch overreach. For example Watergate, the bombing of Cambodia during Vietnam, the CIA's domestic spying programs and all of these things came to light at around the same time. And so Congress just decided to take a very hard look at executive power in general.\u201d [HOST]: It passed the National Emergencies Act of 1976. The legislation formalized a president\u2019s ability to declare national emergencies, but also aimed to give legislators the ability to check the president\u2019s power. But Goitein says since it passed, the law has failed to limit presidential powers the way it intended to. And she argues that if Trump\u2019s recent declaration is allowed to stay in effect, it would set a really dangerous precedent. [GOITEIN]: It is not by any means the scariest of the emergency powers that become available to a president when he declares a national emergency. There are powers that allow the president simply by declaring a national emergency to shut down or take over radio stations. Powers that allow him to freeze Americans bank accounts and criminalize doing business with Americans that are designated by the government. [HOST]: Those examples of potential areas of abuse by a president are why Goiten says Congress needs to act now -- not only to place limits on President Trump\u2019s power, but for those who occupy the office after him as well.",

With eight national emergencies declared already during his second term, the President is outpacing previous Administrations.\nThe National Emergencies Act of 1976 (NEA) terminated existing national emergencies and established procedures for how the Federal government responds to declared national emergencies. It limited the scope and duration of states of national emergency and formalized Congress\u2019 power to provide certain checks and balances on the emergency powers of the President. The NEA provides Congress with expedited procedures for consideration of a joint resolution terminating a national emergency, and it establishes a six-month congressional review period for ongoing national emergencies with the aim of granting Congress greater control over the use of emergency powers. Under Section 202(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. \u00a71622(c)), a joint resolution to terminate a national emergency can be introduced in either chamber at any time and referred to the appropriate committee.\nDemocratic Senator Frank Church, a critic of the Vietnam War, was furious when in 1970 President Nixon expanded the war into Cambodia without Congressional approval. Church drafted an amendment to prevent congressionally appropriated funds from being used for American war efforts in Cambodia. In response, Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird warned that the Pentagon would fund ground operations using the emergency provisions of the Feed and Forage Act, a Civil War-era law that granted the U.S. Cavalry the authority to purchase feed for its horses if appropriated money ran out while Congress was not in session. (Concerns over US military action in Cambodia and Congress\u2019 powers to declare war also led to enactment of the War Powers Resolution in 1973, overriding President Nixon\u2019s veto.)\nIn 1973, the Senate tasked a temporary committee with investigating \u201coutdated\u201d emergency powers Congress granted to Presidents in the previous half century. The Special Committee on the Termination of the National Emergency, was co-chaired by Church and Senator Charles Mathias (R-MD). The Committee identified a list of 470 powers that Congress had granted to Presidents in the previous half century during times of national crisis, and while those crises had ended, Congress had not officially revoked those powers. Further, the legislative branch had rarely limited Presidents\u2019 emergency powers. The findings of the Committee eventually led to passage of the National Emergencies Act in 1976, which President Ford signed.\nThe International Economic Emergency Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA) gives the President authority to take certain steps to restrict commerce upon the declaration of a national emergency under the NEA. It grants the President broad authorities to impose economic sanctions and regulate economic transactions during national emergencies that involve an \u201cunusual and extraordinary\u201d threats to national security, foreign policy, or the economy. IEEPA also permits the President to \u201cregulate\u201d or \u201cprohibit\u201d imports, typically used to impose sanctions or to ban most or all transactions with a country, as when Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 or when Russia launched its second invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\nAs of June 2025, Presidents have declared 90 emergencies under the NEA, with IEEPA as the most frequently cited emergency authority. According to combined data from tracking by both the Congressional Research Service (CRS) and the Brennan Center, there are currently 52 ongoing national emergencies, all but three involving IEEPA.\nAccording to data from CRS, as of January 2024, Presidents have issued approximately 4.5 Executive Orders citing IEEPA and declared 1.5 new national emergencies citing IEEPA each year since 1990. Between 1977 and January 2024, national emergencies involving IEEPA last on average nearly nine years, with the majority targeting hostile states. However, new trends have emerged since 1990. In more recent decades, Presidents have increasingly declared non-geographically specific emergencies in response to concerns such as weapons proliferation, global terrorism, and malicious cyber activity. Rather than targeting foreign governments, IEEPA has increasingly been used to target groups, such as political parties, corporations, or terrorist organizations, and individuals, such as supporters of terrorism, suspected narcotics traffickers, and associates of the International Criminal Court.\nAnother significant trend is the expansion of rationale for declaring a state of emergency. Early rationales citing IEEPA being short and referencing a geographic area, such as \u201cthe situation in Iran,\u201d in EO 12170 following the seizure of the US Embassy in Tehran in 1979, the first declared national emergency since enactment of the NEA. Stated rationales now commonly include response to human and civil rights abuses, slavery, and denial of religious freedom, among others, with the majority of those referencing human rights declared in the last two decades.\nIn the first 100 days of the President\u2019s second term, the Administration declared eight states of emergency, more than any other modern President has in the same period. These emergencies concern issues such as the southern border, energy and critical minerals, drug cartels and terrorist organizations, and the International Criminal Court, among others.\nMost notable is the President\u2019s use of IEEPA regarding trade. He used this authority under IEEPA in February to declare a national emergency with respect to fentanyl and used this authority to impose tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada (in the case of Canada, regulating the tariffs by imposing a lower tariff on Canadian energy imports). Later, on April 2, President Trump declared a national emergency with respect to large US tra\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Nearly two months after the attack, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066.\nIn an effort to curb potential Japanese espionage, Executive Order 9066 approved the relocation of Japanese-Americans into internment camps. At first, the relocations were completed on a voluntary basis. Volunteers to relocate were minimal, so the executive order paved the way for forced relocation of Japanese-Americans living on the west coast. During the six months following the issue of EO 9066, over 100,000 Japanese-Americans found themselves placed into concentration camps within the United States. These concentration camps were called \u201crelocation camps.\u201d\nJapanese-Americans were referred to by their generation within the United States. The first generation of Japanese immigrants were called Issei. The second generation of American born Japanese-Americans were called Nisei. This executive order affected over 117,000 Japanese-Americans from both generations. Thousands of people lost their homes and businesses due to \u201cfailure to pay taxes.\u201d\nEO 9066 was widely controversial. This order stayed in place until President Harry S. Truman signed Executive Order 9742 on June 25, 1946. EO 9742 ordered the liquidation of the War Relocation Authority and allowed Japanese-Americans to return to their homes. Many of the newly released Japanese-Americans returned home to find their belongings stolen or their property sold.\nJapanese-Americans who were returning home faced discrimination and prejudice from the civilian population. President Harry S. Truman, who was ashamed of these acts, paid tribute to the Japanese-American soldiers of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team.\nIn 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed the Civil Liberties Act. The remaining survivors of the relocation camps were sent formal letters of apology and were awarded $20,000 in restitutions from the United States government.\nDespite the actions taken by various presidents after the liquidation of the War Relocation Authority, many Japanese-Americans never felt closure. The American-created internment camps are rarely discussed in history. Royals bench coach Don Wakamatsu said, \u201cAny time you can talk about it, it immortalizes it a little bit more,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s always in history a learning curve.

Roosevelt signs Executive Order 9066, initiating a controversial World War II policy with lasting consequences for Japanese Americans. The document ordered the forced removal of resident \"enemy aliens\" from parts of the West vaguely identified as military areas.\nThe internment of Japanese Americans began after President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 in February 1942. For the following three years, American men, women, and children were forced to live under prison-like conditions in remote concentration camps. This 1943 film explains the internment from the U.S. government's perspective.\nAfter the bombing of Pearl Harbor by the Japanese in 1941, Roosevelt came under increasing pressure by military and political advisors to address the nation\u2019s fears of further Japanese attack or sabotage, particularly on the West Coast, where naval ports, commercial shipping and agriculture were most vulnerable. Included in the off-limits military areas referred to in the order were ill-defined areas around West Coast cities, ports and industrial and agricultural regions. While 9066 also affected Italian and German Americans, the largest numbers of detainees were by far Japanese Americans.\nOn the West Coast, long-standing racism against Japanese Americans, motivated in part by jealousy over their commercial success, erupted after Pearl Harbor into furious demands to remove them en masse to Relocation Centers for the duration of the war.\nJapanese immigrants and their descendants, regardless of American citizenship status or length of residence, were systematically rounded up and placed in prison camps. Evacuees, as they were sometimes called, could take only as many possessions as they could carry and were forcibly placed in crude, cramped quarters. In the western states, camps on remote and barren sites such as Manzanar and Tule Lake housed thousands of families whose lives were interrupted and in some cases destroyed by Executive Order 9066. Many lost businesses, farms and loved ones as a result.\nExecutive Order 9066 (Feb 1942) forced 117,000 Japanese Americans, including the Mochida family, into internment camps by June.\nAfter Pearl Harbor, a Japanese American in Oakland posted \u201cI Am An American.\u201d His shop was soon closed, and he was interned.\nAccommodations for Japanese Americans at the Santa Anita \u201creception center,\u201d Los Angeles County, California, April 1942.\nMarch 21, 1942: The first 82 Japanese Americans arrived at Owens Valley camp, which later held over 10,000 internees.\nChildren of the Weill public school are shown in a flag pledge ceremony in April 1942.

Attorney General Francis Biddle recalled Roosevelt\u2019s grim determination to do whatever he thought was necessary to win the war. Biddle observed that Roosevelt was not much concerned with the gravity or implications of issuing an order that essentially contradicted the Bill of Rights.\nIn her memoirs, Eleanor Roosevelt recalled being completely floored by her husband\u2019s action.

With support from Ruhollah Khomeini, who had led the Iranian Revolution and would eventually establish the present-day Islamic Republic of Iran, the hostage-takers demanded that the United States extradite Iranian king Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, who had been granted asylum by the Carter administration for cancer treatment. Notable among the assailants were Hossein Dehghan (future Minister of Defense of Iran), Mohammad Ali Jafari (future Commander-in-Chief of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps), and Mohammad Bagheri (future Chief of the General Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces).[4][5][6][7] The hostage crisis contributed to a dramatic decline in Iran\u2013United States relations.[8] After 444 days, it came to an end with the signing of the Algiers Accords between the Iranian and American governments; Iran's king had died in Cairo, Egypt, on July 27, 1980.\nThe American magazine Time described the Iran hostage crisis as an entanglement of vengeance and mutual incomprehension.[9] American president Jimmy Carter called the hostage-taking an act of \"blackmail\" and the hostages \"victims of terrorism and anarchy.\"[10] Among proponents of the Iranian Revolution, it was seen as an act against perceived attempts by the United States to undermine the uprising against Iran's king, who had been accused of committing numerous human rights abuses against Iranian dissidents through his Bureau for Intelligence and Security of the State.[11] The Carter administration's refusal to extradite Pahlavi was cited by the hostage-takers as proof of complicity on the part of the United States, which, in turn, denounced the Iranians' hostage-taking as an egregious violation of the principles of international law, such as the Vienna Convention, under which diplomats and diplomatic compounds are to be granted immunity from coercion and harassment.[12][13][14][15]\nSix American diplomats who had evaded capture were rescued by the \"Canadian Caper\" on January 27, 1980. As Iran hostage crisis negotiations dragged out and did not secure the release of the remaining hostages, Carter approved Operation Eagle Claw on April 24, 1980. The effort failed, however, resulting in the death of one Iranian civilian and eight American soldiers, prompting Secretary of State Cyrus Vance to resign from his position. By September 1980, the beginning of the Iraqi invasion of Iran spurred the Iranian government to negotiate with the United States as part of an initiative mediated by Algeria.\nPolitical analysts cited the standoff as a major factor in the downfall of Carter's presidency, culminating in his landslide loss in the 1980 presidential election.[16] The hostages were formally released into American custody one day after the Algiers Accords were signed, just minutes following the first inauguration of Ronald Reagan. In Iran, the crisis strengthened the prestige of Khomeini and the political power of theocrats who opposed normalization with the Western world.[17] Since then, the United States has enforced international sanctions against Iran with regard to the latter's nuclear ambitions and human rights record, further weakening ties between the two countries.[18]\nDuring the Second World War, the British and the Soviet governments invaded and occupied Iran, forcing the first Pahlavi monarch, Reza Shah Pahlavi, to abdicate in favor of his eldest son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.[19] The two nations claimed that they acted pre-emptively in order to stop Reza Shah from aligning his petroleum-rich country with Nazi Germany. However, the Shah's declaration of neutrality, and his refusal to allow Iranian territory to be used to train or supply Soviet troops, were probably the real reasons for the invasion of Iran.[20]\nThe United States did not participate in the invasion but it secured Iran's independence after the war ended by applying intense diplomatic pressure on the Soviet Union which forced it to withdraw from Iran in 1946.\nBy the 1950s, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was engaged in a power struggle with Iran's prime minister, Mohammad Mosaddegh, an immediate descendant of the preceding Qajar dynasty. Mosaddegh led a general strike, demanding an increased share of the nation's petroleum revenue from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company which was operating in Iran. The UK retaliated by reducing the amount of revenue which the Iranian government received.[21][better source needed] In 1953, the CIA and MI6 helped Iranian royalists depose Mosaddegh in a military coup d'\u00e9tat codenamed Operation Ajax, allowing the Shah to extend his power. For the next two decades the Shah reigned as an absolute monarch. \"Disloyal\" elements within the state were purged.[22][23][24] The U.S. continued to support the Shah after the coup, with the CIA training the Iranian secret police. In the subsequent decades of the Cold War, various economic, cultural, and political issues united Iranian opposition against the Shah and led to his eventual overthrow.[25][26][27]\nMonths before the Iranian Revolution, on New Year's Eve 1977, U.S. President Jimmy Carter further angered anti-Shah Iranians with a televised toast to Pahlavi at a state dinner in Tehran, saluting the Shah's character.[28] After the revolution commenced in February 1979 with the return of the Ayatollah Khomeini from exile, the American Embassy was occupied, and its staff held hostage briefly. Rocks and bullets had broken so many of the embassy's front-facing windows that they were replaced with bulletproof glass. The embassy's staff was reduced to just over 60 from a high of nearly one thousand ea\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Weicker (R-CT)\nChapter 1: Origins Chapter 2: Process Chapter 3: Public Relations Chapter 4: Investigation Chapter 5: Outcome\nOrigins Early on the morning of June 17, 1972, five men broke into the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate hotel and office complex in Washington, D.C. A security guard discovered the team and alerted the metro police, who arrested the burglars, who carried more than $3,500 in cash and high-end surveillance and electronic equipment.\nWhile the burglars awaited their arraignment in federal district court, the FBI launched an investigation of the incident. The dogged reporting of two Washington Post journalists, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, raised questions and suggested connections between Nixon\u2019s reelection campaign and the men awaiting trial in federal district court. The White House denied any connection to the break-in, and President Richard Nixon won reelection in a landslide in November 1972.\nOn January 10, 1973, the trial of the Watergate burglars and two accomplices began. After weeks of testimony, Chief Federal District Judge John Sirica expressed skepticism that all the facts in the case had been revealed. Five men pleaded guilty and two were convicted by a jury. Judge Sirica urged those awaiting sentencing to cooperate with the soon-to-be-established Senate select committee.\nProcess On February 5, 1973, Senator Edward Kennedy offered Senate Resolution 60 to establish a Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities to investigate campaign activities related to the presidential election of 1972. Traditionally the sponsoring member presides over an inquiry. Majority Leader Mike Mansfield wanted to avoid the possibility that the committee would seem unduly partisan because of Kennedy's presidential aspirations and instead offered the chair to Senator Sam Ervin of North Carolina.\nWell-qualified to head the investigation, Senator Ervin was a former North Carolina Supreme Court justice, a self-proclaimed \u201ccountry lawyer\u201d with a degree from Harvard Law School, and widely regarded as the Senate\u2019s constitutional expert. At 76 years old he did not aspire to the presidency. His reputation among his Senate colleagues was, according to Secretary of the Senate Frank Valeo, \u201cunassailable.\u201d As chairman of the Constitutional Rights Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Ervin had investigated a number of issues important to the Watergate scandal, including surveillance and wiretapping.\nOn February 7, 1973, the Senate voted unanimously to create the select committee. The resolution empowered four Democrats and three Republicans to subpoena witnesses and materials, provided them with a $500,000 budget, and required them to submit a final report by February 28, 1974. The resolution granted the committee the power to investigate the break-in and any subsequent cover-up of criminal activity, as well as \u201call other illegal, improper, or unethical conduct occurring during the Presidential campaign of 1972, including political espionage and campaign finance practices.\u201d\nPublic Relations Emphasizing the educational function of congressional investigations, the committee\u2019s chief counsel, Samuel Dash, coordinated an aggressive media strategy. The print news media focused America's attention on the issue with hard-hitting investigative reports, while television news outlets brought the drama of the hearings to the living rooms of millions of American households, broadcasting the proceedings live for two weeks in May 1973. The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) broadcast the hearings during prime time on more than 150 national affiliates, earning higher ratings than regularly scheduled entertainment programming. Only one month after the hearings began, an overwhelming majority of Americans\u201497 percent\u2014had heard of Watergate. Of those, 67 percent believed that President Nixon had participated in the Watergate cover-up.\nInvestigation The Senate Watergate Committee has been credited with reviving public confidence in congressional investigations, which had declined during the McCarthy inquiries of the 1950s. Several factors contributed to the committee\u2019s overall success including extensive media coverage, sustained public interest, the meticulous work of investigators, the cooperation of key witnesses, and the continuing support of the full Senate. Public support for the investigation remained strong even when a series of confrontations between the Watergate Committee and the White House provoked a constitutional crisis.\nThroughout the inquiry President Nixon rebuffed the committee\u2019s requests for access to information. Claiming a constitutional separation of powers, he refused to allow his aides to testify. Senator Ervin insisted that executive privilege could not be extended to cover criminal behavior and he threatened to authorize the sergeant at arms to arrest White House aides who refused to testify. Conceding to public pressure, the president allowed his aides to cooperate but continued to deny the committee access to presidential papers. Nixon repeatedly declared that he knew nothing about the Watergate burglary, but former White House counsel John Dean III testified that the president had approved plans to cover up White House connections to the break-in. Another former aide, Alexander Butterfield, revealed that the president maintained a voice-activated tape recorder system in various rooms in the White House.\nChairman Ervin requested access to the tapes, believing that they would either corroborate or repudiate testimony that the president had knowledge of, and approved efforts to cover up, the Watergate break-in. Senate Resolution 194 authorized the committee to \u201cissue subpoenas\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

With eight national emergencies declared already during his second term, the President is outpacing previous Administrations.\nThe National Emergencies Act of 1976 (NEA) terminated existing national emergencies and established procedures for how the Federal government responds to declared national emergencies. It limited the scope and duration of states of national emergency and formalized Congress\u2019 power to provide certain checks and balances on the emergency powers of the President. The NEA provides Congress with expedited procedures for consideration of a joint resolution terminating a national emergency, and it establishes a six-month congressional review period for ongoing national emergencies with the aim of granting Congress greater control over the use of emergency powers. Under Section 202(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. \u00a71622(c)), a joint resolution to terminate a national emergency can be introduced in either chamber at any time and referred to the appropriate committee.\nDemocratic Senator Frank Church, a critic of the Vietnam War, was furious when in 1970 President Nixon expanded the war into Cambodia without Congressional approval. Church drafted an amendment to prevent congressionally appropriated funds from being used for American war efforts in Cambodia. In response, Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird warned that the Pentagon would fund ground operations using the emergency provisions of the Feed and Forage Act, a Civil War-era law that granted the U.S. Cavalry the authority to purchase feed for its horses if appropriated money ran out while Congress was not in session. (Concerns over US military action in Cambodia and Congress\u2019 powers to declare war also led to enactment of the War Powers Resolution in 1973, overriding President Nixon\u2019s veto.)\nIn 1973, the Senate tasked a temporary committee with investigating \u201coutdated\u201d emergency powers Congress granted to Presidents in the previous half century. The Special Committee on the Termination of the National Emergency, was co-chaired by Church and Senator Charles Mathias (R-MD). The Committee identified a list of 470 powers that Congress had granted to Presidents in the previous half century during times of national crisis, and while those crises had ended, Congress had not officially revoked those powers. Further, the legislative branch had rarely limited Presidents\u2019 emergency powers. The findings of the Committee eventually led to passage of the National Emergencies Act in 1976, which President Ford signed.\nThe International Economic Emergency Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA) gives the President authority to take certain steps to restrict commerce upon the declaration of a national emergency under the NEA. It grants the President broad authorities to impose economic sanctions and regulate economic transactions during national emergencies that involve an \u201cunusual and extraordinary\u201d threats to national security, foreign policy, or the economy. IEEPA also permits the President to \u201cregulate\u201d or \u201cprohibit\u201d imports, typically used to impose sanctions or to ban most or all transactions with a country, as when Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 or when Russia launched its second invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\nAs of June 2025, Presidents have declared 90 emergencies under the NEA, with IEEPA as the most frequently cited emergency authority. According to combined data from tracking by both the Congressional Research Service (CRS) and the Brennan Center, there are currently 52 ongoing national emergencies, all but three involving IEEPA.\nAccording to data from CRS, as of January 2024, Presidents have issued approximately 4.5 Executive Orders citing IEEPA and declared 1.5 new national emergencies citing IEEPA each year since 1990. Between 1977 and January 2024, national emergencies involving IEEPA last on average nearly nine years, with the majority targeting hostile states. However, new trends have emerged since 1990. In more recent decades, Presidents have increasingly declared non-geographically specific emergencies in response to concerns such as weapons proliferation, global terrorism, and malicious cyber activity. Rather than targeting foreign governments, IEEPA has increasingly been used to target groups, such as political parties, corporations, or terrorist organizations, and individuals, such as supporters of terrorism, suspected narcotics traffickers, and associates of the International Criminal Court.\nAnother significant trend is the expansion of rationale for declaring a state of emergency. Early rationales citing IEEPA being short and referencing a geographic area, such as \u201cthe situation in Iran,\u201d in EO 12170 following the seizure of the US Embassy in Tehran in 1979, the first declared national emergency since enactment of the NEA. Stated rationales now commonly include response to human and civil rights abuses, slavery, and denial of religious freedom, among others, with the majority of those referencing human rights declared in the last two decades.\nIn the first 100 days of the President\u2019s second term, the Administration declared eight states of emergency, more than any other modern President has in the same period. These emergencies concern issues such as the southern border, energy and critical minerals, drug cartels and terrorist organizations, and the International Criminal Court, among others.\nMost notable is the President\u2019s use of IEEPA regarding trade. He used this authority under IEEPA in February to declare a national emergency with respect to fentanyl and used this authority to impose tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada (in the case of Canada, regulating the tariffs by imposing a lower tariff on Canadian energy imports). Later, on April 2, President Trump declared a national emergency with respect to large US tra\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Bush formally declared national emergencies on September 14 and 23 pursuant to the National Emergencies Act. The President's actions follow a long-standing tradition of alerting the nation to a crisis threatening public order and constitutional government. Currently, such declarations also allow the President to make use of activated authority on a selective basis, as appropriate for responding to an emergency. Updated as events recommend, this report chronicles the actions taken by President Bush pursuant to his national emergency declarations, as well the issuance of additional such declarations concerning terrorism.\nTerrorist attacks against the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., on September 11, 2001, prompted President George W. Bush to declare a national emergency on September 14. (1) His action followed a long-standing tradition, dating, in the federal experience, to August 17, 1794, when President George Washington issued a proclamation calling forth the militia to suppress rebellious opposition to the collection of an excise tax on whiskey in locales of western Pennsylvania, Virginia, and the Carolinas. (2) Washington took personal command of the forces organized to put down the \"Whiskey Rebellion.\"\nUntil the crisis of World War I, Presidents utilized emergency powers at their own discretion. Proclamations announced the exercise of exigency authority. However, during World War I and thereafter, Chief Executives had available to them a growing body of standby emergency authority that became operative upon the issuance of a proclamation declaring a condition of national emergency. Sometimes such proclamations confined the matter of crisis to a specific policy sphere, and sometimes they placed no limitation whatsoever on the pronouncement. These activations of standby emergency authority remained acceptable practice until the era of the Vietnam war.\nGrowing public and congressional displeasure with the President's exercise of his war powers and deepening U.S. involvement in hostilities in Vietnam prompted interest in a variety of related matters. Senator Charles Mathias, together with Senator Frank Church, sought to establish a Senate special committee to study administration reliance on a 1950 proclamation of national emergency to prosecute the Vietnam war. Initially chartered in June 1972 with Mathias and Church as cochairmen, the study panel subsequently produced various studies and assessments. (3) Among other discoveries, the committee, after reviewing the United States Code and uncodified emergency powers statutes, identified 470 provisions of federal law that delegated extraordinary authority to the executive in time of national emergency. It also found that there was no process for automatically terminating outstanding national emergency proclamations. Thus, the panel began developing legislation containing a formula for regulating emergency declarations in the future and otherwise adjusting the body of statutorily delegated emergency powers by abolishing some provisions, relegating others to permanent status, and continuing others in a standby capacity. Its final report, offering findings and recommendations, was issued in May 1976. (4)\nAs early as July 1974, the special committee had unanimously recommended legislation establishing a procedure for presidential declaration and congressional regulation of a national emergency. Introduced in the Senate the following month, the measure, after negotiation with the executive branch and further refinement, was cleared for President Gerald Ford's signature on September 14, 1976. (5)\nAs enacted, the National Emergencies Act consisted of five titles. The first of these generally returned all standby statutory delegations of emergency power, activated by an outstanding declaration of national emergency, to a dormant state two years after the statute's approval. However, the act did not cancel outstanding 1933, 1950, 1970, and 1971 national emergency proclamations, because these were issued by the President pursuant to his Article II constitutional authority. Nevertheless, it did render them ineffective by returning to dormancy the statutory authorities they had activated, thereby necessitating a new declaration to activate standby statutory emergency authorities.\nTitle II provided a procedure for future declarations of national emergency by the President and prescribed arrangements for their congressional regulation. The statute established an exclusive means for declaring a national emergency. Furthermore, emergency declarations were to terminate automatically after one year unless formally continued for another year by the President, but could be terminated earlier by either the President or Congress. Originally, the prescribed method for congressional termination of a declared national emergency was a concurrent resolution adopted by both houses of Congress. This type of so-called \"legislative veto\" was effectively invalidated by the Supre\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

With eight national emergencies declared already during his second term, the President is outpacing previous Administrations.\nThe National Emergencies Act of 1976 (NEA) terminated existing national emergencies and established procedures for how the Federal government responds to declared national emergencies. It limited the scope and duration of states of national emergency and formalized Congress\u2019 power to provide certain checks and balances on the emergency powers of the President. The NEA provides Congress with expedited procedures for consideration of a joint resolution terminating a national emergency, and it establishes a six-month congressional review period for ongoing national emergencies with the aim of granting Congress greater control over the use of emergency powers. Under Section 202(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. \u00a71622(c)), a joint resolution to terminate a national emergency can be introduced in either chamber at any time and referred to the appropriate committee.\nDemocratic Senator Frank Church, a critic of the Vietnam War, was furious when in 1970 President Nixon expanded the war into Cambodia without Congressional approval. Church drafted an amendment to prevent congressionally appropriated funds from being used for American war efforts in Cambodia. In response, Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird warned that the Pentagon would fund ground operations using the emergency provisions of the Feed and Forage Act, a Civil War-era law that granted the U.S. Cavalry the authority to purchase feed for its horses if appropriated money ran out while Congress was not in session. (Concerns over US military action in Cambodia and Congress\u2019 powers to declare war also led to enactment of the War Powers Resolution in 1973, overriding President Nixon\u2019s veto.)\nIn 1973, the Senate tasked a temporary committee with investigating \u201coutdated\u201d emergency powers Congress granted to Presidents in the previous half century. The Special Committee on the Termination of the National Emergency, was co-chaired by Church and Senator Charles Mathias (R-MD). The Committee identified a list of 470 powers that Congress had granted to Presidents in the previous half century during times of national crisis, and while those crises had ended, Congress had not officially revoked those powers. Further, the legislative branch had rarely limited Presidents\u2019 emergency powers. The findings of the Committee eventually led to passage of the National Emergencies Act in 1976, which President Ford signed.\nThe International Economic Emergency Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA) gives the President authority to take certain steps to restrict commerce upon the declaration of a national emergency under the NEA. It grants the President broad authorities to impose economic sanctions and regulate economic transactions during national emergencies that involve an \u201cunusual and extraordinary\u201d threats to national security, foreign policy, or the economy. IEEPA also permits the President to \u201cregulate\u201d or \u201cprohibit\u201d imports, typically used to impose sanctions or to ban most or all transactions with a country, as when Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 or when Russia launched its second invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\nAs of June 2025, Presidents have declared 90 emergencies under the NEA, with IEEPA as the most frequently cited emergency authority. According to combined data from tracking by both the Congressional Research Service (CRS) and the Brennan Center, there are currently 52 ongoing national emergencies, all but three involving IEEPA.\nAccording to data from CRS, as of January 2024, Presidents have issued approximately 4.5 Executive Orders citing IEEPA and declared 1.5 new national emergencies citing IEEPA each year since 1990. Between 1977 and January 2024, national emergencies involving IEEPA last on average nearly nine years, with the majority targeting hostile states. However, new trends have emerged since 1990. In more recent decades, Presidents have increasingly declared non-geographically specific emergencies in response to concerns such as weapons proliferation, global terrorism, and malicious cyber activity. Rather than targeting foreign governments, IEEPA has increasingly been used to target groups, such as political parties, corporations, or terrorist organizations, and individuals, such as supporters of terrorism, suspected narcotics traffickers, and associates of the International Criminal Court.\nAnother significant trend is the expansion of rationale for declaring a state of emergency. Early rationales citing IEEPA being short and referencing a geographic area, such as \u201cthe situation in Iran,\u201d in EO 12170 following the seizure of the US Embassy in Tehran in 1979, the first declared national emergency since enactment of the NEA. Stated rationales now commonly include response to human and civil rights abuses, slavery, and denial of religious freedom, among others, with the majority of those referencing human rights declared in the last two decades.\nIn the first 100 days of the President\u2019s second term, the Administration declared eight states of emergency, more than any other modern President has in the same period. These emergencies concern issues such as the southern border, energy and critical minerals, drug cartels and terrorist organizations, and the International Criminal Court, among others.\nMost notable is the President\u2019s use of IEEPA regarding trade. He used this authority under IEEPA in February to declare a national emergency with respect to fentanyl and used this authority to impose tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada (in the case of Canada, regulating the tariffs by imposing a lower tariff on Canadian energy imports).

With support from Ruhollah Khomeini, who had led the Iranian Revolution and would eventually establish the present-day Islamic Republic of Iran, the hostage-takers demanded that the United States extradite Iranian king Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, who had been granted asylum by the Carter administration for cancer treatment. Notable among the assailants were Hossein Dehghan (future Minister of Defense of Iran), Mohammad Ali Jafari (future Commander-in-Chief of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps), and Mohammad Bagheri (future Chief of the General Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces).[4][5][6][7] The hostage crisis contributed to a dramatic decline in Iran\u2013United States relations.[8] After 444 days, it came to an end with the signing of the Algiers Accords between the Iranian and American governments; Iran's king had died in Cairo, Egypt, on July 27, 1980.\nThe American magazine Time described the Iran hostage crisis as an entanglement of vengeance and mutual incomprehension.[9] American president Jimmy Carter called the hostage-taking an act of \"blackmail\" and the hostages \"victims of terrorism and anarchy.\"[10] Among proponents of the Iranian Revolution, it was seen as an act against perceived attempts by the United States to undermine the uprising against Iran's king, who had been accused of committing numerous human rights abuses against Iranian dissidents through his Bureau for Intelligence and Security of the State.[11] The Carter administration's refusal to extradite Pahlavi was cited by the hostage-takers as proof of complicity on the part of the United States, which, in turn, denounced the Iranians' hostage-taking as an egregious violation of the principles of international law, such as the Vienna Convention, under which diplomats and diplomatic compounds are to be granted immunity from coercion and harassment.[12][13][14][15]\nSix American diplomats who had evaded capture were rescued by the \"Canadian Caper\" on January 27, 1980. As Iran hostage crisis negotiations dragged out and did not secure the release of the remaining hostages, Carter approved Operation Eagle Claw on April 24, 1980. The effort failed, however, resulting in the death of one Iranian civilian and eight American soldiers, prompting Secretary of State Cyrus Vance to resign from his position. By September 1980, the beginning of the Iraqi invasion of Iran spurred the Iranian government to negotiate with the United States as part of an initiative mediated by Algeria.\nPolitical analysts cited the standoff as a major factor in the downfall of Carter's presidency, culminating in his landslide loss in the 1980 presidential election.[16] The hostages were formally released into American custody one day after the Algiers Accords were signed, just minutes following the first inauguration of Ronald Reagan. In Iran, the crisis strengthened the prestige of Khomeini and the political power of theocrats who opposed normalization with the Western world.[17] Since then, the United States has enforced international sanctions against Iran with regard to the latter's nuclear ambitions and human rights record, further weakening ties between the two countries.[18]\nDuring the Second World War, the British and the Soviet governments invaded and occupied Iran, forcing the first Pahlavi monarch, Reza Shah Pahlavi, to abdicate in favor of his eldest son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.[19] The two nations claimed that they acted pre-emptively in order to stop Reza Shah from aligning his petroleum-rich country with Nazi Germany. However, the Shah's declaration of neutrality, and his refusal to allow Iranian territory to be used to train or supply Soviet troops, were probably the real reasons for the invasion of Iran.[20]\nThe United States did not participate in the invasion but it secured Iran's independence after the war ended by applying intense diplomatic pressure on the Soviet Union which forced it to withdraw from Iran in 1946.\nBy the 1950s, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was engaged in a power struggle with Iran's prime minister, Mohammad Mosaddegh, an immediate descendant of the preceding Qajar dynasty. Mosaddegh led a general strike, demanding an increased share of the nation's petroleum revenue from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company which was operating in Iran. The UK retaliated by reducing the amount of revenue which the Iranian government received.[21][better source needed] In 1953, the CIA and MI6 helped Iranian royalists depose Mosaddegh in a military coup d'\u00e9tat codenamed Operation Ajax, allowing the Shah to extend his power. For the next two decades the Shah reigned as an absolute monarch. \"Disloyal\" elements within the state were purged.[22][23][24] The U.S. continued to support the Shah after the coup, with the CIA training the Iranian secret police. In the subsequent decades of the Cold War, various economic, cultural, and political issues united Iranian opposition against the Shah and led to his eventual overthrow.[25][26][27]\nMonths before the Iranian Revolution, on New Year's Eve 1977, U.S. President Jimmy Carter further angered anti-Shah Iranians with a televised toast to Pahlavi at a state dinner in Tehran, saluting the Shah's character.[28] After the revolution commenced in February 1979 with the return of the Ayatollah Khomeini from exile, the American Embassy was occupied, and its staff held hostage briefly. Rocks and bullets had broken so many of the embassy's front-facing windows that they were replaced with bulletproof glass. The embassy's staff was reduced to just over 60 from a high of nearly one thousand ea\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

On April 2, 1917, President Woodrow Wilson addressed Congress, seeking a declaration of war against Germany, which was formally granted on April 6. Prior to this, the U.S. had maintained a stance of neutrality despite its financial and material support for the Entente Allies. However, escalating German submarine warfare and the interception of a proposed alliance between Germany and Mexico heightened tensions, prompting a reevaluation of U.S. involvement.\nSeveral factors contributed to this shift, including the threat posed by unrestricted submarine attacks on neutral ships, the belief that U.S. security was at risk, and a growing public sentiment favoring intervention. Wilson's vision of an idealistic peace, alongside the grave human cost of continued conflict, led him to conclude that U.S. involvement was essential for achieving a favorable outcome. His decision was met with both support and criticism, particularly in light of the post-war challenges that followed. Ultimately, U.S. participation aimed to bring about a swift Allied victory and reshape the international order, although the aftermath raised questions about the effectiveness of Wilson's aspirations for peace.\nDate April 6, 1917\nU.S. involvement transformed the Great War into a global conflict with worldwide ramifications.\nLocale Washington, D.C.\nOn April 2, 1917, Woodrow Wilson, president of the United States, stood before the combined members of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate and asked for a declaration of war against Germany. \u201cIt is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war,\u201d he concluded.\u201cBut the right is more precious than peace.\u201d Four days later, on April 6, the United States was formally at war.\nFor two and a half years following the outbreak of the war in Europe in August, 1914, the United States had practiced a policy of neutrality. The U.S. government had lent money and supplies to the Entente Allies (Great Britain and France) but also had attempted to avoid antagonizing the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire). Neutral U.S. ships carried arms and munitions to the Allies, and Germany, seeing its war effort threatened, attempted to restrict this trade by sinking U.S. ships, primarily through the use of submarine warfare. In 1914, 1915, and 1916, Germany announced increases in the kinds of neutral ships that would be subject to submarine attack, only to moderate its demands in the face of strong U.S. threats to break off diplomatic relations. During these years, Wilson made several sincere efforts to mediate the European dispute, but his attempts failed.\nIn early 1917, the German government determined to take a calculated risk. Effective February 1, Germany announced, a policy of unrestricted submarine warfare would begin, and any neutral ship, armed or not, that attempted to transport supplies to the British or French would be attacked. Two days later, Wilson\u2019s administration broke off diplomatic relations with Germany. Addressing a joint session of Congress on February 3, the president explained that it was the only alternative \u201cconsistent with the dignity and honor of the U.S.\u201d However, he stated, he was not heading toward war, which would come only if Germany indulged in overt acts against the United States.\nThese acts came in the form of an escalated German submarine campaign in which many U.S. and Allied vessels were sunk and massive numbers of lives were lost. Wilson\u2019s response was to call for armed neutrality, but the subsequent interception by the British of an encoded message from German foreign secretary Alfred Zimmermann to Mexico\u2019s German minister proposing an alliance should war break out (known as the Zimmermann note) raised the threat of Mexican involvement and brought the war closer to home. On April 2, 1917, Wilson made it clear before a joint session of Congress that armed neutrality was an insufficient response to German attacks, and on April 6, the United States formally declared war on Germany.\nWhy Wilson went on to ask for a declaration of war two months after breaking off diplomatic relations with Germany has been the subject of intense historical debate. Six major arguments have been advanced: (1) U.S. bankers and arms manufacturers forced Wilson to declare war because the Allies would not be able to repay their debts if they lost the war; (2) clever British propaganda tricked Americans into believing that moral wrong resided exclusively in Germany; (3) U.S. security would be endangered by a German victory, because Germany was bent on worldwide aggression; (4) public opinion in the United States demanded war; (5) German submarine warfare forced the United States into the war; and (6) by April, 1917, Wilson believed that peace without victory in Europe demanded that U.S. forces be sent overseas, so Wilson personally decided that a declaration of war was necessary.\nThe first four of these arguments have their enthusiastic proponents but lack persuasive evidence. By the end of the twentieth century, most historians tended to emphasize the final two arguments. German submarine policy determined the course of U.S. neutrality after 1914; Germany\u2019s decision to begin unrestricted warfare in February, 1917, was a major reason for U.S. entrance into the war. Not to be discounted also was Wilson\u2019s personal belief that he could bring about an idealistic peace in Europe only by helping the Allies defeat the Central Powers.\nThere can be no doubt of Wilson\u2019s sincerity in believing that the United States must undertake a moral crusade by fighting a war \u201cto end all wars.\u201d In spite of his genuine unwillingness, Wilson opted for war largely through calculations of cost and benefit. His policy of armed neutrality had turned out to be a failure in terms of the loss of lives and property it had entailed and the enemies it had creat\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

These \"fast track\" procedures are intended to limit consideration and allow a simple majority to reach a final vote in each chamber by setting deadlines for action on the measure at each stage of its consideration. However, the NEA is silent on most other aspects of consideration, unlike many more recent statutory procedures that typically include more specific instructions. Some insight regarding the possible operation of the procedures provided in the statute may be found in precedents established in relation to the War Powers Resolution of 1973 (WPR), after which the NEA's procedures were patterned.\nThis statutory rule presents a number of procedural ambiguities. The text of the NEA does not provide guidance on how the deadlines established by the act are to be calculated. Furthermore, there is no precise text stipulated by the NEA, although every termination resolution submitted to date has been drafted in the same form. Furthermore, the text of the statutory rule suggests that any such measure is fully amendable in the House and Senate, including by nongermane amendment. If the Senate were to apply a 2018 WPR precedent to the NEA, then any amendments to a termination resolution would have to be germane. The House's standing rules require amendments to be germane.\nThe NEA establishes a six-month review period for ongoing national emergencies. The text of the act suggests that Congress would vote within every six-month period that a national emergency remains active. However, in practice, the House and Senate appear to have interpreted this language to mean that a termination resolution can be considered every six months under expedited procedures, if such legislation is introduced, but that Congress is not required to vote every six months on national emergencies.\nUpon introduction and referral of a termination resolution, the NEA directs committees to report the measure within 15 calendar days. A privileged motion to discharge becomes available in the House if a committee has not reported within this period of time. In the Senate, the committee of referral is automatically discharged after the expiration of the 15-calendar-day consideration period.\nOnce a committee has reported or been discharged, the termination resolution is to become the pending business of the chamber, which must vote on passage within three calendar days thereafter, unless the chamber votes otherwise. In the House, consideration is likely to be structured by a special rule reported by the Committee on Rules and adopted by the House. Absent that, a privileged motion to take up the measure likely becomes available in the House. In the Senate, a motion to proceed to consideration may not be necessary, as the act states that any measure reported \"shall become the pending business.\" The Senate interpreted an identical three-day deadline under the WPR to mean that a vote on passage will occur 72 hours after the measure has been reported and could choose to apply the same interpretation to the NEA.\nIn the event the text of each chamber's termination resolution is different, the NEA calls for the prompt appointment of conferees. The conference committee is directed to report back to each respective chamber within six calendar days. The House and Senate, in turn, are also directed to vote on the resulting conference report not later than six calendar days after the report is first filed.\nTo date, 16 termination resolutions have been submitted to Congress, all of which have been considered under alternative parliamentary mechanisms.

Bush formally declared national emergencies on September 14 and 23 pursuant to the National Emergencies Act. The President's actions follow a long-standing tradition of alerting the nation to a crisis threatening public order and constitutional government. Currently, such declarations also allow the President to make use of activated authority on a selective basis, as appropriate for responding to an emergency. Updated as events recommend, this report chronicles the actions taken by President Bush pursuant to his national emergency declarations, as well the issuance of additional such declarations concerning terrorism.\nTerrorist attacks against the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., on September 11, 2001, prompted President George W. Bush to declare a national emergency on September 14. (1) His action followed a long-standing tradition, dating, in the federal experience, to August 17, 1794, when President George Washington issued a proclamation calling forth the militia to suppress rebellious opposition to the collection of an excise tax on whiskey in locales of western Pennsylvania, Virginia, and the Carolinas. (2) Washington took personal command of the forces organized to put down the \"Whiskey Rebellion.\"\nUntil the crisis of World War I, Presidents utilized emergency powers at their own discretion. Proclamations announced the exercise of exigency authority. However, during World War I and thereafter, Chief Executives had available to them a growing body of standby emergency authority that became operative upon the issuance of a proclamation declaring a condition of national emergency. Sometimes such proclamations confined the matter of crisis to a specific policy sphere, and sometimes they placed no limitation whatsoever on the pronouncement. These activations of standby emergency authority remained acceptable practice until the era of the Vietnam war.\nGrowing public and congressional displeasure with the President's exercise of his war powers and deepening U.S. involvement in hostilities in Vietnam prompted interest in a variety of related matters. Senator Charles Mathias, together with Senator Frank Church, sought to establish a Senate special committee to study administration reliance on a 1950 proclamation of national emergency to prosecute the Vietnam war. Initially chartered in June 1972 with Mathias and Church as cochairmen, the study panel subsequently produced various studies and assessments. (3) Among other discoveries, the committee, after reviewing the United States Code and uncodified emergency powers statutes, identified 470 provisions of federal law that delegated extraordinary authority to the executive in time of national emergency. It also found that there was no process for automatically terminating outstanding national emergency proclamations. Thus, the panel began developing legislation containing a formula for regulating emergency declarations in the future and otherwise adjusting the body of statutorily delegated emergency powers by abolishing some provisions, relegating others to permanent status, and continuing others in a standby capacity. Its final report, offering findings and recommendations, was issued in May 1976. (4)\nAs early as July 1974, the special committee had unanimously recommended legislation establishing a procedure for presidential declaration and congressional regulation of a national emergency. Introduced in the Senate the following month, the measure, after negotiation with the executive branch and further refinement, was cleared for President Gerald Ford's signature on September 14, 1976. (5)\nAs enacted, the National Emergencies Act consisted of five titles. The first of these generally returned all standby statutory delegations of emergency power, activated by an outstanding declaration of national emergency, to a dormant state two years after the statute's approval. However, the act did not cancel outstanding 1933, 1950, 1970, and 1971 national emergency proclamations, because these were issued by the President pursuant to his Article II constitutional authority. Nevertheless, it did render them ineffective by returning to dormancy the statutory authorities they had activated, thereby necessitating a new declaration to activate standby statutory emergency authorities.\nTitle II provided a procedure for future declarations of national emergency by the President and prescribed arrangements for their congressional regulation. The statute established an exclusive means for declaring a national emergency. Furthermore, emergency declarations were to terminate automatically after one year unless formally continued for another year by the President, but could be terminated earlier by either the President or Congress. Originally, the prescribed method for congressional termination of a declared national emergency was a concurrent resolution adopted by both houses of Congress.

A security guard discovered the team and alerted the metro police, who arrested the burglars, who carried more than $3,500 in cash and high-end surveillance and electronic equipment.\nWhile the burglars awaited their arraignment in federal district court, the FBI launched an investigation of the incident. The dogged reporting of two Washington Post journalists, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, raised questions and suggested connections between Nixon\u2019s reelection campaign and the men awaiting trial in federal district court. The White House denied any connection to the break-in, and President Richard Nixon won reelection in a landslide in November 1972.\nOn January 10, 1973, the trial of the Watergate burglars and two accomplices began. After weeks of testimony, Chief Federal District Judge John Sirica expressed skepticism that all the facts in the case had been revealed. Five men pleaded guilty and two were convicted by a jury. Judge Sirica urged those awaiting sentencing to cooperate with the soon-to-be-established Senate select committee.\nProcess On February 5, 1973, Senator Edward Kennedy offered Senate Resolution 60 to establish a Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities to investigate campaign activities related to the presidential election of 1972. Traditionally the sponsoring member presides over an inquiry. Majority Leader Mike Mansfield wanted to avoid the possibility that the committee would seem unduly partisan because of Kennedy's presidential aspirations and instead offered the chair to Senator Sam Ervin of North Carolina.\nWell-qualified to head the investigation, Senator Ervin was a former North Carolina Supreme Court justice, a self-proclaimed \u201ccountry lawyer\u201d with a degree from Harvard Law School, and widely regarded as the Senate\u2019s constitutional expert. At 76 years old he did not aspire to the presidency. His reputation among his Senate colleagues was, according to Secretary of the Senate Frank Valeo, \u201cunassailable.\u201d As chairman of the Constitutional Rights Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Ervin had investigated a number of issues important to the Watergate scandal, including surveillance and wiretapping.\nOn February 7, 1973, the Senate voted unanimously to create the select committee. The resolution empowered four Democrats and three Republicans to subpoena witnesses and materials, provided them with a $500,000 budget, and required them to submit a final report by February 28, 1974. The resolution granted the committee the power to investigate the break-in and any subsequent cover-up of criminal activity, as well as \u201call other illegal, improper, or unethical conduct occurring during the Presidential campaign of 1972, including political espionage and campaign finance practices.\u201d\nPublic Relations Emphasizing the educational function of congressional investigations, the committee\u2019s chief counsel, Samuel Dash, coordinated an aggressive media strategy. The print news media focused America's attention on the issue with hard-hitting investigative reports, while television news outlets brought the drama of the hearings to the living rooms of millions of American households, broadcasting the proceedings live for two weeks in May 1973. The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) broadcast the hearings during prime time on more than 150 national affiliates, earning higher ratings than regularly scheduled entertainment programming. Only one month after the hearings began, an overwhelming majority of Americans\u201497 percent\u2014had heard of Watergate. Of those, 67 percent believed that President Nixon had participated in the Watergate cover-up.\nInvestigation The Senate Watergate Committee has been credited with reviving public confidence in congressional investigations, which had declined during the McCarthy inquiries of the 1950s. Several factors contributed to the committee\u2019s overall success including extensive media coverage, sustained public interest, the meticulous work of investigators, the cooperation of key witnesses, and the continuing support of the full Senate. Public support for the investigation remained strong even when a series of confrontations between the Watergate Committee and the White House provoked a constitutional crisis.\nThroughout the inquiry President Nixon rebuffed the committee\u2019s requests for access to information. Claiming a constitutional separation of powers, he refused to allow his aides to testify. Senator Ervin insisted that executive privilege could not be extended to cover criminal behavior and he threatened to authorize the sergeant at arms to arrest White House aides who refused to testify. Conceding to public pressure, the president allowed his aides to cooperate but continued to deny the committee access to presidential papers. Nixon repeatedly declared that he knew nothing about the Watergate burglary, but former White House counsel John Dean III testified that the president had approved plans to cover up White House connections to the break-in. Another former aide, Alexander Butterfield, revealed that the president maintained a voice-activated tape recorder system in various rooms in the White House.\nChairman Ervin requested access to the tapes, believing that they would either corroborate or repudiate testimony that the president had knowledge of, and approved efforts to cover up, the Watergate break-in. Senate Resolution 194 authorized the committee to \u201cissue subpoenas\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

In 1973 the Senate approved a resolution establishing the Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities to investigate various aspects of the 1972 presidential campaign including the break in of the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate Office Building.1 The Senate Committee engaged in a series of hearings and received testimony from a number of President Richard Nixon\u2019s closest advisers.2 These hearings uncovered the existence of a taping mechanism installed in the White House, which led to a major confrontation between the President, Congress, and the courts over appropriate access to confidential presidential communications.3 The Senate investigation, in conjunction with an investigation spearheaded by the Watergate Special Prosecutor eventually led to an impeachment investigation in the House and, ultimately, President Nixon\u2019s resignation from office.4\nThe Watergate investigation was followed up by the 1975 House and Senate investigations into potential abuses by the U.S. intelligence community. The Senate Select Committee to Study Government Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities (known as the Church Committee after its Chairman, Senator Frank Church)5 and the House Select Intelligence Committee (known as the Pike Committee after its chairman, Congressman Otis Pike)6 held both private and public hearings inquiring into a variety of secret programs, including some related to the potential assassination of foreign leaders, run by the Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, and Federal Bureau of Investigation. The Committees\u2019 work had a significant influence on the Executive Branch, ultimately resulting in President Gerald Ford taking actions to reform and reorganize the Intelligence Community.\nThe Watergate, Church, and Pike investigations not only uncovered Executive Branch abuses, but also helped Congress inform itself for legislative enactments to correct problems that had been uncovered by the Committees. The experience of the Watergate investigation, for example, arguably led to campaign finance reform and the Ethics in Government Act, while the findings of the Church and Pike Committees led to enactment of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.7 Congress also made internal changes to increase legislative oversight of intelligence activities by establishing select committees on intelligence in both the House and Senate.8\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Nearly two months after the attack, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066.\nIn an effort to curb potential Japanese espionage, Executive Order 9066 approved the relocation of Japanese-Americans into internment camps. At first, the relocations were completed on a voluntary basis. Volunteers to relocate were minimal, so the executive order paved the way for forced relocation of Japanese-Americans living on the west coast. During the six months following the issue of EO 9066, over 100,000 Japanese-Americans found themselves placed into concentration camps within the United States. These concentration camps were called \u201crelocation camps.\u201d\nJapanese-Americans were referred to by their generation within the United States. The first generation of Japanese immigrants were called Issei. The second generation of American born Japanese-Americans were called Nisei. This executive order affected over 117,000 Japanese-Americans from both generations. Thousands of people lost their homes and businesses due to \u201cfailure to pay taxes.\u201d\nEO 9066 was widely controversial. This order stayed in place until President Harry S. Truman signed Executive Order 9742 on June 25, 1946. EO 9742 ordered the liquidation of the War Relocation Authority and allowed Japanese-Americans to return to their homes. Many of the newly released Japanese-Americans returned home to find their belongings stolen or their property sold.\nJapanese-Americans who were returning home faced discrimination and prejudice from the civilian population. President Harry S. Truman, who was ashamed of these acts, paid tribute to the Japanese-American soldiers of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team.\nIn 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed the Civil Liberties Act. The remaining survivors of the relocation camps were sent formal letters of apology and were awarded $20,000 in restitutions from the United States government.\nDespite the actions taken by various presidents after the liquidation of the War Relocation Authority, many Japanese-Americans never felt closure. The American-created internment camps are rarely discussed in history.

Not later than six months after a national emergency is declared, and not later than the end of ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nIn 1973 the Senate assigned a herculean task to a small temporary committee. The Special Committee on the Termination of the National Emergency (renamed the Special Committee on National Emergencies and Delegated Emergency Powers in 1974), co-chaired by Democrat Frank Church of Idaho and Republican Charles Mathias of Maryland, would investigate outdated emergency powers granted to presidents by Congress in the previous half century. The inquiry\u2019s surprising findings convinced Congress to pass the National Emergencies Act of 1976.\nThe story of this obscure Senate committee begins with the Vietnam War. In 1968 Republican presidential candidate Richard Nixon pledged to end the war if elected. In the spring of 1970, however, President Nixon secretly expanded the war into Cambodia\u2014without congressional approval. Weeks later, Nixon announced the expansion of the war into Cambodia on national television. The administration\u2019s actions infuriated many senators, especially Frank Church, a long-time Vietnam War critic. Church drafted a proposal\u2014later known as the Cooper-Church amendment\u2014to prevent congressionally appropriated funds from being used in Cambodia. Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird quickly rendered this effort moot. If Congress halted funding for the Cambodia effort, Laird warned, the Pentagon would fund the operation under the emergency provisions of a Civil War-era law called the Feed and Forage Act. With that law, Congress had granted the U.S. Cavalry the authority to purchase feed for its horses if previously appropriated money had run out while Congress was not in session. Laird explained that the provision had been used in 1958 in Lebanon and in 1961 in Berlin to fund U.S. military actions.1\nThe administration\u2019s ability to circumvent Congress under the authority of a century-old law troubled Church. He had developed a reputation among his colleagues as a checks and balances proselytizer, routinely sermonizing that growing executive power threatened the health of constitutional government. When Nixon\u2019s predecessor, Democrat Lyndon Johnson, occupied the White House, Democratic majorities in Congress felt little urgency to limit the powers of a president of their own party, and Church\u2019s homilies fell on deaf ears, but the Nixon administration\u2019s invasion of Cambodia converted some of Church\u2019s colleagues to his cause. One of them, Republican Charles \u201cMac\u201d Mathias of Maryland, insisted that Congress had a role to play in holding every president accountable\u2014regardless of party. On January 6, 1973, the Senate created the Special Committee on the Termination of the National Emergency. Church and Mathias would lead the inquiry, joined by six colleagues and a small committee staff.\nIdentifying the powers that Congress had conferred on presidents during times of emergency proved to be a complex task. In the pre-personal computer era, searching hundreds of printed government publications for delegated emergency powers was extraordinarily time-consuming. After months of digging, committee staff learned that the U.S. Air Force maintained a searchable list of statutes on a computer in Colorado. Using that database and other published paper sources, investigators painstakingly compiled a list of 470 powers that Congress had granted to presidents in the previous 50 years during times of crisis, such as depression or war. \u201cTaken together, these hundreds of statutes clothe the president with virtually unlimited power with which he can affect the lives of American citizens in a host of all-encompassing ways,\u201d Church wrote, including seizing property and commodities, instituting martial law, and controlling transportation and communication. Though these crises had ended, Congress had not officially cancelled or revoked the powers it had granted to administrations to address them. As the Nixon administration had demonstrated, presidents could exercise these powers without congressional approval. Four national emergencies remained in effect\u2014including one on the books since 1933! \u201cIt may be news to most Americans,\u201d explained one Washington Post reporter, that \u201cwe have been living for at least 40 years under a state of emergency rule.\u201d2\nThe committee\u2019s investigation found that the legislative branch had rarely limited presidents\u2019 emergency powers. The judicial branch, by contrast, had occasionally constrained those powers. For example, the Supreme Court firmly rebuffed President Harry Truman during the Korean War. The president had issued an executive order to seize control of some steel mills in 1952. Truman insisted that, as commander in chief, he had the authority to take action to avoid steel production slowdowns likely to be caused by an anticipated labor strike. The Court\u2019s landmark decision in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Company v. Sawyer found that no law provided for the president to seize control of private property. Associate Justice Robert Jackson wrote that presidents enjoyed maximum power when they worked under the express or implied authority of Congress, but presidents who took steps explicitly at odds with the wishes of Congress worked \u201cat [the] lowest ebb\u201d of their constitutional power.3\nThe committee\u2019s exhaustive research as well as several high-profile congressional investigations, including the Senate Watergate inquiry of 1973\u201374, convinced many in Congress that the time had come to reassert congressional checks and balances. The House introduced the National Emergencies Act in 1975 and the Senate passed a slightly amended version of that bill by voice vote in August 1976. The House agreed to the Senate\u2019s amended bill, and President Gerald Ford signed the National Emergencies Act into law on September 14, 1976. The new law ended four existing states of emergency and instituted accountability and reporting requirements for future emergencies.4\nNotes\n1.

More than 2,000 Americans died in the attack, and a united Congress answered President Roosevelt\u2019s request for war.\nRoosevelt issued Presidential Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942, after fears generated by the Japanese attack made the safety of America\u2019s West Coast a priority. He directed the military to isolate any citizen, if needed, from a 60-mile-wide coastal area from Washington state to California and extending inland into southern Arizona.\nThe executive order didn\u2019t specify Japanese-Americans as a group, but the U.S. military detained more than 100,000 people in the next six months and moved them to camps and facilities with armed guards and barbed wire.\nThere were 10 camps set up nationally, and about 120,000 people were interned in the camps during the war. About two-thirds of them were Japanese-Americans who were born in the United States. People of Italian and German heritage were also detained.\nThe controversial moves were met with legal challenges, which eventually were unsuccessful in freeing the detainees from the camps, despite the serious constitutional issues involved.\nUnder another provision, called Exclusion Order No. 34, a Japanese-American citizen named Fred Toyosaburo Korematsu was arrested for going into hiding in Northern California after refusing to go to an internment camp. Korematsu appealed his conviction through the legal system, and the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case in late 1944. The court had heard a similar case in 1943, Hirabayashi v. United States, and decided that Gordon Hirabayashi, a college student, was guilty of violating a curfew order.\nThe Korematsu v. United States decision referenced the Hirabayashi case, but it also ruled on the ability of the military, in times of war, to exclude and intern minority groups. The Court ruled in a 6 to 3 vote that the government had the power to arrest and intern Fred Korematsu. Justice Hugo Black, writing for the majority, included a paragraph that is still debated today:\n\u201cIt should be noted, to begin with, that all legal restrictions which curtail the civil rights of a single racial group are immediately suspect. That is not to say that all such restrictions are unconstitutional. It is to say that courts must subject them to the most rigid scrutiny. Pressing public necessity may sometimes justify the existence of such restrictions; racial antagonism never can,\u201d Black said.\nLater in the decision, Black explained the necessity of the military\u2019s decision. \u201cKorematsu was not excluded from the Military Area because of hostility to him or his race. He was excluded because we are at war with the Japanese Empire because the properly constituted military authorities feared an invasion of our West Coast and felt constrained to take proper security measures, because they decided that the military urgency of the situation demanded that all citizens of Japanese ancestry be segregated from the West Coast temporarily,\u201d he said.\nThe three dissenting Justices said Korematsu\u2019s constitutional rights had been clearly violated. \u201cI dissent, because I think the indisputable facts exhibit a clear violation of Constitutional rights,\u201d said Justice Owen Roberts.\n\u201cSuch exclusion goes over \u2018the very brink of constitutional power,\u2019 and falls into the ugly abyss of racism,\u201d said Justice Frank Murphy. \u201cThe broad provisions of the Bill of Rights\u2026 are [not] suspended by the mere existence of a state of war. Distinctions based on color and ancestry are utterly inconsistent with our traditions and ideals.\u201d\nJustice Robert Jackson\u2019s dissent highlighted both the racism that Murphy mentioned and that while military orders were not normally subject to judicial review, \u201cA military order, however unconstitutional, is not apt to last longer than the military emergency. Even during that period, a succeeding commander may revoke it all. But once a judicial opinion rationalizes such an order to show that it conforms to the Constitution, or rather rationalizes the Constitution to show that the Constitution sanctions such an order, the Court for all time has validated the principle of racial discrimination in criminal procedure and of transplanting American citizens.\u201d\nOn the same day, the Court said in another decision, Ex Parte Endo, that the government couldn\u2019t detain an \u201cadmittedly loyal citizen\u201d indefinitely. The decision paved the way for Japanese-Americans to return to the West Coast, but it also didn\u2019t contravene the Korematsu decision.\nIn subsequent years, the American internment policy has been met with harsh criticism. In 1988, Congress awarded restitution payments of $20,000 to each survivor of the 10 camps.\nAs part of the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, Congress apologized \u201con behalf of the people of the United States for the evacuation, relocation, and internment of such citizens and permanent resident aliens.\u201d In 1983, federal courts had also overturned the original convictions of Hirabayashi and Korematsu. Also, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Trump v. Hawaii (2018) effectively ended the Korematsu ruling\u2019s legitimacy as precedent.\nUnpacking the oral arguments in Trump v.

A security guard discovered the team and alerted the metro police, who arrested the burglars, who carried more than $3,500 in cash and high-end surveillance and electronic equipment.\nWhile the burglars awaited their arraignment in federal district court, the FBI launched an investigation of the incident. The dogged reporting of two Washington Post journalists, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, raised questions and suggested connections between Nixon\u2019s reelection campaign and the men awaiting trial in federal district court. The White House denied any connection to the break-in, and President Richard Nixon won reelection in a landslide in November 1972.\nOn January 10, 1973, the trial of the Watergate burglars and two accomplices began. After weeks of testimony, Chief Federal District Judge John Sirica expressed skepticism that all the facts in the case had been revealed. Five men pleaded guilty and two were convicted by a jury. Judge Sirica urged those awaiting sentencing to cooperate with the soon-to-be-established Senate select committee.\nProcess On February 5, 1973, Senator Edward Kennedy offered Senate Resolution 60 to establish a Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities to investigate campaign activities related to the presidential election of 1972. Traditionally the sponsoring member presides over an inquiry. Majority Leader Mike Mansfield wanted to avoid the possibility that the committee would seem unduly partisan because of Kennedy's presidential aspirations and instead offered the chair to Senator Sam Ervin of North Carolina.\nWell-qualified to head the investigation, Senator Ervin was a former North Carolina Supreme Court justice, a self-proclaimed \u201ccountry lawyer\u201d with a degree from Harvard Law School, and widely regarded as the Senate\u2019s constitutional expert. At 76 years old he did not aspire to the presidency.

Prior to ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nThe entry of the United States into World War I marked a significant turning point in the conflict and U.S. foreign policy. On April 2, 1917, President Woodrow Wilson addressed Congress, seeking a declaration of war against Germany, which was formally granted on April 6. Prior to this, the U.S. had maintained a stance of neutrality despite its financial and material support for the Entente Allies. However, escalating German submarine warfare and the interception of a proposed alliance between Germany and Mexico heightened tensions, prompting a reevaluation of U.S. involvement.\nSeveral factors contributed to this shift, including the threat posed by unrestricted submarine attacks on neutral ships, the belief that U.S. security was at risk, and a growing public sentiment favoring intervention. Wilson's vision of an idealistic peace, alongside the grave human cost of continued conflict, led him to conclude that U.S. involvement was essential for achieving a favorable outcome. His decision was met with both support and criticism, particularly in light of the post-war challenges that followed. Ultimately, U.S. participation aimed to bring about a swift Allied victory and reshape the international order, although the aftermath raised questions about the effectiveness of Wilson's aspirations for peace.\nDate April 6, 1917\nU.S. involvement transformed the Great War into a global conflict with worldwide ramifications.\nLocale Washington, D.C.\nOn April 2, 1917, Woodrow Wilson, president of the United States, stood before the combined members of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate and asked for a declaration of war against Germany. \u201cIt is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war,\u201d he concluded.\u201cBut the right is more precious than peace.\u201d Four days later, on April 6, the United States was formally at war.\nFor two and a half years following the outbreak of the war in Europe in August, 1914, the United States had practiced a policy of neutrality. The U.S. government had lent money and supplies to the Entente Allies (Great Britain and France) but also had attempted to avoid antagonizing the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire). Neutral U.S. ships carried arms and munitions to the Allies, and Germany, seeing its war effort threatened, attempted to restrict this trade by sinking U.S. ships, primarily through the use of submarine warfare. In 1914, 1915, and 1916, Germany announced increases in the kinds of neutral ships that would be subject to submarine attack, only to moderate its demands in the face of strong U.S. threats to break off diplomatic relations. During these years, Wilson made several sincere efforts to mediate the European dispute, but his attempts failed.\nIn early 1917, the German government determined to take a calculated risk. Effective February 1, Germany announced, a policy of unrestricted submarine warfare would begin, and any neutral ship, armed or not, that attempted to transport supplies to the British or French would be attacked. Two days later, Wilson\u2019s administration broke off diplomatic relations with Germany. Addressing a joint session of Congress on February 3, the president explained that it was the only alternative \u201cconsistent with the dignity and honor of the U.S.\u201d However, he stated, he was not heading toward war, which would come only if Germany indulged in overt acts against the United States.\nThese acts came in the form of an escalated German submarine campaign in which many U.S. and Allied vessels were sunk and massive numbers of lives were lost. Wilson\u2019s response was to call for armed neutrality, but the subsequent interception by the British of an encoded message from German foreign secretary Alfred Zimmermann to Mexico\u2019s German minister proposing an alliance should war break out (known as the Zimmermann note) raised the threat of Mexican involvement and brought the war closer to home. On April 2, 1917, Wilson made it clear before a joint session of Congress that armed neutrality was an insufficient response to German attacks, and on April 6, the United States formally declared war on Germany.\nWhy Wilson went on to ask for a declaration of war two months after breaking off diplomatic relations with Germany has been the subject of intense historical debate. Six major arguments have been advanced: (1) U.S. bankers and arms manufacturers forced Wilson to declare war because the Allies would not be able to repay their debts if they lost the war; (2) clever British propaganda tricked Americans into believing that moral wrong resided exclusively in Germany; (3) U.S. security would be endangered by a German victory, because Germany was bent on worldwide aggression; (4) public opinion in the United States demanded war; (5) German submarine warfare forced the United States into the war; and (6) by April, 1917, Wilson believed that peace without victory in Europe demanded that U.S. forces be sent overseas, so Wilson personally decided that a declaration of war was necessary.\nThe first four of these arguments have their enthusiastic proponents but lack persuasive evidence. By the end of the twentieth century, most historians tended to emphasize the final two arguments. German submarine policy determined the course of U.S. neutrality after 1914; Germany\u2019s decision to begin unrestricted warfare in February, 1917, was a major reason for U.S. entrance into the war. Not to be discounted also was Wilson\u2019s personal belief that he could bring about an idealistic peace in Europe only by helping the Allies defeat the Central Powers.\nThere can be no doubt of Wilson\u2019s sincerity in believing that the United States must undertake a moral crusade by fighting a war \u201cto end all wars.\u201d In spite of his genuine unwillingness, Wilson opted for war largely through calculations of cost and benefit.

On April 2, 1917, President Woodrow Wilson addressed Congress, seeking a declaration of war against Germany, which was formally granted on April 6. Prior to this, the U.S. had maintained a stance of neutrality despite its financial and material support for the Entente Allies. However, escalating German submarine warfare and the interception of a proposed alliance between Germany and Mexico heightened tensions, prompting a reevaluation of U.S. involvement.\nSeveral factors contributed to this shift, including the threat posed by unrestricted submarine attacks on neutral ships, the belief that U.S. security was at risk, and a growing public sentiment favoring intervention. Wilson's vision of an idealistic peace, alongside the grave human cost of continued conflict, led him to conclude that U.S. involvement was essential for achieving a favorable outcome. His decision was met with both support and criticism, particularly in light of the post-war challenges that followed. Ultimately, U.S. participation aimed to bring about a swift Allied victory and reshape the international order, although the aftermath raised questions about the effectiveness of Wilson's aspirations for peace.\nDate April 6, 1917\nU.S. involvement transformed the Great War into a global conflict with worldwide ramifications.\nLocale Washington, D.C.\nOn April 2, 1917, Woodrow Wilson, president of the United States, stood before the combined members of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate and asked for a declaration of war against Germany. \u201cIt is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war,\u201d he concluded.\u201cBut the right is more precious than peace.\u201d Four days later, on April 6, the United States was formally at war.\nFor two and a half years following the outbreak of the war in Europe in August, 1914, the United States had practiced a policy of neutrality. The U.S. government had lent money and supplies to the Entente Allies (Great Britain and France) but also had attempted to avoid antagonizing the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire). Neutral U.S. ships carried arms and munitions to the Allies, and Germany, seeing its war effort threatened, attempted to restrict this trade by sinking U.S. ships, primarily through the use of submarine warfare. In 1914, 1915, and 1916, Germany announced increases in the kinds of neutral ships that would be subject to submarine attack, only to moderate its demands in the face of strong U.S. threats to break off diplomatic relations. During these years, Wilson made several sincere efforts to mediate the European dispute, but his attempts failed.\nIn early 1917, the German government determined to take a calculated risk. Effective February 1, Germany announced, a policy of unrestricted submarine warfare would begin, and any neutral ship, armed or not, that attempted to transport supplies to the British or French would be attacked. Two days later, Wilson\u2019s administration broke off diplomatic relations with Germany. Addressing a joint session of Congress on February 3, the president explained that it was the only alternative \u201cconsistent with the dignity and honor of the U.S.\u201d However, he stated, he was not heading toward war, which would come only if Germany indulged in overt acts against the United States.\nThese acts came in the form of an escalated German submarine campaign in which many U.S. and Allied vessels were sunk and massive numbers of lives were lost. Wilson\u2019s response was to call for armed neutrality, but the subsequent interception by the British of an encoded message from German foreign secretary Alfred Zimmermann to Mexico\u2019s German minister proposing an alliance should war break out (known as the Zimmermann note) raised the threat of Mexican involvement and brought the war closer to home. On April 2, 1917, Wilson made it clear before a joint session of Congress that armed neutrality was an insufficient response to German attacks, and on April 6, the United States formally declared war on Germany.\nWhy Wilson went on to ask for a declaration of war two months after breaking off diplomatic relations with Germany has been the subject of intense historical debate. Six major arguments have been advanced: (1) U.S. bankers and arms manufacturers forced Wilson to declare war because the Allies would not be able to repay their debts if they lost the war; (2) clever British propaganda tricked Americans into believing that moral wrong resided exclusively in Germany; (3) U.S. security would be endangered by a German victory, because Germany was bent on worldwide aggression; (4) public opinion in the United States demanded war; (5) German submarine warfare forced the United States into the war; and (6) by April, 1917, Wilson believed that peace without victory in Europe demanded that U.S. forces be sent overseas, so Wilson personally decided that a declaration of war was necessary.\nThe first four of these arguments have their enthusiastic proponents but lack persuasive evidence. By the end of the twentieth century, most historians tended to emphasize the final two arguments. German submarine policy determined the course of U.S. neutrality after 1914; Germany\u2019s decision to begin unrestricted warfare in February, 1917, was a major reason for U.S. entrance into the war. Not to be discounted also was Wilson\u2019s personal belief that he could bring about an idealistic peace in Europe only by helping the Allies defeat the Central Powers.\nThere can be no doubt of Wilson\u2019s sincerity in believing that the United States must undertake a moral crusade by fighting a war \u201cto end all wars.\u201d In spite of his genuine unwillingness, Wilson opted for war largely through calculations of cost and benefit. His policy of armed neutrality had turned out to be a failure in terms of the loss of lives and property it had entailed and the enemies it had creat\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Weicker (R-CT)\nChapter 1: Origins Chapter 2: Process Chapter 3: Public Relations Chapter 4: Investigation Chapter 5: Outcome\nOrigins Early on the morning of June 17, 1972, five men broke into the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate hotel and office complex in Washington, D.C. A security guard discovered the team and alerted the metro police, who arrested the burglars, who carried more than $3,500 in cash and high-end surveillance and electronic equipment.\nWhile the burglars awaited their arraignment in federal district court, the FBI launched an investigation of the incident. The dogged reporting of two Washington Post journalists, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, raised questions and suggested connections between Nixon\u2019s reelection campaign and the men awaiting trial in federal district court. The White House denied any connection to the break-in, and President Richard Nixon won reelection in a landslide in November 1972.\nOn January 10, 1973, the trial of the Watergate burglars and two accomplices began. After weeks of testimony, Chief Federal District Judge John Sirica expressed skepticism that all the facts in the case had been revealed. Five men pleaded guilty and two were convicted by a jury. Judge Sirica urged those awaiting sentencing to cooperate with the soon-to-be-established Senate select committee.\nProcess On February 5, 1973, Senator Edward Kennedy offered Senate Resolution 60 to establish a Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities to investigate campaign activities related to the presidential election of 1972. Traditionally the sponsoring member presides over an inquiry. Majority Leader Mike Mansfield wanted to avoid the possibility that the committee would seem unduly partisan because of Kennedy's presidential aspirations and instead offered the chair to Senator Sam Ervin of North Carolina.\nWell-qualified to head the investigation, Senator Ervin was a former North Carolina Supreme Court justice, a self-proclaimed \u201ccountry lawyer\u201d with a degree from Harvard Law School, and widely regarded as the Senate\u2019s constitutional expert. At 76 years old he did not aspire to the presidency. His reputation among his Senate colleagues was, according to Secretary of the Senate Frank Valeo, \u201cunassailable.\u201d As chairman of the Constitutional Rights Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Ervin had investigated a number of issues important to the Watergate scandal, including surveillance and wiretapping.\nOn February 7, 1973, the Senate voted unanimously to create the select committee. The resolution empowered four Democrats and three Republicans to subpoena witnesses and materials, provided them with a $500,000 budget, and required them to submit a final report by February 28, 1974. The resolution granted the committee the power to investigate the break-in and any subsequent cover-up of criminal activity, as well as \u201call other illegal, improper, or unethical conduct occurring during the Presidential campaign of 1972, including political espionage and campaign finance practices.\u201d\nPublic Relations Emphasizing the educational function of congressional investigations, the committee\u2019s chief counsel, Samuel Dash, coordinated an aggressive media strategy. The print news media focused America's attention on the issue with hard-hitting investigative reports, while television news outlets brought the drama of the hearings to the living rooms of millions of American households, broadcasting the proceedings live for two weeks in May 1973. The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) broadcast the hearings during prime time on more than 150 national affiliates, earning higher ratings than regularly scheduled entertainment programming. Only one month after the hearings began, an overwhelming majority of Americans\u201497 percent\u2014had heard of Watergate. Of those, 67 percent believed that President Nixon had participated in the Watergate cover-up.\nInvestigation The Senate Watergate Committee has been credited with reviving public confidence in congressional investigations, which had declined during the McCarthy inquiries of the 1950s. Several factors contributed to the committee\u2019s overall success including extensive media coverage, sustained public interest, the meticulous work of investigators, the cooperation of key witnesses, and the continuing support of the full Senate. Public support for the investigation remained strong even when a series of confrontations between the Watergate Committee and the White House provoked a constitutional crisis.\nThroughout the inquiry President Nixon rebuffed the committee\u2019s requests for access to information. Claiming a constitutional separation of powers, he refused to allow his aides to testify. Senator Ervin insisted that executive privilege could not be extended to cover criminal behavior and he threatened to authorize the sergeant at arms to arrest White House aides who refused to testify. Conceding to public pressure, the president allowed his aides to cooperate but continued to deny the committee access to presidential papers. Nixon repeatedly declared that he knew nothing about the Watergate burglary, but former White House counsel John Dean III testified that the president had approved plans to cover up White House connections to the break-in. Another former aide, Alexander Butterfield, revealed that the president maintained a voice-activated tape recorder system in various rooms in the White House.\nChairman Ervin requested access to the tapes, believing that they would either corroborate or repudiate testimony that the president had knowledge of, and approved efforts to cover up, the Watergate break-in. Senate Resolution 194 authorized the committee to \u201cissue subpoenas\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Evacuees, as they were sometimes called, could take only as many possessions as they could carry and were forcibly placed in crude, cramped quarters.

Roosevelt signs Executive Order 9066, initiating a controversial World War II policy with lasting consequences for Japanese Americans. The document ordered the forced removal of resident \"enemy aliens\" from parts of the West vaguely identified as military areas.\nThe internment of Japanese Americans began after President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 in February 1942. For the following three years, American men, women, and children were forced to live under prison-like conditions in remote concentration camps. This 1943 film explains the internment from the U.S. government's perspective.\nAfter the bombing of Pearl Harbor by the Japanese in 1941, Roosevelt came under increasing pressure by military and political advisors to address the nation\u2019s fears of further Japanese attack or sabotage, particularly on the West Coast, where naval ports, commercial shipping and agriculture were most vulnerable. Included in the off-limits military areas referred to in the order were ill-defined areas around West Coast cities, ports and industrial and agricultural regions. While 9066 also affected Italian and German Americans, the largest numbers of detainees were by far Japanese Americans.\nOn the West Coast, long-standing racism against Japanese Americans, motivated in part by jealousy over their commercial success, erupted after Pearl Harbor into furious demands to remove them en masse to Relocation Centers for the duration of the war.\nJapanese immigrants and their descendants, regardless of American citizenship status or length of residence, were systematically rounded up and placed in prison camps. Evacuees, as they were sometimes called, could take only as many possessions as they could carry and were forcibly placed in crude, cramped quarters. In the western states, camps on remote and barren sites such as Manzanar and Tule Lake housed thousands of families whose lives were interrupted and in some cases destroyed by Executive Order 9066. Many lost businesses, farms and loved ones as a result.\nExecutive Order 9066 (Feb 1942) forced 117,000 Japanese Americans, including the Mochida family, into internment camps by June.\nAfter Pearl Harbor, a Japanese American in Oakland posted \u201cI Am An American.\u201d His shop was soon closed, and he was interned.\nAccommodations for Japanese Americans at the Santa Anita \u201creception center,\u201d Los Angeles County, California, April 1942.\nMarch 21, 1942: The first 82 Japanese Americans arrived at Owens Valley camp, which later held over 10,000 internees.\nChildren of the Weill public school are shown in a flag pledge ceremony in April 1942.

Attorney General Francis Biddle recalled Roosevelt\u2019s grim determination to do whatever he thought was necessary to win the war. Biddle observed that Roosevelt was not much concerned with the gravity or implications of issuing an order that essentially contradicted the Bill of Rights.\nIn her memoirs, Eleanor Roosevelt recalled being completely floored by her husband\u2019s action. A fierce proponent of civil rights, Eleanor hoped to change Roosevelt\u2019s mind, but when she brought the subject up with him, he interrupted her and told her never to mention it again.\nDuring the war, the U.S. Supreme Court heard two cases challenging the constitutionality of Executive Order 9066, upholding it both times. Finally, on February 19, 1976, decades after the war, Gerald Ford signed an order prohibiting the executive branch from re-instituting the notorious and tragic World War II order. In 1988, President Ronald Reagan issued a public apology on behalf of the government and authorized reparations for former Japanese American internees or their descendants.\nDiscover more of the major events, famous births, notable deaths and everything else history-making that happened on February 19th\nOn February 19, 1473, Nicolaus Copernicus is born in Torun, a city in north-central Poland on the Vistula River.

The Iranians held the American diplomats hostage for 444 days. While the courage of the American hostages in Tehran and of their families at home reflected the best tradition of the Department of State, the Iran hostage crisis undermined Carter\u2019s conduct of foreign policy.
