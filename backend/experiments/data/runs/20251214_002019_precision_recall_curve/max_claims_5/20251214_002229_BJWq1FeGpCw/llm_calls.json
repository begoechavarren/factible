    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nWhat if I told you that someone had developed an energy source that could help us solve our biggest environmental challenges, purify our water and air, make our cities and homes more sanitary, and keep us safe from potential catastrophic climate change? What if I also told you that this energy source was cheap, plentiful, and reliable? Well, there is such a source. You probably know it as fossil fuel. Oil. Natural gas. Coal. But wait? Don\u2019t fossil fuels pollute our environment and make our climate unlivable? That, of course, is what we\u2019re told\u2026and what our children are taught. But let\u2019s look at the data. Here\u2019s a graph you\u2019ve probably never seen: the correlation between use of fossil fuels and access to clean water. More fossil fuel. More clean water. Am I saying the more we that we have used fossil fuel, the cleaner our water has become? Yes, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying. In the developed world, we take clean water for granted. We turn on a tap and it\u2019s there. But getting it there takes a massive amount of energy. Think of the man-made reservoirs, the purification plants, the network of pipes. In the undeveloped world, it\u2019s a much different story. They lack the energy, so they lack clean water. More fossil fuel. More clean water. The same is true of sanitation. By the use of cheap, plentiful, and reliable energy from fossil fuels, we have made our environment cleaner. Take a look at this graph. More fossil fuel. Better sanitation. Okay, what about air quality? Here\u2019s a graph of the air pollution trends in the United States over the last half century based on data from the Environmental Protection Agency. Note the dramatic downward trend in emissions, even though we use more fossil fuel than ever. How was this achieved? Above all, by using anti-pollution technology powered by\u2026 fossil fuel: oil, natural gas and coal. But even without modern pollution control technology, fossil fuel makes our air cleaner. Indoor pollution\u2014caused by burning a fire inside your house, cabin, hut or tent to cook and keep warm\u2014was a deadly global problem until the late 19th century when cheap kerosene, a fossil fuel byproduct, became available in America and Europe. Indoor pollution is still a major issue in the developing world today. The best solution? Fossil fuel. And now we come to the biggest fossil fuel concern of all\u2014global warming. On this very sensitive topic we need to get our terms straight: There is a big difference between mild global warming and catastrophic global warming. We can all agree on that, right? The issue isn\u2019t: does burning fossil fuel have some warming impact? It does. The issue is: is the climate warming dangerously fast? In 1986 NASA climate scientist James Hansen\u2014one of the world\u2019s most prominent critics of the use of fossil fuels\u2014predicted that \u201cif current trends are unchanged,\u201d temperatures would rise 2 to 4 degrees in the first decade of the 2000s. But as you can see from this graph, since 2000 the trend line is essentially flat\u2014little or no warming in the last 15 years. That\u2019s probably why we hear much less talk about \u201cglobal warming\u201d and much more talk about \u201cclimate change.\u201d Has this \u201cclimate change\u201d made our world more dangerous? The key statistic here, one that is, unfortunately, almost never mentioned, is \u201cclimate-related deaths,\u201d that is, how many people die each year from a climate-related cause, including droughts, floods, storms, and extreme temperatures. In the last eighty years, as CO2 emissions have rapidly escalated, the annual rate of climate-related deaths worldwide has rapidly declined -- by 98%. The reason is that the energy from fossil fuel has allowed the developed world to build a durable civilization, one highly resilient to extreme heat, extreme cold, floods, storms, and so on. The developing world\u2014where natural disasters can still wreak terrible havoc\u2014 would like the chance to do the same. But to do that they will need a lot more energy. The cheapest, fastest and easiest way to get that energy is from fossil fuels. In sum, fossil fuels don\u2019t take a naturally safe environment and make it dangerous; they empower us to take a naturally dangerous environment and make it cleaner and safer.

Only 3% of Earth\u2019s water is freshwater, and only 0.5% of all water is accessible and safe for human consumption. Freshwater is critical for survival. On average, a human being can live without water for only three days. Increasing drought and water shortages are reducing water availability. Meanwhile, data center developers are increasingly tapping into surface and underground aquifers to cool their facilities.\nData center water usage closely parallels energy usage and carbon emissions. As data centers use more energy for their typical data center operations and to meet AI requests, they consume larger amounts of water to cool their processor chips, so as to avoid overheating and potential damage. Similarly, as energy use increases in data centers, so do carbon emissions.\nA medium-sized data center can consume up to roughly 110 million gallons of water per year for cooling purposes, equivalent to the annual water usage of approximately 1,000 households. Larger data centers can each \u201cdrink\u201d up to 5 million gallons per day, or about 1.8 billion annually, usage equivalent to a town of 10,000 to 50,000 people. Together, the nation\u2019s 5,426 data centers consume billions of gallons of water annually. One report estimated that U.S. data centers consume 449 million gallons of water per day and 163.7 billion gallons annually (as of 2021). A 2016 report found that fewer than one-third of data center operators track water consumption. Water consumption is expected to continue increasing as data centers grow in number, size, and complexity.\nAccording to scientists at the University of California, Riverside, each 100-word AI prompt is estimated to use roughly one bottle of water (or 519 milliliters). This may not sound like much, but billions of AI users worldwide enter prompts into systems like ChatGPT every minute. Large language models require many energy-intensive calculations, necessitating liquid cooling systems.\nThe Water Cycle of Data Centers\nA data center\u2019s water footprint is calculated as the sum of three categories: on-site water usage, water use by power plant facilities that supply power to data centers, and water consumption during the manufacturing process of processor chips. Water can come from various sources, including blue sources (e.g., surface water and groundwater), piped sources such as municipal water, and gray sources (e.g., purified reclaimed water). Using recycled or non-potable water to meet a data center\u2019s cooling needs is a well-established practice to conserve limited potable water resources, particularly in dry or drought-prone areas.\nIn the context of data centers, \u201cwater consumption\u201d refers to the amount of water withdrawn from blue or gray sources minus the water discharged by the centers (primarily warm water left over from cooling the IT racks). The consumed water is generally the water that evaporates or is otherwise taken out of immediate human usage. Withdrawal of fresh water from local streams or underground aquifers may lead to aquifer exhaustion, particularly in water-stressed areas.\nResearchers at The Green Grid, a nonprofit industry consortium, developed a metric called Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE) to measure water usage by data centers. Similar to the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) metric, which measures the energy efficiency of a data center, the WUE metric assesses the efficiency of a data center\u2019s water use. WUE is reported in liters per kilowatt-hour (kWh): a data center\u2019s total water consumption, measured in liters, is divided by the total energy consumed by that data center in kilowatt-hours in the same time period. While \u201c0\u201d is the ideal WUE score, this can only be achieved in air-cooled data centers, and most data centers cannot meet this target due to their location\u2019s climate conditions. The average WUE across data centers is 1.9 liters per kWh, which is a great goal to beat.\nData centers' water usage depends on various factors, including location, climate, water availability, size, and IT rack chip densities. In hotter climates, like in the southwest United States, data centers need to use more water to cool the building and equipment. With the increasing number of centers supporting AI requests, chip density is also growing, which leads to higher room temperatures, necessitating the use of more water chillers at the server level to maintain cool temperatures. Most data centers use a combination of chillers and on-site cooling towers to avoid chip overheating.\nCooling data centers is a complex operation. At the server level, water chillers cool IT rooms to maintain optimal temperatures and prevent damage to chips. This can be achieved through air cooling using water evaporation, which is an open-loop and more water-intensive method, or through server liquid cooling. Server cooling is a more expensive approach that delivers the liquid coolant directly to the graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs). Direct-to-chip liquid cooling and immersive liquid cooling are two standard server liquid cooling technologies that dissipate heat while significantly reducing water consumption. During immersive cooling, water or specialized synthetic liquids flood the chips, absorbing the heat. The difference between direct server liquid cooling and air cooling through evaporation can be compared to the difference between drip irrigation and flooding in agriculture.\nIn areas with limited water availability, server liquid cooling is the best choice, as it requires minimal water consumption. Conversely, in areas with a strained power grid, an evaporative air cooling tower is a suitable building design, as it requires minimal power usage.\nRegardless of the approach chosen, a heat exchanger is necessary to capture the hot air or hot water produced as a byproduct of the cooling process.

Freshwater is critical for ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nJune 25, 2025\nHighlights:\nAI/Data Center Resources\nData centers have a thirst for water, and their rapid expansion threatens freshwater supplies. Only 3% of Earth\u2019s water is freshwater, and only 0.5% of all water is accessible and safe for human consumption. Freshwater is critical for survival. On average, a human being can live without water for only three days. Increasing drought and water shortages are reducing water availability. Meanwhile, data center developers are increasingly tapping into surface and underground aquifers to cool their facilities.\nData center water usage closely parallels energy usage and carbon emissions. As data centers use more energy for their typical data center operations and to meet AI requests, they consume larger amounts of water to cool their processor chips, so as to avoid overheating and potential damage. Similarly, as energy use increases in data centers, so do carbon emissions.\nA medium-sized data center can consume up to roughly 110 million gallons of water per year for cooling purposes, equivalent to the annual water usage of approximately 1,000 households. Larger data centers can each \u201cdrink\u201d up to 5 million gallons per day, or about 1.8 billion annually, usage equivalent to a town of 10,000 to 50,000 people. Together, the nation\u2019s 5,426 data centers consume billions of gallons of water annually. One report estimated that U.S. data centers consume 449 million gallons of water per day and 163.7 billion gallons annually (as of 2021). A 2016 report found that fewer than one-third of data center operators track water consumption. Water consumption is expected to continue increasing as data centers grow in number, size, and complexity.\nAccording to scientists at the University of California, Riverside, each 100-word AI prompt is estimated to use roughly one bottle of water (or 519 milliliters). This may not sound like much, but billions of AI users worldwide enter prompts into systems like ChatGPT every minute. Large language models require many energy-intensive calculations, necessitating liquid cooling systems.\nThe Water Cycle of Data Centers\nA data center\u2019s water footprint is calculated as the sum of three categories: on-site water usage, water use by power plant facilities that supply power to data centers, and water consumption during the manufacturing process of processor chips. Water can come from various sources, including blue sources (e.g., surface water and groundwater), piped sources such as municipal water, and gray sources (e.g., purified reclaimed water). Using recycled or non-potable water to meet a data center\u2019s cooling needs is a well-established practice to conserve limited potable water resources, particularly in dry or drought-prone areas.\nIn the context of data centers, \u201cwater consumption\u201d refers to the amount of water withdrawn from blue or gray sources minus the water discharged by the centers (primarily warm water left over from cooling the IT racks). The consumed water is generally the water that evaporates or is otherwise taken out of immediate human usage. Withdrawal of fresh water from local streams or underground aquifers may lead to aquifer exhaustion, particularly in water-stressed areas.\nResearchers at The Green Grid, a nonprofit industry consortium, developed a metric called Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE) to measure water usage by data centers. Similar to the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) metric, which measures the energy efficiency of a data center, the WUE metric assesses the efficiency of a data center\u2019s water use. WUE is reported in liters per kilowatt-hour (kWh): a data center\u2019s total water consumption, measured in liters, is divided by the total energy consumed by that data center in kilowatt-hours in the same time period. While \u201c0\u201d is the ideal WUE score, this can only be achieved in air-cooled data centers, and most data centers cannot meet this target due to their location\u2019s climate conditions.

Similar reductions in air pollution have been observed in other regions of the world.\nThese recent improvements in air quality have come at a high cost, as communities grapple with widespread lockdowns and shelter-in-place orders as a result of the spread of COVID-19. One air pollutant, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), is primarily emitted from burning fossil fuels (diesel, gasoline, coal), coming out of our tailpipes when driving cars and smokestacks when generating electricity. Therefore, changes in NO2 levels can be used as an indicator of changes in human activity. However, care must be taken when processing and interpreting satellite NO2 data as the quantity observed by the satellite is not exactly the same as the NO2 abundance at ground level. NO2 levels are influenced by dynamical and chemical processes in the atmosphere. For instance, atmospheric NO2 levels can vary day-to-day due to changes in the weather, which influences both the lifetime of NO2 molecules as well as the dispersal of the molecules by the wind. It is also important to note that satellites that observe NO2 cannot see through clouds, so all data shown is for days with low amounts of cloudiness. If processed and interpreted carefully, NO2 levels observed from space serve as an effective proxy for NO2 levels at Earth's surface. NASA's air quality group is also monitoring other air pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide (SO2). Major anthropogenic activities that emit SO2 include electricity generation, oil and gas extraction, and metal smelting. SO2 is emitted during electricity generation if the coal burned has sulfur impurities that are not removed (or not \u201cscrubbed\u201d) from the plant\u2019s exhaust stacks.

Similar reductions in air pollution have been observed in other regions of the world.\nThese recent improvements in air quality have come at a high cost, as communities grapple with widespread lockdowns and shelter-in-place orders as a result of the spread of COVID-19. One air pollutant, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), is primarily emitted from burning fossil fuels (diesel, gasoline, coal), coming out of our tailpipes when driving cars and smokestacks when generating electricity. Therefore, changes in NO2 levels can be used as an indicator of changes in human activity. However, care must be taken when processing and interpreting satellite NO2 data as the quantity observed by the satellite is not exactly the same as the NO2 abundance at ground level. NO2 levels are influenced by dynamical and chemical processes in the atmosphere. For instance, atmospheric NO2 levels can vary day-to-day due to changes in the weather, which influences both the lifetime of NO2 molecules as well as the dispersal of the molecules by the wind. It is also important to note that satellites that observe NO2 cannot see through clouds, so all data shown is for days with low amounts of cloudiness. If processed and interpreted carefully, NO2 levels observed from space serve as an effective proxy for NO2 levels at Earth's surface. NASA's air quality group is also monitoring other air pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide (SO2). Major anthropogenic activities that emit SO2 include electricity generation, oil and gas extraction, and metal smelting. SO2 is emitted during electricity generation if the coal burned has sulfur impurities that are not removed (or not \u201cscrubbed\u201d) from the plant\u2019s exhaust stacks.

Learn more here on how water is an input for energy, and here how water is an input for the food sector.\nA key consideration for water is not just the quantity available but also whether the quality of the water is suitable for its intended purpose. Extreme climate conditions, such as drought or flooding, and human activity, such as fracking or agricultural pesticide use, all impact the quality of water available for use.

Drinking water and wastewater plants represent some of the largest energy consumption for local governments, accounting for 30%\u201340% of total energy consumed (\u201cState and Local Climate Energy Program,\u201d U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, State and Local Climate Energy Program). According to the International Energy Agency\u2019s World Energy Outlook 2016 (p. 379), the water sector\u2019s share of global electricity consumption is projected to be around 4% by 2040, which is roughly equal to the total energy consumption of Australia. However, in regions highly reliant on desalination, such as the Middle East, the electricity share is projected to increase from 9% in 2015 to 16% by 2040. Globally, of the electricity consumed for water, approximately 40% is used to extract ground and surface water, 25% is used for wastewater treatment and 20% is used for water distribution (World Energy Outlook 2016, p.347).\nEnergy use for water topics identify key considerations pertaining to the use of energy as an input to the water and wastewater sectors, including energy use for pumping, treatment, distribution, and conveyance of water and wastewater; water and wastewater system optimization and energy recovery; water quality, effluent quality, fit-for-purpose water, water efficiency, access to clean and reliable water supplies, urbanization, access to hygiene and sanitation, water system loss, energy efficiency, and demand response.\nFood for water topics identify key considerations pertaining to food or land as it influences the water and wastewater sectors.

Clean water supports healthy ecosystems, which provide important goods and services for human consumption and enjoyment. Water is also essential to meet modern needs\u2014to generate the energy required to heat and cool homes, process transportation fuels, manufacture and transport the goods we consume and support communication networks. With the threats of climate change and a growing global population, the demand for clean and reliable water supplies is on the rise. As water is essential for people, ecosystems, and industries, this valuable resource is central to the energy-water-food nexus.\nThis section describes how energy and food/land are inputs to water. Learn more here on how water is an input for energy, and here how water is an input for the food sector.\nA key consideration for water is not just the quantity available but also whether the quality of the water is suitable for its intended purpose. Extreme climate conditions, such as drought or flooding, and human activity, such as fracking or agricultural pesticide use, all impact the quality of water available for use. As water quality deteriorates, there is a greater need for highly energy intensive treatment technologies, such as desalination of drinking water and ultraviolet disinfection of wastewater to make the water suitable for people and receiving waters. Drinking water and wastewater plants represent some of the largest energy consumption for local governments, accounting for 30%\u201340% of total energy consumed (\u201cState and Local Climate Energy Program,\u201d U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, State and Local Climate Energy Program). According to the International Energy Agency\u2019s World Energy Outlook 2016 (p. 379), the water sector\u2019s share of global electricity consumption is projected to be around 4% by 2040, which is roughly equal to the total energy consumption of Australia. However, in regions highly reliant on desalination, such as the Middle East, the electricity share is projected to increase from 9% in 2015 to 16% by 2040. Globally, of the electricity consumed for water, approximately 40% is used to extract ground and surface water, 25% is used for wastewater treatment and 20% is used for water distribution (World Energy Outlook 2016, p.347).\nEnergy use for water topics identify key considerations pertaining to the use of energy as an input to the water and wastewater sectors, including energy use for pumping, treatment, distribution, and conveyance of water and wastewater; water and wastewater system optimization and energy recovery; water quality, effluent quality, fit-for-purpose water, water efficiency, access to clean and reliable water supplies, urbanization, access to hygiene and sanitation, water system loss, energy efficiency, and demand response.\nFood for water topics identify key considerations pertaining to food or land as it influences the water and wastewater sectors. Land-use decisions pertaining to development density, plant and material selection, areas impervious to water infiltration, and irrigation practices, all affect the flow and resulting quality of runoff water, impacting surrounding ecosystems and receiving waters. \u201cDeclining water quality has become a global issue of concern as human populations grow, industrial and agricultural activities expand, and climate change threatens to cause major alterations to the hydrological cycle\u201d (\u201cWater Quality,\u201d International Decade for Water for Life 2005\u20132015, United Nations). In particular, human activities such as fertilizer and pesticide use for agriculture, directly impact the quality of runoff and the quality of water available for people and ecosystems. Irrigated agriculture is the world\u2019s largest water user, accounting for roughly 70% of total global freshwater withdrawals\u2014and up to 85% in some developing countries (World Energy Outlook 2016, p.351). Urbanization trends are also putting increasing demands on water while also impacting raw water quality and availability.\nLand use impacts for water topics identify key considerations pertaining to the impact of land use practices on the water and wastewater sectors, including water rights, watersheds, ecosystems, crop and plant selection, land use planning, urbanization, impervious area, material selection, irrigation practices, stormwater runoff, nonpoint-source pollution, and biofuels.\nWater is essential to the extraction of raw materials, and the processing, manufacture, and transport of goods. The main water consuming industries are discussed in under industry impacts, which include agriculture, thermoelectric power, and manufacturing. Industry is the second largest water consuming sector, after agricultural water use. In 2014, nearly 10% of global water withdrawals were for industrial use. This share is projected to remain steady over the next twenty years (World Energy Outlook 2016, p.352).\nThe water sector includes policies and best practices as they relate to the following key topics:\nPUBLICATION\nIEA\u2019s Energy Technology Perspectives 2024 report builds upon previous analysis, discussing the intersection of energy, manufacturing, and trade in regard\u2026\nSources:\nInternational Energy Agency\nDate:\n1 October 2024\nPUBLICATION\nThis paper reviews the fields of floatovoltaic technology (i.e., water-deployed solar photovoltaic systems) and aquaculture (i.e., farming of aquatic organisms)\u2026\nSources:\nRenewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews\nDate:\n1 December 2017\nPUBLICATION\nThis research explores which counties in Colorado may be best suited to reusing produced water for agriculture based on a\u2026\nSources:\nScience of the Total Environment\nDate:\n1 November 2018\nPUBLICATION\nThis article reviews city case studies to inform a framework for developing urban infrastructure design standards and policy instruments that\u2026\nSources:\nEnvironmental Progress and Sustainable Energy (AlChE)\nDate:\n3 November 2017\nTOOLS AND WEBSITES\nThe CWC studies how the wa\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Similar reductions in air pollution have been observed in other regions of the world.\nThese recent improvements in air quality have come at a high cost, as communities grapple with widespread lockdowns and shelter-in-place orders as a result of the spread of COVID-19. One air pollutant, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), is primarily emitted from burning fossil fuels (diesel, gasoline, coal), coming out of our tailpipes when driving cars and smokestacks when generating electricity. Therefore, changes in NO2 levels can be used as an indicator of changes in human activity. However, care must be taken when processing and interpreting satellite NO2 data as the quantity observed by the satellite is not exactly the same as the NO2 abundance at ground level. NO2 levels are influenced by dynamical and chemical processes in the atmosphere. For instance, atmospheric NO2 levels can vary day-to-day due to changes in the weather, which influences both the lifetime of NO2 molecules as well as the dispersal of the molecules by the wind. It is also important to note that satellites that observe NO2 cannot see through clouds, so all data shown is for days with low amounts of cloudiness. If processed and interpreted carefully, NO2 levels observed from space serve as an effective proxy for NO2 levels at Earth's surface. NASA's air quality group is also monitoring other air pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide (SO2). Major anthropogenic activities that emit SO2 include electricity generation, oil and gas extraction, and metal smelting. SO2 is emitted during electricity generation if the coal burned has sulfur impurities that are not removed (or not \u201cscrubbed\u201d) from the plant\u2019s exhaust stacks.

People exposed to it can suffer from heat strokes, heart attacks or exhaustion. Children, the elderly, low-income communities, outdoor workers, pregnant women, and socially isolated people are all especially vulnerable, but extreme heat can kill anyone.\nHeat isn\u2019t a new phenomenon. But as the planet gets hotter because of human-caused emissions, scientists are detecting more heat-related deaths. These are called \u2018excess deaths\u2019, a clunky phrase which counts additional premature deaths attributable to increasing heat.\nThe effects of recent extreme heatwaves have been widely reported. We now know that 61,000 people died in searing heat across Europe in the summer of 2022. Deadly heatwaves have also been observed in many other places, including China, South America, and the United States in the past two years. It\u2019s a climate justice issue because extreme heat has the worst impact on the world\u2019s poorest, who are least able to adapt to higher temperatures, while also having contributed the least to emissions. Afghanistan, Papua New Guinea and Central America are amongst some of the places considered to be most at risk from extreme heat because of increasing temperatures and lack of access to healthcare and energy to cool off.\nThe emission of greenhouse gases, primarily caused by burning fossil fuels, is driving this heat. Increasingly, these emission-driven temperatures are killing people \u2013 a recent study found that more than one-third of nearly 30 million heat-related deaths recorded globally between 1991\u20132018 are linked to climate change. Heat-related deaths are likely underestimated, according to environmental economist Dr Shouro Dasgupta, because deaths are not always recorded as related to heat.\nFor the first time, Global Witness analysis tries to determine corporate responsibility for these excess heat deaths. Recent studies have sought to assess what responsibility big polluting nations, or the top 1% of earners, bear for the climate crisis. But no one has yet sought to use this model to assess the impact of the companies who produce vast quantities of the oil and gas that is heating the planet, contributing to waves of early deaths.\nTo do this, we used two datasets. A researcher at Columbia University assessed the mortality cost of carbon, taking the relationship between carbon emissions and heat-related deaths, to understand the cost of emissions in human lives. This model estimates that every 1 million metric tonnes of CO2 emitted in 2020 will cause an additional 226 excess temperature-related deaths over the next 80 years.\nWe then cross reference that with supermajors\u2019 production of oil and gas. The five Western supermajors have defied calls from scientists to rapidly reduce emissions and continue to increase oil and gas production. In the past few months, ExxonMobil and Chevron have invested more than $100 billion into new oil and gas reserves. BP and Shell weakened their climate pledges. And TotalEnergies plans to ramp up production in the next few years.\nTaken together, Global Witness analysis of Rystad Energy data (see Notes on our Methodology) suggests that these five companies will dig up oil and gas, which when burned, will add 51 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere between now and 2050. Using Columbia\u2019s mortality cost of carbon methodology, we calculate that emissions from the supermajors\u2019 oil and gas would kill an additional 11.5 million people due to heat by 2100.\nThe estimates we\u2019re using are based on a high emissions scenario. Simply put, this is a business-as-usual world, in which we only pursue the climate policies in place right now. Columbia\u2019s research also provides a lower emissions scenario. This suggests that if the world were instead to dramatically reduce emissions and reach net zero by 2050, the mortality associated with the supermajors\u2019 emissions would be reduced to 5.5 million deaths, and thus be cut by more than half, saving millions of lives. Sadly at present the world is considerably off track when it comes to meeting even the climate goals we have in place now.\nAsking who is responsible for these deaths is a difficult, and relatively novel question. The ethical and legal systems that we use to determine responsibility were established long before the climate crisis. There are many actors involved in burning fossil fuels. Can we really apportion responsibility for the impact those fossil fuels have?\nWhen a company spills lethal chemicals into a river, and harms people, we hold it legally responsible. The American chemical company DuPont has paid out hundreds of millions of dollars for polluting drinking water with chemicals. Will this responsibility extend to carbon emissions, which we can increasingly link to the deaths of millions of people? Certainly, it\u2019s an argument the supermajors and their legal teams will be extremely concerned about.\nIn response, the supermajors will argue that they themselves do not burn much of the fuel they produce, and that societies and individuals, not companies, are responsible. They will rightly argue that governments have a role to play in mitigating the impacts of extreme heat. And they will say that even if you accept the science which links emissions and deaths, you also need to weigh up the alternative, a world without fossil fuels.\nIt\u2019s certainly true that the line of responsibility between carbon emissions and deaths from extreme heat is not as\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Simply put, this is a business-as-usual world, in which we only pursue the climate policies in place right now. Columbia\u2019s research also provides a lower emissions scenario. This suggests that if the world were instead to dramatically reduce emissions and reach net zero by 2050, the mortality associated with the supermajors\u2019 emissions would be reduced to 5.5 million deaths, and thus be cut by more than half, saving millions of lives. Sadly at present the world is considerably off track when it comes to meeting even the climate goals we have in place now.\nAsking who is responsible for these deaths is a difficult, and relatively novel question. The ethical and legal systems that we use to determine responsibility were established long before the climate crisis. There are many actors involved in burning fossil fuels. Can we really apportion responsibility for the impact those fossil fuels have?\nWhen a company spills lethal chemicals into a river, and harms people, we hold it legally responsible. The American chemical company DuPont has paid out hundreds of millions of dollars for polluting drinking water with chemicals. Will this responsibility extend to carbon emissions, which we can increasingly link to the deaths of millions of people? Certainly, it\u2019s an argument the supermajors and their legal teams will be extremely concerned about.\nIn response, the supermajors will argue that they themselves do not burn much of the fuel they produce, and that societies and individuals, not companies, are responsible. They will rightly argue that governments have a role to play in mitigating the impacts of extreme heat. And they will say that even if you accept the science which links emissions and deaths, you also need to weigh up the alternative, a world without fossil fuels.\nIt\u2019s certainly true that the line of responsibility between carbon emissions and deaths from extreme heat is not as\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Similar reductions in air pollution have been observed in other regions of the world.\nThese recent improvements in air quality have come at a high cost, as communities grapple with widespread lockdowns and shelter-in-place orders as a result of the spread of COVID-19. One air pollutant, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), is primarily emitted from burning fossil fuels (diesel, gasoline, coal), coming out of our tailpipes when driving cars and smokestacks when generating electricity. Therefore, changes in NO2 levels can be used as an indicator of changes in human activity. However, care must be taken when processing and interpreting satellite NO2 data as the quantity observed by the satellite is not exactly the same as the NO2 abundance at ground level. NO2 levels are influenced by dynamical and chemical processes in the atmosphere. For instance, atmospheric NO2 levels can vary day-to-day due to changes in the weather, which influences both the lifetime of NO2 molecules as well as the dispersal of the molecules by the wind. It is also important to note that satellites that observe NO2 cannot see through clouds, so all data shown is for days with low amounts of cloudiness. If processed and interpreted carefully, NO2 levels observed from space serve as an effective proxy for NO2 levels at Earth's surface. NASA's air quality group is also monitoring other air pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide (SO2). Major anthropogenic activities that emit SO2 include electricity generation, oil and gas extraction, and metal smelting. SO2 is emitted during electricity generation if the coal burned has sulfur impurities that are not removed (or not \u201cscrubbed\u201d) from the plant\u2019s exhaust stacks.

This review focuses on two key relationships between water and economic growth for developed and developing countries. Rising freshwater withdrawals and stress are directly related to how our economies use water to develop and grow. There is also concern that increasing water scarcity will impact economic growth across countries and regions. Unless there is a marked improvement in the water intensity of countries, economic growth will be the most important driver of increasing water withdrawals and scarcity. Although analysis of the impact of freshwater stress on the growth of economies is inconclusive, there is mounting evidence of an impact at the river basin and sub-national level. Decoupling rising water use from growth will require major water management reforms. Two of them are discussed here: Ending excessive subsidization of irrigation and reallocating subsidies for water supply and sanitation to expand delivery in developing countries.\nThe World Economic Forum has listed insufficient water for human, industry or ecosystem use as one of the most perilous global risks to economies over the next 10 years (WEF 2024). A key indicator of this growing problem is the level of freshwater stress, which is the amount of water withdrawn for consumptive use in irrigation, livestock, industry and domestic uses as a share of available freshwater resources (FAO 2021).\nTwenty-five countries, holding nearly one-quarter of the global population, face extreme high water stress each year, meaning they withdraw in consumptive use over 80% of their freshwater supplies. As many as 4 billion people, more than 50% of the world\u2019s population, are exposed to highly water-stressed conditions where withdrawals are at least 40% of supplies for at least a month a year (Kuzma et al. 2023).\nWater withdrawals are expected to grow, further straining available freshwater resources. Between 2020 and 2050, annual water withdrawals are predicted to increase from 4,395 billion cubic meters (m3) to 5,195 billion m3 (Burek et al. 2016). Other projections suggest that annual water withdrawals in 2050 will be 20\u201350% higher than they are today (Boretti and Rosa 2019; Kuzma et al. 2023). By 2040, global freshwater withdrawals will outstrip supply by 40% (Mazzucato et al. 2023). By 2050, an additional 1 billion people are expected to face extreme high-water stress, even if the world limits global temperature rise to 1.3\u20132.4\u00b0C (Kuzma et al. 2023). The extreme weather events accompanying climate change, including more frequent and severe droughts and heat waves, are likely to further exacerbate freshwater scarcity (Barbier 2022; Vicente-Serrano et al. 2022).\nThese trends highlight two key relationships between water and economic growth.\nFirst, rising freshwater withdrawals and stress are directly related to how our economies use water to develop and grow. The projected increase in water withdrawals over the coming decades will be driven by rapid population growth, socioeconomic development, urbanization and growing water needs from the agriculture, industry and energy sectors (Barbier 2019; Boretti and Rosa 2019; Kuzma et al. 2023; Mazzucato et al. 2023). Most of this increase in water use will occur in low and middle-income, or developing, countries. One of the most important uses of water in these countries will be to address unmet needs. In 2022, 2.2 billion people still lacked safely managed drinking water, and 3.5 billion people did not have safely managed sanitation (UN 2023). Given these expected increases in water use, economic growth is predicted to be the most important driver of increasing water withdrawal and scarcity over the long run, which will be further exacerbated by population growth and climate change (Boretti and Rosa 2019; DiStefano and Kelly 2017; Kuzma et al. 2023).\nSecond, there is a concern that increasing water scarcity will impact the prospects for per capita income growth across economies and regions (DiStefano and Kelly 2017; Kuzma et al. 2023; World Bank 2016). In 2010, 24% of global GDP ($15 trillion) was exposed to high water stress, whereas by 2020, 31% of global GDP ($70 trillion) will be exposed (Kuzma et al. 2023). Water scarcity, exacerbated by climate change, could cost some regions up to 6% of their GDP, spur migration, and spark conflict (World Bank 2016). Variations in rainfall and water availability, increasing water crises, and water pollution are also expected to impact agriculture and human capital, which would also impact growth (Damania 2020; Damania et al. 2019, 2020; Hertel and Liu 2019; Khan et al. 2017; Russ et al. 2022).\nThe following review explores these two relationships further. The next section examines recent trends in water withdrawals and stress in developing and developed countries. The growth in withdrawals is then decomposed through applying a \u201cwater\u201d Kaya identity, which is an approach frequently used to track the key factors underlying energy-related carbon emissions (Kaya 1995; Fankhauser and Jotzo 2018). The analysis indicates that decoupling water withdrawals from economic growth will require substantial reductions in the water intensity of economies, which is the amount of water used for every unit of economic output, usually measured in terms of cubic meter (m3) of total water withdrawal per $1,000 GDP (constant 2015). In addition, this review highlights and discusses the results of empirical investigations of water scarcity as a constraint on economic growth. The overall conclusion is that reducing the water intensity of economies and the potential threats posed by rising water scarcity to growth will require substantial changes in the incentives, institutions and governance that are behind the mismanagement of water in many economies.

Most of this increase in water use will occur in low and middle-income, or developing, countries. One of the most important uses of water in these countries will be to address unmet needs. In 2022, 2.2 billion people still lacked safely managed drinking water, and 3.5 billion people did not have safely managed sanitation (UN 2023). Given these expected increases in water use, economic growth is predicted to be the most important driver of increasing water withdrawal and scarcity over the long run, which will be further exacerbated by population growth and climate change (Boretti and Rosa 2019; DiStefano and Kelly 2017; Kuzma et al. 2023).\nSecond, there is a concern that increasing water scarcity will impact the prospects for per capita income growth across economies and regions (DiStefano and Kelly 2017; Kuzma et al. 2023; World Bank 2016). In 2010, 24% of global GDP ($15 trillion) was exposed to high water stress, whereas by 2020, 31% of global GDP ($70 trillion) will be exposed (Kuzma et al. 2023). Water scarcity, exacerbated by climate change, could cost some regions up to 6% of their GDP, spur migration, and spark conflict (World Bank 2016). Variations in rainfall and water availability, increasing water crises, and water pollution are also expected to impact agriculture and human capital, which would also impact growth (Damania 2020; Damania et al. 2019, 2020; Hertel and Liu 2019; Khan et al. 2017; Russ et al. 2022).\nThe following review explores these two relationships further. The next section examines recent trends in water withdrawals and stress in developing and developed countries. The growth in withdrawals is then decomposed through applying a \u201cwater\u201d Kaya identity, which is an approach frequently used to track the key factors underlying energy-related carbon emissions (Kaya 1995; Fankhauser and Jotzo 2018). The analysis indicates that decoupling water withdrawals from economic growth will require substantial reductions in the water intensity of economies, which is the amount of water used for every unit of economic output, usually measured in terms of cubic meter (m3) of total water withdrawal per $1,000 GDP (constant 2015). In addition, this review highlights and discusses the results of empirical investigations of water scarcity as a constraint on economic growth.

This review focuses on two key relationships between water and economic growth for developed and developing countries. Rising freshwater withdrawals and stress are directly related to how our economies use water to develop and grow. There is also concern that increasing water scarcity will impact economic growth across countries and regions. Unless there is a marked improvement in the water intensity of countries, economic growth will be the most important driver of increasing water withdrawals and scarcity. Although analysis of the impact of freshwater stress on the growth of economies is inconclusive, there is mounting evidence of an impact at the river basin and sub-national level. Decoupling rising water use from growth will require major water management reforms. Two of them are discussed here: Ending excessive subsidization of irrigation and reallocating subsidies for water supply and sanitation to expand delivery in developing countries.\nThe World Economic Forum has listed insufficient water for human, industry or ecosystem use as one of the most perilous global risks to economies over the next 10 years (WEF 2024). A key indicator of this growing problem is the level of freshwater stress, which is the amount of water withdrawn for consumptive use in irrigation, livestock, industry and domestic uses as a share of available freshwater resources (FAO 2021).\nTwenty-five countries, holding nearly one-quarter of the global population, face extreme high water stress each year, meaning they withdraw in consumptive use over 80% of their freshwater supplies. As many as 4 billion people, more than 50% of the world\u2019s population, are exposed to highly water-stressed conditions where withdrawals are at least 40% of supplies for at least a month a year (Kuzma et al. 2023).\nWater withdrawals are expected to grow, further straining available freshwater resources. Between 2020 and 2050, annual water withdrawals are predicted to increase from 4,395 billion cubic meters (m3) to 5,195 billion m3 (Burek et al. 2016). Other projections suggest that annual water withdrawals in 2050 will be 20\u201350% higher than they are today (Boretti and Rosa 2019; Kuzma et al. 2023). By 2040, global freshwater withdrawals will outstrip supply by 40% (Mazzucato et al. 2023). By 2050, an additional 1 billion people are expected to face extreme high-water stress, even if the world limits global temperature rise to 1.3\u20132.4\u00b0C (Kuzma et al. 2023).

People exposed to it can suffer from heat strokes, heart attacks or exhaustion. Children, the elderly, low-income communities, outdoor workers, pregnant women, and socially isolated people are all especially vulnerable, but extreme heat can kill anyone.\nHeat isn\u2019t a new phenomenon. But as the planet gets hotter because of human-caused emissions, scientists are detecting more heat-related deaths. These are called \u2018excess deaths\u2019, a clunky phrase which counts additional premature deaths attributable to increasing heat.\nThe effects of recent extreme heatwaves have been widely reported. We now know that 61,000 people died in searing heat across Europe in the summer of 2022. Deadly heatwaves have also been observed in many other places, including China, South America, and the United States in the past two years. It\u2019s a climate justice issue because extreme heat has the worst impact on the world\u2019s poorest, who are least able to adapt to higher temperatures, while also having contributed the least to emissions. Afghanistan, Papua New Guinea and Central America are amongst some of the places considered to be most at risk from extreme heat because of increasing temperatures and lack of access to healthcare and energy to cool off.\nThe emission of greenhouse gases, primarily caused by burning fossil fuels, is driving this heat. Increasingly, these emission-driven temperatures are killing people \u2013 a recent study found that more than one-third of nearly 30 million heat-related deaths recorded globally between 1991\u20132018 are linked to climate change. Heat-related deaths are likely underestimated, according to environmental economist Dr Shouro Dasgupta, because deaths are not always recorded as related to heat.\nFor the first time, Global Witness analysis tries to determine corporate responsibility for these excess heat deaths. Recent studies have sought to assess what responsibility big polluting nations, or the top 1% of earners, bear for the climate crisis. But no one has yet sought to use this model to assess the impact of the companies who produce vast quantities of the oil and gas that is heating the planet, contributing to waves of early deaths.\nTo do this, we used two datasets. A researcher at Columbia University assessed the mortality cost of carbon, taking the relationship between carbon emissions and heat-related deaths, to understand the cost of emissions in human lives. This model estimates that every 1 million metric tonnes of CO2 emitted in 2020 will cause an additional 226 excess temperature-related deaths over the next 80 years.\nWe then cross reference that with supermajors\u2019 production of oil and gas. The five Western supermajors have defied calls from scientists to rapidly reduce emissions and continue to increase oil and gas production. In the past few months, ExxonMobil and Chevron have invested more than $100 billion into new oil and gas reserves. BP and Shell weakened their climate pledges. And TotalEnergies plans to ramp up production in the next few years.\nTaken together, Global Witness analysis of Rystad Energy data (see Notes on our Methodology) suggests that these five companies will dig up oil and gas, which when burned, will add 51 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere between now and 2050. Using Columbia\u2019s mortality cost of carbon methodology, we calculate that emissions from the supermajors\u2019 oil and gas would kill an additional 11.5 million people due to heat by 2100.\nThe estimates we\u2019re using are based on a high emissions scenario. Simply put, this is a business-as-usual world, in which we only pursue the climate policies in place right now. Columbia\u2019s research also provides a lower emissions scenario. This suggests that if the world were instead to dramatically reduce emissions and reach net zero by 2050, the mortality associated with the supermajors\u2019 emissions would be reduced to 5.5 million deaths, and thus be cut by more than half, saving millions of lives. Sadly at present the world is considerably off track when it comes to meeting even the climate goals we have in place now.\nAsking who is responsible for these deaths is a difficult, and relatively novel question. The ethical and legal systems that we use to determine responsibility were established long before the climate crisis. There are many actors involved in burning fossil fuels. Can we really apportion responsibility for the impact those fossil fuels have?\nWhen a company spills lethal chemicals into a river, and harms people, we hold it legally responsible. The American chemical company DuPont has paid out hundreds of millions of dollars for polluting drinking water with chemicals. Will this responsibility extend to carbon emissions, which we can increasingly link to the deaths of millions of people? Certainly, it\u2019s an argument the supermajors and their legal teams will be extremely concerned about.\nIn response, the supermajors will argue that they themselves do not burn much of the fuel they produce, and that societies and individuals, not companies, are responsible. They will rightly argue that governments have a role to play in mitigating the impacts of extreme heat. And they will say that even if you accept the science which links emissions and deaths, you also need to weigh up the alternative, a world without fossil fuels.\nIt\u2019s certainly true that the line of responsibility between carbon emissions and deaths from extreme heat is not as\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Daniel Bressler calls \u201cthe mortality cost of carbon.\u201d\n\u201cThe question is, how many excess deaths do you get when you increase emissions by some amount,\u201d Bressler, a Ph.D. candidate at Columbia University, told The Hill.\nIf emissions continue unabated, his model found, 75 million additional people will die from heat-related causes who would otherwise survive if the world reaches net zero by 2050.\nThe model also helps put the social costs of carbon into perspective.\nBy factoring in more recent research on the effects of climate change into the leading model for assessing carbon costs, Bressler came up with far higher numbers: at the high end, $258 per ton, which assumes that emissions continue at their current rate. That\u2019s more than five times the price being considered by the Biden administration, and a far stronger policy impetus for cutting carbon emissions.\nBased on Bressler\u2019s model, a power plant that produces a million tons of carbon dioxide for a single year would lead to 226 excess deaths over the next 80 years.\nOn a smaller scale, the lifetime emissions of every 3.5 Americans \u2014 slightly over the size of the average family \u2014 would kill one additional person worldwide over the next 80 years, though this is more a metric of how carbon-intensive existing U.S. infrastructure and lifestyles are than a result of individual choice.\nIn far-poorer Nigeria, for comparison, Bressler found that it would take the emissions of nearly 150 people to reach one additional death, or nearly 13 people emitting at the global average.\nThis discrepancy gives grim emphasis to the demand made by India at last week\u2019s Group of 20 meeting for wealthier countries to cut their per-capita carbon emissions to at least the global average by 2030, according to the Hindustan Times.\nBressler\u2019s study attempts to unravel a key problem with the social cost of carbon that was identified in a 2017 report by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The NAS report critiqued the fact that the social cost of carbon is typically presented as a single price, like the Obama administration\u2019s $50.\nThat leaves policymakers little transparency about either the actual quantities of the individual factors that go into that single number \u2014 such as excess deaths or sea level rise \u2014 or the price that economists have assigned to it.\nAnd because the social cost of carbon is largely based on the impacts of carbon emissions on future generations, it requires economists to decide the degree of generational damage they could accept \u2014 a consideration as much moral or ethical as it is scientific.\nThat\u2019s why the NAS called for scientists and economists to work to \u201cdisaggregate\u201d the social cost of carbon by breaking it apart into its component parts so that policymakers would have clearer numbers to work with.\nIn addition to breaking impacts down by sector, the NAS report suggested they do so by giving impacts not only in price but also in \u201cnatural numbers\u201d \u2014 which for mortality is, of course, number of deaths.\nWhen Bressler factored mortality into the social cost of carbon, he ended up with a number that was far higher than the one delivered by one of the concept\u2019s key pioneers. Nobel laureate William Nordhaus, in a 2017 paper in PNAS, set the price at $31.\nNordhaus\u2019s model remains the industry standard. The Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy model (DICE) was introduced in 1994 and won him the Nobel Prize for economics in 2018.\nThat is relevant because based on those prices as compared to the cost of getting off carbon fuels, Nordhaus calculated that the optimal strategy was for carbon emissions to plateau by mid-century, then slowly decline.\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely standing on the shoulders of his work,\u201d Bressler said. The DICE formula makes up the skeleton of his model, but he believes his focus on mortality significantly updates Nordhaus\u2019s $31 figure.\nThe risks associated with climate change are far more dire than thought in 2017 \u2014 a fact Nordhaus acknowledged in his 2018 Nobel acceptance speech, when he recommended that governments reassess the social cost of carbon each year.\nThe last four years haven\u2019t just changed economists\u2019 estimates of the costs of carbon, they have also driven those costs up. That\u2019s because the impacts of carbon emissions are nonlinear, Bressler noted. Every additional ton of carbon released, or fraction of a degree of global heating, inflicts more damage than the one that comes before.\n\u201cAs you get toward 3 or 4 degrees Celsius of warming, you cause a significant number of excess deaths,\u201d Bressler said, noting the graph of additional mortality becomes a steep exponential curve \u2014 what economists call \u201cconvex.\u201d\nIn other words, if temperatures have already risen 3.5 degrees Celsius, an additional tenth of a degree will be far more deadly \u2014 and therefore costly \u2014 than it would if temperatures only rise 1.5 degrees.\nThat exponential difference means that different global strategies for addressing climate change also change the social and mortality costs of carbon.\nWhile Bressler\u2019s model estimates that the social cost of carbon was $258 under current emissions, that number falls to $158 in a scenario where the world aggressively moves to reach net zero emissio\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

People exposed to it can suffer from heat strokes, heart attacks or exhaustion. Children, the elderly, low-income communities, outdoor workers, pregnant women, and socially isolated people are all especially vulnerable, but extreme heat can kill anyone.\nHeat isn\u2019t a new phenomenon. But as the planet gets hotter because of human-caused emissions, scientists are detecting more heat-related deaths. These are called \u2018excess deaths\u2019, a clunky phrase which counts additional premature deaths attributable to increasing heat.\nThe effects of recent extreme heatwaves have been widely reported. We now know that 61,000 people died in searing heat across Europe in the summer of 2022. Deadly heatwaves have also been observed in many other places, including China, South America, and the United States in the past two years. It\u2019s a climate justice issue because extreme heat has the worst impact on the world\u2019s poorest, who are least able to adapt to higher temperatures, while also having contributed the least to emissions. Afghanistan, Papua New Guinea and Central America are amongst some of the places considered to be most at risk from extreme heat because of increasing temperatures and lack of access to healthcare and energy to cool off.\nThe emission of greenhouse gases, primarily caused by burning fossil fuels, is driving this heat. Increasingly, these emission-driven temperatures are killing people \u2013 a recent study found that more than one-third of nearly 30 million heat-related deaths recorded globally between 1991\u20132018 are linked to climate change. Heat-related deaths are likely underestimated, according to environmental economist Dr Shouro Dasgupta, because deaths are not always recorded as related to heat.\nFor the first time, Global Witness analysis tries to determine corporate responsibility for these excess heat deaths. Recent studies have sought to assess what responsibility big polluting nations, or the top 1% of earners, bear for the climate crisis. But no one has yet sought to use this model to assess the impact of the companies who produce vast quantities of the oil and gas that is heating the planet, contributing to waves of early deaths.\nTo do this, we used two datasets. A researcher at Columbia University assessed the mortality cost of carbon, taking the relationship between carbon emissions and heat-related deaths, to understand the cost of emissions in human lives. This model estimates that every 1 million metric tonnes of CO2 emitted in 2020 will cause an additional 226 excess temperature-related deaths over the next 80 years.\nWe then cross reference that with supermajors\u2019 production of oil and gas. The five Western supermajors have defied calls from scientists to rapidly reduce emissions and continue to increase oil and gas production. In the past few months, ExxonMobil and Chevron have invested more than $100 billion into new oil and gas reserves. BP and Shell weakened their climate pledges. And TotalEnergies plans to ramp up production in the next few years.\nTaken together, Global Witness analysis of Rystad Energy data (see Notes on our Methodology) suggests that these five companies will dig up oil and gas, which when burned, will add 51 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere between now and 2050. Using Columbia\u2019s mortality cost of carbon methodology, we calculate that emissions from the supermajors\u2019 oil and gas would kill an additional 11.5 million people due to heat by 2100.\nThe estimates we\u2019re using are based on a high emissions scenario. Simply put, this is a business-as-usual world, in which we only pursue the climate policies in place right now. Columbia\u2019s research also provides a lower emissions scenario. This suggests that if the world were instead to dramatically reduce emissions and reach net zero by 2050, the mortality associated with the supermajors\u2019 emissions would be reduced to 5.5 million deaths, and thus be cut by more than half, saving millions of lives. Sadly at present the world is considerably off track when it comes to meeting even the climate goals we have in place now.\nAsking who is responsible for these deaths is a difficult, and relatively novel question. The ethical and legal systems that we use to determine responsibility were established long before the climate crisis. There are many actors involved in burning fossil fuels. Can we really apportion responsibility for the impact those fossil fuels have?\nWhen a company spills lethal chemicals into a river, and harms people, we hold it legally responsible. The American chemical company DuPont has paid out hundreds of millions of dollars for polluting drinking water with chemicals. Will this responsibility extend to carbon emissions, which we can increasingly link to the deaths of millions of people? Certainly, it\u2019s an argument the supermajors and their legal teams will be extremely concerned about.\nIn response, the supermajors will argue that they themselves do not burn much of the fuel they produce, and that societies and individuals, not companies, are responsible. They will rightly argue that governments have a role to play in mitigating the impacts of extreme heat. And they will say that even if you accept the science which links emissions and deaths, you also need to weigh up the alternative, a world without fossil fuels.\nIt\u2019s certainly true that the line of responsibility between carbon emissions and deaths from extreme heat is not as\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

That\u2019s because people recognize renewable energy is important for our health, climate, and economy.\nBut what is renewable energy, and what benefits does it offer?\nRenewable energy comes from sources like the sun and wind that \u201crenew\u201d naturally, so they don\u2019t run out. Clean renewable energy lets us avoid the pollution and harm to our climate caused by burning fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and fossil gas (commonly called methane or natural gas).\nThere are many positive impacts of generating electricity from renewable energy sources, including the benefits of wind, solar, geothermal, hydroelectric and some negative impacts.\nRenewable energy is a powerful tool against the deadly, ongoing harms fossil fuels cause, particularly to people living near power plants, near places where the fuels are extracted, or near fossil fuel waste disposal sites. People of color and people with low incomes experience these health effects disproportionately given the long history of discriminatory siting of fossil fuel-related infrastructure.\nMost of fossil fuels\u2019 negative health impacts come from air and water pollution that the more prevalent renewable energy technologies simply don\u2019t produce once they are installed. When we generate electricity with renewable energy sources, we avoid health-harming fossil fuel plant emissions such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and particulate matter (including PM2.5). These pollutants can cause asthma and breathing difficulties, brain damage, heart problems, cancer, neurological disorders, and premature death. Renewable energy also avoids the health impacts of air and water pollution associated with fossil fuel extraction and transport, and waste streams such as coal ash.\nWind, solar, and hydroelectric systems generate electricity with no associated air pollution emissions. Geothermal\u2019s total emissions are generally much lower than those of coal- and gas-fired power plants. For biomass systems, emissions benefits range from marginal to significant depending on the type of biomass used and the method for converting it to electricity.\nA 2023 UCS study found significant drops in air pollution and related health benefits if we switch to renewable energy sources by 2050. UCS found reductions in nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter pollutants could result in $400 million to $800 million in public health benefits and tens of thousands of avoided deaths in 2050. The study showed how that could be achieved, even with the increase in electricity demand from widespread electrification of transportation and other parts of the economy.\nRenewable energy offers strong economic benefits thanks to its ability to generate abundant, high-quality jobs. Solar panels and wind turbines need lots of people on site to install them, and more people throughout the life of each project.\nOn average, more jobs are created for each unit of electricity generated from renewable sources than from fossil fuels.\nIn addition to the jobs directly created in the renewable energy industry, growth in clean energy can create positive economic \u201cripple\u201d effects, creating additional, indirect jobs based on the increased economic activity. For example, both industries in the renewable energy supply chain and local businesses benefit from increased local incomes and revenue in communities with renewable energy sites.\nRenewable energy contributes to economic development in other ways, too. Landowners lease land to energy project developers and often receive lease payments, royalties, or payments for power line easements and road rights-of-way. The ability to host a renewable energy facility can provide income to a farmer whose land no longer has access to water. And local and state governments benefit from property and income taxes and other payments from renewable energy project owners. State and local taxes by the US wind industry alone totaled an estimated $1 billion in 2022.\nThe jobs and other economic benefits have resulted from substantial investments in renewable energy projects. In 2024 alone, investment in US renewables totaled more than $300 billion.\nGet the latest updates on our work to make clean energy choices and how you can help right from your inbox.\nSIGN UP TODAY\nRenewable energy also avoids the significant impacts that fossil fuel exploration and production can have on the water supply. Both coal mining and gas drilling can pollute sources of drinking water. And virtually all thermal power plants\u2014including those powered by coal, gas, oil, as well as nuclear\u2014withdraw and consume large amounts of water.\nWind and solar energy facilities largely avoid harming water quality by requiring essentially no water to operate.\nWater scarcity is another risk for fossil fueled power plants\u2014one that solar and wind systems don\u2019t face. Coal, nuclear, and many gas plants depend on having sufficient water for cooling, which means that severe droughts and heat waves can put electricity generation at risk.\nBecause wind and solar power systems do not require water to generate electricity, they can operate reliably in conditions that may require other, water-dependent power plants to dial back their output or shut down completely.

Sunlight and wind, for example, are such sources that are constantly being replenished. Renewable energy sources are plentiful and all around us.\nFossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - on the other hand, are non-renewable resources that take hundreds of millions of years to form.

Clean renewable energy lets us avoid the pollution and harm to our climate caused by burning fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and fossil gas (commonly called methane or natural gas).\nThere are many positive impacts of generating electricity from renewable energy sources, including the benefits of wind, solar, geothermal, hydroelectric and some negative impacts.\nRenewable energy is a powerful tool against the deadly, ongoing harms fossil fuels cause, particularly to people living near power plants, near places where the fuels are extracted, or near fossil fuel waste disposal sites. People of color and people with low incomes experience these health effects disproportionately given the long history of discriminatory siting of fossil fuel-related infrastructure.\nMost of fossil fuels\u2019 negative health impacts come from air and water pollution that the more prevalent renewable energy technologies simply don\u2019t produce once they are installed. When we generate electricity with renewable energy sources, we avoid health-harming fossil fuel plant emissions such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and particulate matter (including PM2.5). These pollutants can cause asthma and breathing difficulties, brain damage, heart problems, cancer, neurological disorders, and premature death. Renewable energy also avoids the health impacts of air and water pollution associated with fossil fuel extraction and transport, and waste streams such as coal ash.\nWind, solar, and hydroelectric systems generate electricity with no associated air pollution emissions. Geothermal\u2019s total emissions are generally much lower than those of coal- and gas-fired power plants. For biomass systems, emissions benefits range from marginal to significant depending on the type of biomass used and the method for converting it to electricity.\nA 2023 UCS study found significant drops in air pollution and related health benefits if we switch to renewable energy sources by 2050. UCS found reductions in nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter pollutants could result in $400 million to $800 million in public health benefits and tens of thousands of avoided deaths in 2050. The study showed how that could be achieved, even with the increase in electricity demand from widespread electrification of transportation and other parts of the economy.\nRenewable energy offers strong economic benefits thanks to its ability to generate abundant, high-quality jobs. Solar panels and wind turbines need lots of people on site to install them, and more people throughout the life of each project.\nOn average, more jobs are created for each unit of electricity generated from renewable sources than from fossil fuels.\nIn addition to the jobs directly created in the renewable energy industry, growth in clean energy can create positive economic \u201cripple\u201d effects, creating additional, indirect jobs based on the increased economic activity. For example, both industries in the renewable energy supply chain and local businesses benefit from increased local incomes and revenue in communities with renewable energy sites.\nRenewable energy contributes to economic development in other ways, too. Landowners lease land to energy project developers and often receive lease payments, royalties, or payments for power line easements and road rights-of-way. The ability to host a renewable energy facility can provide income to a farmer whose land no longer has access to water. And local and state governments benefit from property and income taxes and other payments from renewable energy project owners. State and local taxes by the US wind industry alone totaled an estimated $1 billion in 2022.\nThe jobs and other economic benefits have resulted from substantial investments in renewable energy projects. In 2024 alone, investment in US renewables totaled more than $300 billion.\nGet the latest updates on our work to make clean energy choices and how you can help right from your inbox.\nSIGN UP TODAY\nRenewable energy also avoids the significant impacts that fossil fuel exploration and production can have on the water supply. Both coal mining and gas drilling can pollute sources of drinking water. And virtually all thermal power plants\u2014including those powered by coal, gas, oil, as well as nuclear\u2014withdraw and consume large amounts of water.\nWind and solar energy facilities largely avoid harming water quality by requiring essentially no water to operate.\nWater scarcity is another risk for fossil fueled power plants\u2014one that solar and wind systems don\u2019t face. Coal, nuclear, and many gas plants depend on having sufficient water for cooling, which means that severe droughts and heat waves can put electricity generation at risk.\nBecause wind and solar power systems do not require water to generate electricity, they can operate reliably in conditions that may require other, water-dependent power plants to dial back their output or shut down completely. Even as biomass and geothermal power plants may require water for cooling, and hydroelectric plants may disrupt river ecosystems, total water consumption and withdrawal by the power sector would still be significantly lower with high renewable energy use.\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) is the most prevalent greenhouse gas, but other air pollutants\u2014such as methane\u2014also cause climate change.

Only 3% of Earth\u2019s water is freshwater, and only 0.5% of all water is accessible and safe for human consumption. Freshwater is critical for survival. On average, a human being can live without water for only three days. Increasing drought and water shortages are reducing water availability. Meanwhile, data center developers are increasingly tapping into surface and underground aquifers to cool their facilities.\nData center water usage closely parallels energy usage and carbon emissions. As data centers use more energy for their typical data center operations and to meet AI requests, they consume larger amounts of water to cool their processor chips, so as to avoid overheating and potential damage. Similarly, as energy use increases in data centers, so do carbon emissions.\nA medium-sized data center can consume up to roughly 110 million gallons of water per year for cooling purposes, equivalent to the annual water usage of approximately 1,000 households. Larger data centers can each \u201cdrink\u201d up to 5 million gallons per day, or about 1.8 billion annually, usage equivalent to a town of 10,000 to 50,000 people. Together, the nation\u2019s 5,426 data centers consume billions of gallons of water annually. One report estimated that U.S. data centers consume 449 million gallons of water per day and 163.7 billion gallons annually (as of 2021). A 2016 report found that fewer than one-third of data center operators track water consumption. Water consumption is expected to continue increasing as data centers grow in number, size, and complexity.\nAccording to scientists at the University of California, Riverside, each 100-word AI prompt is estimated to use roughly one bottle of water (or 519 milliliters). This may not sound like much, but billions of AI users worldwide enter prompts into systems like ChatGPT every minute. Large language models require many energy-intensive calculations, necessitating liquid cooling systems.\nThe Water Cycle of Data Centers\nA data center\u2019s water footprint is calculated as the sum of three categories: on-site water usage, water use by power plant facilities that supply power to data centers, and water consumption during the manufacturing process of processor chips. Water can come from various sources, including blue sources (e.g., surface water and groundwater), piped sources such as municipal water, and gray sources (e.g., purified reclaimed water). Using recycled or non-potable water to meet a data center\u2019s cooling needs is a well-established practice to conserve limited potable water resources, particularly in dry or drought-prone areas.\nIn the context of data centers, \u201cwater consumption\u201d refers to the amount of water withdrawn from blue or gray sources minus the water discharged by the centers (primarily warm water left over from cooling the IT racks). The consumed water is generally the water that evaporates or is otherwise taken out of immediate human usage. Withdrawal of fresh water from local streams or underground aquifers may lead to aquifer exhaustion, particularly in water-stressed areas.\nResearchers at The Green Grid, a nonprofit industry consortium, developed a metric called Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE) to measure water usage by data centers. Similar to the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) metric, which measures the energy efficiency of a data center, the WUE metric assesses the efficiency of a data center\u2019s water use. WUE is reported in liters per kilowatt-hour (kWh): a data center\u2019s total water consumption, measured in liters, is divided by the total energy consumed by that data center in kilowatt-hours in the same time period. While \u201c0\u201d is the ideal WUE score, this can only be achieved in air-cooled data centers, and most data centers cannot meet this target due to their location\u2019s climate conditions. The average WUE across data centers is 1.9 liters per kWh, which is a great goal to beat.\nData centers' water usage depends on various factors, including location, climate, water availability, size, and IT rack chip densities. In hotter climates, like in the southwest United States, data centers need to use more water to cool the building and equipment. With the increasing number of centers supporting AI requests, chip density is also growing, which leads to higher room temperatures, necessitating the use of more water chillers at the server level to maintain cool temperatures. Most data centers use a combination of chillers and on-site cooling towers to avoid chip overheating.\nCooling data centers is a complex operation. At the server level, water chillers cool IT rooms to maintain optimal temperatures and prevent damage to chips. This can be achieved through air cooling using water evaporation, which is an open-loop and more water-intensive method, or through server liquid cooling. Server cooling is a more expensive approach that delivers the liquid coolant directly to the graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs). Direct-to-chip liquid cooling and immersive liquid cooling are two standard server liquid cooling technologies that dissipate heat while significantly reducing water consumption. During immersive cooling, water or specialized synthetic liquids flood the chips, absorbing the heat. The difference between direct server liquid cooling and air cooling through evaporation can be compared to the difference between drip irrigation and flooding in agriculture.\nIn areas with limited water availability, server liquid cooling is the best choice, as it requires minimal water consumption. Conversely, in areas with a strained power grid, an evaporative air cooling tower is a suitable building design, as it requires minimal power usage.\nRegardless of the approach chosen, a heat exchanger is necessary to capture the hot air or hot water produced as a byproduct of the cooling process.

That\u2019s because people recognize renewable energy is important for our health, climate, and economy.\nBut what is renewable energy, and what benefits does it offer?\nRenewable energy comes from sources like the sun and wind that \u201crenew\u201d naturally, so they don\u2019t run out. Clean renewable energy lets us avoid the pollution and harm to our climate caused by burning fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and fossil gas (commonly called methane or natural gas).\nThere are many positive impacts of generating electricity from renewable energy sources, including the benefits of wind, solar, geothermal, hydroelectric and some negative impacts.\nRenewable energy is a powerful tool against the deadly, ongoing harms fossil fuels cause, particularly to people living near power plants, near places where the fuels are extracted, or near fossil fuel waste disposal sites. People of color and people with low incomes experience these health effects disproportionately given the long history of discriminatory siting of fossil fuel-related infrastructure.\nMost of fossil fuels\u2019 negative health impacts come from air and water pollution that the more prevalent renewable energy technologies simply don\u2019t produce once they are installed. When we generate electricity with renewable energy sources, we avoid health-harming fossil fuel plant emissions such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and particulate matter (including PM2.5). These pollutants can cause asthma and breathing difficulties, brain damage, heart problems, cancer, neurological disorders, and premature death. Renewable energy also avoids the health impacts of air and water pollution associated with fossil fuel extraction and transport, and waste streams such as coal ash.\nWind, solar, and hydroelectric systems generate electricity with no associated air pollution emissions. Geothermal\u2019s total emissions are generally much lower than those of coal- and gas-fired power plants. For biomass systems, emissions benefits range from marginal to significant depending on the type of biomass used and the method for converting it to electricity.\nA 2023 UCS study found significant drops in air pollution and related health benefits if we switch to renewable energy sources by 2050. UCS found reductions in nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter pollutants could result in $400 million to $800 million in public health benefits and tens of thousands of avoided deaths in 2050. The study showed how that could be achieved, even with the increase in electricity demand from widespread electrification of transportation and other parts of the economy.\nRenewable energy offers strong economic benefits thanks to its ability to generate abundant, high-quality jobs. Solar panels and wind turbines need lots of people on site to install them, and more people throughout the life of each project.\nOn average, more jobs are created for each unit of electricity generated from renewable sources than from fossil fuels.\nIn addition to the jobs directly created in the renewable energy industry, growth in clean energy can create positive economic \u201cripple\u201d effects, creating additional, indirect jobs based on the increased economic activity. For example, both industries in the renewable energy supply chain and local businesses benefit from increased local incomes and revenue in communities with renewable energy sites.\nRenewable energy contributes to economic development in other ways, too. Landowners lease land to energy project developers and often receive lease payments, royalties, or payments for power line easements and road rights-of-way. The ability to host a renewable energy facility can provide income to a farmer whose land no longer has access to water. And local and state governments benefit from property and income taxes and other payments from renewable energy project owners. State and local taxes by the US wind industry alone totaled an estimated $1 billion in 2022.\nThe jobs and other economic benefits have resulted from substantial investments in renewable energy projects. In 2024 alone, investment in US renewables totaled more than $300 billion.\nGet the latest updates on our work to make clean energy choices and how you can help right from your inbox.\nSIGN UP TODAY\nRenewable energy also avoids the significant impacts that fossil fuel exploration and production can have on the water supply. Both coal mining and gas drilling can pollute sources of drinking water. And virtually all thermal power plants\u2014including those powered by coal, gas, oil, as well as nuclear\u2014withdraw and consume large amounts of water.\nWind and solar energy facilities largely avoid harming water quality by requiring essentially no water to operate.\nWater scarcity is another risk for fossil fueled power plants\u2014one that solar and wind systems don\u2019t face. Coal, nuclear, and many gas plants depend on having sufficient water for cooling, which means that severe droughts and heat waves can put electricity generation at risk.\nBecause wind and solar power systems do not require water to generate electricity, they can operate reliably in conditions that may require other, water-dependent power plants to dial back their output or shut down completely. Even as biomass and geothermal power plants may require water for cooling, and hydroelectric plants may disrupt river ecosystems, total water consumption and withdrawal by the power sector would still be significantly lower with high renewable energy use.\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) is the most prevalent greenhouse gas, but other air pollutants\u2014such as methane\u2014also cause climate change. Different energy sources produce different amounts of these pollutants. To make comparisons easier, we use a carbon dioxide equivalent, or CO2e\u2014the amount of carbon dioxide required to produce an equivalent amount of warming.\nTackling climate change is another critical benefit \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Only 3% of Earth\u2019s water is freshwater, and only 0.5% of all water is accessible and safe for human consumption. Freshwater is critical for survival. On average, a human being can live without water for only three days. Increasing drought and water shortages are reducing water availability. Meanwhile, data center developers are increasingly tapping into surface and underground aquifers to cool their facilities.\nData center water usage closely parallels energy usage and carbon emissions. As data centers use more energy for their typical data center operations and to meet AI requests, they consume larger amounts of water to cool their processor chips, so as to avoid overheating and potential damage. Similarly, as energy use increases in data centers, so do carbon emissions.\nA medium-sized data center can consume up to roughly 110 million gallons of water per year for cooling purposes, equivalent to the annual water usage of approximately 1,000 households. Larger data centers can each \u201cdrink\u201d up to 5 million gallons per day, or about 1.8 billion annually, usage equivalent to a town of 10,000 to 50,000 people. Together, the nation\u2019s 5,426 data centers consume billions of gallons of water annually. One report estimated that U.S. data centers consume 449 million gallons of water per day and 163.7 billion gallons annually (as of 2021). A 2016 report found that fewer than one-third of data center operators track water consumption. Water consumption is expected to continue increasing as data centers grow in number, size, and complexity.\nAccording to scientists at the University of California, Riverside, each 100-word AI prompt is estimated to use roughly one bottle of water (or 519 milliliters). This may not sound like much, but billions of AI users worldwide enter prompts into systems like ChatGPT every minute. Large language models require many energy-intensive calculations, necessitating liquid cooling systems.\nThe Water Cycle of Data Centers\nA data center\u2019s water footprint is calculated as the sum of three categories: on-site water usage, water use by power plant facilities that supply power to data centers, and water consumption during the manufacturing process of processor chips. Water can come from various sources, including blue sources (e.g., surface water and groundwater), piped sources such as municipal water, and gray sources (e.g., purified reclaimed water). Using recycled or non-potable water to meet a data center\u2019s cooling needs is a well-established practice to conserve limited potable water resources, particularly in dry or drought-prone areas.\nIn the context of data centers, \u201cwater consumption\u201d refers to the amount of water withdrawn from blue or gray sources minus the water discharged by the centers (primarily warm water left over from cooling the IT racks). The consumed water is generally the water that evaporates or is otherwise taken out of immediate human usage. Withdrawal of fresh water from local streams or underground aquifers may lead to aquifer exhaustion, particularly in water-stressed areas.\nResearchers at The Green Grid, a nonprofit industry consortium, developed a metric called Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE) to measure water usage by data centers. Similar to the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) metric, which measures the energy efficiency of a data center, the WUE metric assesses the efficiency of a data center\u2019s water use. WUE is reported in liters per kilowatt-hour (kWh): a data center\u2019s total water consumption, measured in liters, is divided by the total energy consumed by that data center in kilowatt-hours in the same time period. While \u201c0\u201d is the ideal WUE score, this can only be achieved in air-cooled data centers, and most data centers cannot meet this target due to their location\u2019s climate conditions. The average WUE across data centers is 1.9 liters per kWh, which is a great goal to beat.\nData centers' water usage depends on various factors, including location, climate, water availability, size, and IT rack chip densities. In hotter climates, like in the southwest United States, data centers need to use more water to cool the building and equipment. With the increasing number of centers supporting AI requests, chip density is also growing, which leads to higher room temperatures, necessitating the use of more water chillers at the server level to maintain cool temperatures. Most data centers use a combination of chillers and on-site cooling towers to avoid chip overheating.\nCooling data centers is a complex operation. At the server level, water chillers cool IT rooms to maintain optimal temperatures and prevent damage to chips. This can be achieved through air cooling using water evaporation, which is an open-loop and more water-intensive method, or through server liquid cooling. Server cooling is a more expensive approach that delivers the liquid coolant directly to the graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs). Direct-to-chip liquid cooling and immersive liquid cooling are two standard server liquid cooling technologies that dissipate heat while significantly reducing water consumption. During immersive cooling, water or specialized synthetic liquids flood the chips, absorbing the heat. The difference between direct server liquid cooling and air cooling through evaporation can be compared to the difference between drip irrigation and flooding in agriculture.\nIn areas with limited water availability, server liquid cooling is the best choice, as it requires minimal water consumption. Conversely, in areas with a strained power grid, an evaporative air cooling tower is a suitable building design, as it requires minimal power usage.\nRegardless of the approach chosen, a heat exchanger is necessary to capture the hot air or hot water produced as a byproduct of the cooling process.

With the increasing number of centers supporting AI requests, chip density is also growing, which leads to higher room temperatures, necessitating the use of more water chillers at the server level to maintain cool temperatures. Most data centers use a combination of chillers and on-site cooling towers to avoid chip overheating.\nCooling data centers is a complex operation. At the server level, water chillers cool IT rooms to maintain optimal temperatures and prevent damage to chips.

Server cooling is a more expensive approach that delivers the liquid coolant directly to the graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs). Direct-to-chip liquid cooling and immersive liquid cooling are two standard server liquid cooling technologies that dissipate heat while significantly reducing water consumption.

The difference between direct server liquid cooling and air cooling through evaporation can be compared to the difference between drip irrigation and flooding in agriculture.\nIn areas with limited water availability, server liquid cooling is the best choice, as it requires minimal water consumption.

Meanwhile, maintaining global water supply is dependent on energy.\n\nFull Page Content:\nJune 25, 2025\nHighlights:\nAI/Data Center Resources\nData centers have a thirst for water, and their rapid expansion threatens freshwater supplies. Only 3% of Earth\u2019s water is freshwater, and only 0.5% of all water is accessible and safe for human consumption. Freshwater is critical for survival. On average, a human being can live without water for only three days. Increasing drought and water shortages are reducing water availability. Meanwhile, data center developers are increasingly tapping into surface and underground aquifers to cool their facilities.\nData center water usage closely parallels energy usage and carbon emissions. As data centers use more energy for their typical data center operations and to meet AI requests, they consume larger amounts of water to cool their processor chips, so as to avoid overheating and potential damage. Similarly, as energy use increases in data centers, so do carbon emissions.\nA medium-sized data center can consume up to roughly 110 million gallons of water per year for cooling purposes, equivalent to the annual water usage of approximately 1,000 households. Larger data centers can each \u201cdrink\u201d up to 5 million gallons per day, or about 1.8 billion annually, usage equivalent to a town of 10,000 to 50,000 people. Together, the nation\u2019s 5,426 data centers consume billions of gallons of water annually. One report estimated that U.S. data centers consume 449 million gallons of water per day and 163.7 billion gallons annually (as of 2021). A 2016 report found that fewer than one-third of data center operators track water consumption. Water consumption is expected to continue increasing as data centers grow in number, size, and complexity.\nAccording to scientists at the University of California, Riverside, each 100-word AI prompt is estimated to use roughly one bottle of water (or 519 milliliters). This may not sound like much, but billions of AI users worldwide enter prompts into systems like ChatGPT every minute. Large language models require many energy-intensive calculations, necessitating liquid cooling systems.\nThe Water Cycle of Data Centers\nA data center\u2019s water footprint is calculated as the sum of three categories: on-site water usage, water use by power plant facilities that supply power to data centers, and water consumption during the manufacturing process of processor chips. Water can come from various sources, including blue sources (e.g., surface water and groundwater), piped sources such as municipal water, and gray sources (e.g., purified reclaimed water). Using recycled or non-potable water to meet a data center\u2019s cooling needs is a well-established practice to conserve limited potable water resources, particularly in dry or drought-prone areas.\nIn the context of data centers, \u201cwater consumption\u201d refers to the amount of water withdrawn from blue or gray sources minus the water discharged by the centers (primarily warm water left over from cooling the IT racks). The consumed water is generally the water that evaporates or is otherwise taken out of immediate human usage. Withdrawal of fresh water from local streams or underground aquifers may lead to aquifer exhaustion, particularly in water-stressed areas.\nResearchers at The Green Grid, a nonprofit industry consortium, developed a metric called Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE) to measure water usage by data centers. Similar to the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) metric, which measures the energy efficiency of a data center, the WUE metric assesses the efficiency of a data center\u2019s water use. WUE is reported in liters per kilowatt-hour (kWh): a data center\u2019s total water consumption, measured in liters, is divided by the total energy consumed by that data center in kilowatt-hours in the same time period. While \u201c0\u201d is the ideal WUE score, this can only be achieved in air-cooled data centers, and most data centers cannot meet this target due to their location\u2019s climate conditions. The average WUE across data centers is 1.9 liters per kWh, which is a great goal to beat.\nData centers' water usage depends on various factors, including location, climate, water availability, size, and IT rack chip densities. In hotter climates, like in the southwest United States, data centers need to use more water to cool the building and equipment. With the increasing number of centers supporting AI requests, chip density is also growing, which leads to higher room temperatures, necessitating the use of more water chillers at the server level to maintain cool temperatures.
