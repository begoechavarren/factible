This ... government and Democrats as a threat to democracy have ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nSince the 2016 election campaign, rhetoric from former President Donald Trump and MAGA Republicans in Congress has inspired right-wing domestic terrorists to violence. In this time, we have seen an uptick of extremists of all types willing to engage in political violence, we\u2019ve seen militia groups mobilized to violence for the 2020 election and we\u2019ve seen political violence continue throughout and beyond Trump\u2019s presidency.\nThis August, after the execution of a federal search warrant at Mar-a-Lago, violent rhetoric from the far-right escalated exponentially, including \u2013 shockingly \u2013 calls for civil war. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, warned that if former President Trump is prosecuted, there will be \u201criots in the streets.\u201d MAGA Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona compared the FBI to \u201cbrown shirts,\u201d a term used to describe Nazi storm troopers.\nSadly, public figures on the extreme right are crippling our efforts to curb this violence by attacking the rule of law and continuing to give extremists the go-ahead, either tacitly or expressly.\nIn January 2021, hours before the tragic January 6 attack on the US Capitol, Trump declared to his followers on the National Mall, \u201c[I]f you don\u2019t fight like hell, you\u2019re not going to have a country anymore.\u201d GOP Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama told Trump supporters that \u201c[t]oday is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass\u201d while telling the crowd that \u201cour ancestors sacrificed their blood, their sweat, their tears, their fortunes and sometimes their lives,\u201d before asking, \u201cAre you willing to do the same?\u201d And no one will forget GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri pumping his fist in solidarity as rioters assembled at the Capitol demanding the election be overturned.\nIn the aftermath of the attack, insurrectionists testified in court that they were only \u201cfollowing presidential orders,\u201d when they breached the Capitol and threatened the lives of all who work there.\nMake no mistake, the January 6 attack was not an isolated incident. I have followed the threat of domestic terrorism for nearly two decades, have watched it grow and have urged action to combat it. According to the Department of Homeland Security, it is the greatest terrorism threat to our homeland. And from what we\u2019ve seen after the 2020 election, it is also clearly a threat to the rule of law and our democracy.\nSince 2015, the year Trump declared his candidacy for president, there have been 333 domestic terrorism plots or attacks in the United States \u2013 an all-time high. Right-wing extremists have perpetrated 80% of those attacks, resulting in 91 tragic deaths.\nOur public spaces increasingly face violence. Mass shootings, hostage taking and other violent plots have reduced state capitols, grocery stores, schools, houses of worship, and concerts to crime scenes. Just last week, the federal government released a bulletin warning that there is a heightened threat to next week\u2019s midterm elections by a rise in violent domestic extremism.\nThis rise in domestic terrorism comes at a particularly dangerous moment for the country: A recent survey found that half of the country believes \u201cin the next few years, there will be civil war in the United States,\u201d and more than one in 10 Americans expressed their own willingness to commit political violence \u201cto threaten or intimidate\u201d others.\nAccording to experts at the University of Chicago, an estimated 13 million Americans believe force would be justified to restore Trump to the White House, and an estimated 15 million Americans would support using force to prevent the former president from being prosecuted. These startling numbers again underline that our safety and security \u2013 as well as the rule of law \u2013 are under attack.\nHaving spent nearly 30 years in Congress, including as Chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security and, since last year, the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the US Capitol, I know that not every Republican embraces the MAGA extremism that is turning many to violence. But I also know that MAGA Republicans, and their leader, are drowning out the voices of reason within their party while they erode American democracy. In fact, many on the right are all too willing to exploit this extremism \u2013 and resulting division \u2013 for political gain.\nTo understand how MAGA Republicans exploit their followers and dog-whistle at violence, look no further than their reaction to the FBI\u2019s execution of a lawful search warrant for highly classified documents apparently kept illegally at the former President\u2019s beach club. According to the wide breadth of public reporting, the Department of Justice followed the law and all normal procedures after attempting to obtain the classified documents voluntarily. Although no one is above the law in this country, Trump and MAGA extremist politicians\u2019 immediate reaction was to attack the rule of law and dog-whistle at violence.\nKnowing full well that MAGA extremists hang on their every word as marching orders, the former President and Republican leaders shamefully nodded toward violence after the execution of the Mar-a-Lago search warrant. The former President said he does \u201cnot believe the people will stand for it\u201d and said that if the temperature is not brought down in the country, which he has only dialed up, \u201cterrible things are going to happen.\u201d Extremist members of Congress have called for the FBI, the principal law enforcement agency of the United States, to be defunded.\nWhat ensued has been all too predictable. Twitter posts about \u201ccivil war\u201d rose nearly 3,000% in a matter of hours after the search. Federal law enforcement saw an increase in threats against their officers. A week later, an armed man attempted to breach an FBI office in Ohio before engaging in an hours-long standoff with police. The incident ended when the man pointed his firearm at police and was shot and killed.\nMembers of Congress have also been targeted, with one Democratic Congressman rep\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Is That What His Voters Want?\n\nGoogle Search Snippet:\n... government, though some extremists do embrace that, says Jonathan Zatlin, an associate professor of history at the College of Arts & Sciences.\n\nFull Page Content:\nSince the 2016 election campaign, rhetoric from former President Donald Trump and MAGA Republicans in Congress has inspired right-wing domestic terrorists to violence. In this time, we have seen an uptick of extremists of all types willing to engage in political violence, we\u2019ve seen militia groups mobilized to violence for the 2020 election and we\u2019ve seen political violence continue throughout and beyond Trump\u2019s presidency.\nThis August, after the execution of a federal search warrant at Mar-a-Lago, violent rhetoric from the far-right escalated exponentially, including \u2013 shockingly \u2013 calls for civil war. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, warned that if former President Trump is prosecuted, there will be \u201criots in the streets.\u201d MAGA Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona compared the FBI to \u201cbrown shirts,\u201d a term used to describe Nazi storm troopers.\nSadly, public figures on the extreme right are crippling our efforts to curb this violence by attacking the rule of law and continuing to give extremists the go-ahead, either tacitly or expressly.\nIn January 2021, hours before the tragic January 6 attack on the US Capitol, Trump declared to his followers on the National Mall, \u201c[I]f you don\u2019t fight like hell, you\u2019re not going to have a country anymore.\u201d GOP Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama told Trump supporters that \u201c[t]oday is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass\u201d while telling the crowd that \u201cour ancestors sacrificed their blood, their sweat, their tears, their fortunes and sometimes their lives,\u201d before asking, \u201cAre you willing to do the same?\u201d And no one will forget GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri pumping his fist in solidarity as rioters assembled at the Capitol demanding the election be overturned.\nIn the aftermath of the attack, insurrectionists testified in court that they were only \u201cfollowing presidential orders,\u201d when they breached the Capitol and threatened the lives of all who work there.\nMake no mistake, the January 6 attack was not an isolated incident. I have followed the threat of domestic terrorism for nearly two decades, have watched it grow and have urged action to combat it. According to the Department of Homeland Security, it is the greatest terrorism threat to our homeland. And from what we\u2019ve seen after the 2020 election, it is also clearly a threat to the rule of law and our democracy.\nSince 2015, the year Trump declared his candidacy for president, there have been 333 domestic terrorism plots or attacks in the United States \u2013 an all-time high. Right-wing extremists have perpetrated 80% of those attacks, resulting in 91 tragic deaths.\nOur public spaces increasingly face violence. Mass shootings, hostage taking and other violent plots have reduced state capitols, grocery stores, schools, houses of worship, and concerts to crime scenes. Just last week, the federal government released a bulletin warning that there is a heightened threat to next week\u2019s midterm elections by a rise in violent domestic extremism.\nThis rise in domestic terrorism comes at a particularly dangerous moment for the country: A recent survey found that half of the country believes \u201cin the next few years, there will be civil war in the United States,\u201d and more than one in 10 Americans expressed their own willingness to commit political violence \u201cto threaten or intimidate\u201d others.\nAccording to experts at the University of Chicago, an estimated 13 million Americans believe force would be justified to restore Trump to the White House, and an estimated 15 million Americans would support using force to prevent the former president from being prosecuted. These startling numbers again underline that our safety and security \u2013 as well as the rule of law \u2013 are under attack.\nHaving spent nearly 30 years in Congress, including as Chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security and, since last year, the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the US Capitol, I know that not every Republican embraces the MAGA extremism that is turning many to violence. But I also know that MAGA Republicans, and their leader, are drowning out the voices of reason within their party while they erode American democracy. In fact, many on the right are all too willing to exploit this extremism \u2013 and resulting division \u2013 for political gain.\nTo understand how MAGA Republicans exploit their followers and dog-whistle at violence, look no further than their reaction to the FBI\u2019s execution of a lawful search warrant for highly classified documents apparently kept illegally at the former President\u2019s beach club. According to the wide breadth of public reporting, the Department of Justice followed the law and all normal procedures after attempting to obtain the classified documents voluntarily. Although no one is above the law in this country, Trump and MAGA extremist politicians\u2019 immediate reaction was to attack the rule of law and dog-whistle at violence.\nKnowing full well that MAGA extremists hang on their every word as marching orders, the former President and Republican leaders shamefully nodded toward violence after the execution of the Mar-a-Lago search warrant. The former President said he does \u201cnot believe the people will stand for it\u201d and said that if the temperature is not brought down in the country, which he has only dialed up, \u201cterrible things are going to happen.\u201d Extremist members of Congress have called for the FBI, the principal law enforcement agency of the United States, to be defunded.\nWhat ensued has been all too predictable. Twitter posts about \u201ccivil war\u201d rose nearly 3,000% in a matter of hours after the search. Federal law enforcement saw an increase in threats against their officers. A week later, an armed man attempted to breach an FBI office in Ohio before engaging in an hours-long standoff with police. The incident ended when the man pointed his firearm at police and was shot and killed.\nMembers of Congress have also been targeted, with one Democratic Congressman rep\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",
