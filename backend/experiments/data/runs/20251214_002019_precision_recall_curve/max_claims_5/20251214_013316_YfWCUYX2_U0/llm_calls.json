We look at the Earth from space and we measure it on the ground. And what we see is that the planet's climate is changing. The last years have been the warmest since modern record-keeping began. It's serious. Even a little change in temperature can have big effects. And we're seeing some of those effects now. Sea levels are rising. We're seeing more extreme events like heatwaves and heavy rainfall and wildfire. And we know that a lot of those effects are going to increase with more warming. These changes are impacting decisions that some people make every day, like a farmer thinking about what crops to grow or a homeowner thinking about flood risk. But there's hope. There are scientists at NASA and around the world that are researching this. We know more about our planet than we have ever before, and we learn more every day. So we know why climate is changing. We know that it's due to increasing greenhouse gases from human activity. We also have tools that can help us better understand and better prepare for future climate change. So we develop computer models that help us understand how much it might change in the future. And we're also developing technologies here at NASA and around the world that can help us limit future warming or respond to the warming that we're experiencing. So why does climate change matter? It's real. It's serious, and it's here. We Asked a NASA Scientist. NASA. A NASA 360 Production.",

The total rise is equivalent to draining a quarter of Lake Superior into the ocean over the course of a year.\nThis NASA-led analysis is based on a sea level dataset featuring more than 30 years of satellite observations, starting with the U.S.-French TOPEX/Poseidon mission, which launched in 1992. The Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich mission, which launched in November 2020, is the latest in the series of satellites that have contributed to this sea level record.\nThe data shows that global average sea level has risen a total of about 4 inches (9.4 centimeters) since 1993. The rate of this increase has also accelerated, more than doubling from 0.07 inches (0.18 centimeters) per year in 1993 to the current rate of 0.17 inches (0.42 centimeters) per year.\n\u201cCurrent rates of acceleration mean that we are on track to add another 20 centimeters of global mean sea level by 2050, doubling the amount of change in the next three decades compared to the previous 100 years and increasing the frequency and impacts of floods across the world,\u201d said Nadya Vinogradova Shiffer, director for the NASA sea level change team and the ocean physics program in Washington.\nSeasonal Effects\nGlobal sea level saw a significant jump from 2022 to 2023 due mainly to a switch between La Ni\u00f1a and El Ni\u00f1o conditions. A mild La Ni\u00f1a from 2021 to 2022 resulted in a lower-than-expected rise in sea level that year. A strong El Ni\u00f1o developed in 2023, helping to boost the average amount of rise in sea surface height.\nLa Ni\u00f1a is characterized by cooler-than-normal ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. El Ni\u00f1o involves warmer-than-average ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific. Both periodic climate phenomena affect patterns of rainfall and snowfall as well as sea levels around the world.\n\u201cDuring La Ni\u00f1a, rain that normally falls in the ocean falls on the land instead, temporarily taking water out of the ocean and lowering sea levels,\u201d said Josh Willis, a sea level researcher at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \u201cIn El Ni\u00f1o years, a lot of the rain that normally falls on land ends up in the ocean, which raises sea levels temporarily.\u201d\nA Human Footprint\nSeasonal or periodic climate phenomena can affect global average sea level from year to year. But the underlying trend for more than three decades has been increasing ocean heights as a direct response to global warming due to the excessive heat trapped by greenhouse gases in Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\u201cLong-term datasets like this 30-year satellite record allow us to differentiate between short-term effects on sea level, like El Ni\u00f1o, and trends that let us know where sea level is heading,\u201d said Ben Hamlington, lead for NASA\u2019s sea level change team at JPL.\nThese multidecadal observations wouldn\u2019t be possible without ongoing international cooperation, as well as scientific and technical innovations by NASA and other space agencies. Specifically, radar altimeters have helped produce ever-more precise measurements of sea level around the world. To calculate ocean height, these instruments bounce microwave signals off the sea surface, recording the time the signal takes to travel from a satellite to Earth and back, as well as the strength of the return signal.\nThe researchers also periodically cross-check those sea level measurements against data from other sources. These include tide gauges, as well as satellite measurements of factors like atmospheric water vapor and Earth\u2019s gravity field that can affect the accuracy of sea level measurements. Using that information, the researchers recalibrated the 30-year dataset, resulting in updates to sea levels in some previous years. That includes a sea level rise increase of 0.08 inches (0.21 centimeters) from 2021 to 2022.\nWhen researchers combine space-based altimetry data of the oceans with more than a century of observations from surface-based sources, such as tide gauges, the information dramatically improves our understanding of how sea surface height is changing on a global scale. When these sea level measurements are combined with other information, including ocean temperature, ice loss, and land motion, scientists can decipher why and how seas are rising.\nSite Manager: Carmen Blackwood NASA Responsible Official: Doug Newman\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Such shifts can be natural, due to changes in the sun\u2019s activity or large volcanic eruptions. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.\nBurning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun\u2019s heat and raising temperatures.\nThe main greenhouse gases that are causing climate change include carbon dioxide and methane. These come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example. Clearing land and cutting down forests can also release carbon dioxide. Agriculture, oil and gas operations are major sources of methane emissions. Energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main sectors causing greenhouse gases.\nClimate scientists have showed that humans are responsible for virtually all global heating over the last 200 years. Human activities like the ones mentioned above are causing greenhouse gases that are warming the world faster than at any time in at least the last two thousand years.\nThe average temperature of the Earth\u2019s surface is now about 1.42\u00b0C warmer than it was in the late 1800s-prior to the industrial revolution-and warmer than at any time in the last 100,000 years. The last decade (2015-2024) was the warmest on record, and each of the last four decades has been warmer than any previous decade since 1850.\nMany people think that climate change mainly means warmer temperatures. But temperature rise is only the beginning of the story. Because the Earth is a system where everything is connected, changes in one area can influence changes in all others.\nThe consequences of climate change include, among others, intense droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice, catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.\nClimate change can affect our health, ability to grow food, housing, safety and work. Some of us are already more vulnerable to climate impacts, such as people living in small island nations and other developing countries. Conditions like sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion have advanced to the point where entire communities have had to relocate, while protracted droughts are putting people at risk of famine. In the future, the number of people displaced by weather-related events is expected to rise.\nIn a series of UN reports, thousands of scientists and government reviewers agreed that limiting global temperature rise to no more than 1.5\u00b0C would help us avoid the worst climate impacts and maintain a liveable climate. Yet policies currently in place point to up to 2.8\u00b0C of warming by the end of the century.\nThe emissions that cause climate change come from every part of the world and affect everyone, but some countries produce much more than others. The six biggest emitters (China, the United States of America, India, the European Union, the Russian Federation, and Indonesia) together account for more than half of all global greenhouse gas emissions. By contrast, the 45 least developed countries contribute only 3 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.\nEveryone must take climate action, but people and countries creating more of the problem have a greater responsibility to act first.\nMany climate change solutions can deliver economic benefits while improving our lives and protecting the environment. We also have global frameworks and agreements to guide progress, such as the Sustainable Development Goals, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. Three broad categories of action are: cutting emissions, adapting to climate impacts and financing required adjustments.\nSwitching energy systems from fossil fuels to renewables like solar or wind will reduce the emissions driving climate change. But we have to act now. While a growing number of countries is committing to net zero emissions by 2050, emissions must be cut in half by 2030 to keep warming below 1.5\u00b0C. Achieving this means huge declines in the use of coal, oil and gas: production and consumption of all fossil fuels need to be cut by at least 30 per cent by 2030 in order to prevent catastrophic levels of climate change.\nAdapting to climate consequences protects people, homes, businesses, livelihoods, infrastructure and natural ecosystems. It covers current impacts and those likely in the future. Adaptation will be required everywhere but must be prioritized now for the most vulnerable people with the fewest resources to cope with climate hazards. The rate of return can be high. Early warning systems for disasters, for instance, save lives and property, and can deliver benefits up to 10 times the initial cost.\nClimate action requires significant financial investments by governments and businesses. But climate inaction is vastly more expensive. One critical step is for developed countries to support developing countries so they can adapt and move towards greener economies.\nTo get familiar with some of the more technical terms used in connection with climate change, consult the Climate Dictionary.\nClimate change is a hot topic \u2013 with myths and falsehoods circulating widely.

And the likelihood of reaching such temperatures will continue to rise as the world warms, it said.\nAround the world, climate change has made countless heatwaves much more likely and more intense, the WWA says.\nExamples include 48C temperatures in Mali in April 2024 and prolonged, widespread heat in Scandinavia in July 2025, with temperatures regularly passing 30C in Norway.\nHeatwaves can happen as a result of heat domes, which are created when an area of high pressure stays over the same area for days or weeks, trapping hot air underneath.\nOne theory suggests that higher temperatures in the Arctic - which has warmed nearly four times faster than the global average - are affecting the fast band of winds high in the atmosphere known as the jet stream.\nThat could be making heat domes more likely, although this is not clear cut.\nFor every 1C rise in air temperature, the atmosphere can hold about 7% more moisture.\nWith more moisture available, rainfall can become heavier.\nBetween October 2023 and March 2024, the UK experienced the second-wettest such period on record.\nThis level of rainfall was made at least four times as likely by human-caused warming, according to the WWA.\nIn September 2024, deadly floods hit much of central Europe, including Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, Austria and Italy.\nThe intensity of the rainfall over four days in mid-September was made twice as likely by climate change, the WWA says.\nGlobally, heavy rainfall events have become more frequent and intense over most land regions due to human activity, according to the UN's climate body, the IPCC\nIt says this pattern will continue with further warming.\nVarious factors affect whether such heavy rainfall leads to flooding, including the quality of flood defences and drainage systems.\nLinking climate change with specific individual droughts can be difficult, because there are lots of different factors that affect the availability of water.\nNatural weather systems, for example, can play a key role, as was the case with drought in southern Africa in early 2024.\nBut climate change is shifting global rainfall patterns. While some of the world is getting wetter, other parts are becoming drier, which can make them more prone to drought.\nAnd heatwaves fuelled by climate change can worsen dry conditions when they do occur, by increasing evaporation from the soil.\nThis makes the air above warm up more quickly, leading to more intense heat.\nDuring periods of hot weather, increased demand for water, especially from farmers, puts even more stress on the water supply.\nIn parts of East Africa, there were five failed rainy seasons in a row between 2020 and 2022, as the region suffered its worst drought for 40 years. This displaced 1.2 million people in Somalia alone.\nClimate change has made droughts like this at least 100 times more likely, according to the WWA.\nHuman-caused warming was also the main driver of drought in the Amazon rainforest in the second half of 2023, the WWA found. This was the region's worst drought since modern records began.\nFires happen naturally in many parts of the world.\nIt is difficult to know if climate change has caused or worsened a specific wildfire because other factors are also relevant, such as changes to the way land is used.\nBut climate change is making the weather conditions needed for wildfires to spread more likely, the IPCC says.\nExtreme, long-lasting heat draws more moisture out of soils and vegetation.\nThese tinder-dry conditions provide fuel for fires, which can spread at an incredible speed, particularly if winds are strong.\nThe north-east Amazon experienced an extreme fire season in early 2024. Climate change made the weather conditions that helped the fires to spread between 30 and 70 times more likely, according to a report on the state of global wildfires.\nThat meant the burned area was about four times greater than if humans hadn't heated up the planet, the scientists found.\nMeanwhile, the burned area in the Southern California fires of January 2025 was about 25 times larger due to climate change, they estimated, although there are large uncertainties in the precise figures.\nMany fires are started deliberately or accidentally by humans. But rising temperatures may also increase the likelihood of lightning in the world's northernmost forests, which can in turn trigger more fires.\nThe combined effects of shifting land use and climate change mean extreme wildfires are projected to become more frequent and intense globally, according to the UN Environment Programme (UNEP).\nThe number of the most extreme fires may rise by up to 50% by 2100, UNEP suggests.\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

Climate change made the weather conditions that helped the fires to spread between 30 and 70 times more likely, according to a report on the state of global wildfires.\nThat meant the burned area was about four times greater than if humans hadn't heated up the planet, the scientists found.\nMeanwhile, the burned area in the Southern California fires of January 2025 was about 25 times larger due to climate change, they estimated, although there are large uncertainties in the precise figures.\nMany fires are started deliberately or accidentally by humans. But rising temperatures may also increase the likelihood of lightning in the world's northernmost forests, which can in turn trigger more fires.\nThe combined effects of shifting land use and climate change mean extreme wildfires are projected to become more frequent and intense globally, according to the UN Environment Programme (UNEP).\nThe number of the most extreme fires may rise by up to 50% by 2100, UNEP suggests.\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

Over the last century, burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nHuman activities are driving the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century.\nScientists attribute the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century to the human expansion of the \"greenhouse effect\"1 \u2014 warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth toward space.\nLife on Earth depends on energy coming from the Sun. About half the light energy reaching Earth's atmosphere passes through the air and clouds to the surface, where it is absorbed and radiated in the form of infrared heat. About 90% of this heat is then absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-radiated, slowing heat loss to space.\nA vital component of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide (CO2) is released through natural processes (like volcanic eruptions) and through human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation.\nLike many atmospheric gases, methane comes from both natural and human-caused sources. Methane comes from plant-matter breakdown in wetlands and is also released from landfills and rice farming. Livestock animals emit methane from their digestion and manure. Leaks from fossil fuel production and transportation are another major source of methane, and natural gas is 70% to 90% methane.\nA potent greenhouse gas produced by farming practices, nitrous oxide is released during commercial and organic fertilizer production and use. Nitrous oxide also comes from burning fossil fuels and burning vegetation and has increased by 18% in the last 100 years.\nThese chemical compounds do not exist in nature \u2013 they are entirely of industrial origin. They were used as refrigerants, solvents (a substance that dissolves others), and spray can propellants.\nFORCING: Something acting upon Earth's climate that causes a change in how energy flows through it (such as long-lasting, heat-trapping gases - also known as greenhouse gases). These gases slow outgoing heat in the atmosphere and cause the planet to warm.\nWater vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas, but because the warming ocean increases the amount of it in our atmosphere, it is not a direct cause of climate change. Credit: John Fowler on Unsplash\nFEEDBACKS: A process where something is either amplified or reduced as time goes on, such as water vapor increasing as Earth warms leading to even more warming.\nOver the last century, burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). This increase happens because the coal or oil burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the air to make CO2. To a lesser extent, clearing of land for agriculture, industry, and other human activities has increased concentrations of greenhouse gases.\nThe industrial activities that our modern civilization depends upon have raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels by nearly 50% since 17502. This increase is due to human activities, because scientists can see a distinctive isotopic fingerprint in the atmosphere.\nIn its Sixth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, composed of scientific experts from countries all over the world, concluded that it is unequivocal that the increase of CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere over the industrial era is the result of human activities and that human influence is the principal driver of many changes observed across the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nThe panel's AR6 Working Group I (WGI) Summary for Policymakers report is online at https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/.\nScientists use a metric called Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) to measure the changes in energy the Earth receives from the Sun. TSI incorporates the 11-year solar cycle and solar flares/storms from the Sun's surface.\nStudies show that solar variability has played a role in past climate changes. For example, a decrease in solar activity coupled with increased volcanic activity helped trigger the Little Ice Age.\nBut several lines of evidence show that current global warming cannot be explained by changes in energy from the Sun:\n1.

Such shifts can be natural, due to changes in the sun\u2019s activity or large volcanic eruptions. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.\nBurning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun\u2019s heat and raising temperatures.\nThe main greenhouse gases that are causing climate change include carbon dioxide and methane. These come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example. Clearing land and cutting down forests can also release carbon dioxide. Agriculture, oil and gas operations are major sources of methane emissions. Energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main sectors causing greenhouse gases.\nClimate scientists have showed that humans are responsible for virtually all global heating over the last 200 years. Human activities like the ones mentioned above are causing greenhouse gases that are warming the world faster than at any time in at least the last two thousand years.\nThe average temperature of the Earth\u2019s surface is now about 1.42\u00b0C warmer than it was in the late 1800s-prior to the industrial revolution-and warmer than at any time in the last 100,000 years. The last decade (2015-2024) was the warmest on record, and each of the last four decades has been warmer than any previous decade since 1850.\nMany people think that climate change mainly means warmer temperatures. But temperature rise is only the beginning of the story. Because the Earth is a system where everything is connected, changes in one area can influence changes in all others.\nThe consequences of climate change include, among others, intense droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice, catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.\nClimate change can affect our health, ability to grow food, housing, safety and work. Some of us are already more vulnerable to climate impacts, such as people living in small island nations and other developing countries. Conditions like sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion have advanced to the point where entire communities have had to relocate, while protracted droughts are putting people at risk of famine. In the future, the number of people displaced by weather-related events is expected to rise.\nIn a series of UN reports, thousands of scientists and government reviewers agreed that limiting global temperature rise to no more than 1.5\u00b0C would help us avoid the worst climate impacts and maintain a liveable climate. Yet policies currently in place point to up to 2.8\u00b0C of warming by the end of the century.\nThe emissions that cause climate change come from every part of the world and affect everyone, but some countries produce much more than others. The six biggest emitters (China, the United States of America, India, the European Union, the Russian Federation, and Indonesia) together account for more than half of all global greenhouse gas emissions. By contrast, the 45 least developed countries contribute only 3 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.\nEveryone must take climate action, but people and countries creating more of the problem have a greater responsibility to act first.\nMany climate change solutions can deliver economic benefits while improving our lives and protecting the environment. We also have global frameworks and agreements to guide progress, such as the Sustainable Development Goals, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. Three broad categories of action are: cutting emissions, adapting to climate impacts and financing required adjustments.\nSwitching energy systems from fossil fuels to renewables like solar or wind will reduce the emissions driving climate change. But we have to act now. While a growing number of countries is committing to net zero emissions by 2050, emissions must be cut in half by 2030 to keep warming below 1.5\u00b0C. Achieving this means huge declines in the use of coal, oil and gas: production and consumption of all fossil fuels need to be cut by at least 30 per cent by 2030 in order to prevent catastrophic levels of climate change.\nAdapting to climate consequences protects people, homes, businesses, livelihoods, infrastructure and natural ecosystems. It covers current impacts and those likely in the future. Adaptation will be required everywhere but must be prioritized now for the most vulnerable people with the fewest resources to cope with climate hazards. The rate of return can be high. Early warning systems for disasters, for instance, save lives and property, and can deliver benefits up to 10 times the initial cost.\nClimate action requires significant financial investments by governments and businesses.

The following is our report on global mean temperature during 2024.\nWe conclude that 2024 was the warmest year on Earth since 1850, exceeding the previous record just set in 2023 by a clear and definitive margin. This period, since 1850, is the time when sufficient direct measurements from thermometers exist to create a purely instrumental estimate of changes in global mean temperature.\nThe last ten years have included all ten of the warmest years observed in the instrumental record.\nThe warming spike observed in 2023 and 2024 has been extreme and represents a larger than expected deviation from the previous warming trend. The spike has multiple causes, including both natural variability and man-made global warming from the accumulation of greenhouses gases; however, as discussed below, we believe additional factors are needed to explain the full magnitude of this event. Reductions in low cloud cover and man-made sulfur aerosol pollution are likely to have played a significant additional role in recent warming.\nOver the previous 50 years, global warming has preceded in an almost linear fashion, consistent with an almost linear increase in the total greenhouse gas forcing. The warming spike in 2023/2024 suggests that the past warming rate is no longer a reliable predictor of the future, and additional factors have created conditions for faster warming, at least in the short-term.\nThe global annual average for 2024 in our dataset is estimated as 1.62 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b0C (2.91 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b0F) above the average during the period 1850 to 1900, which is traditionally used a reference for the pre-industrial period. This is first time Berkeley Earth has reported an annual average above 1.6 \u00b0C (2.9 \u00b0F), and the only second time that Berkeley Earth has reported any year exceeding the key 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) threshold, after slightly doing so in 2023. Due to uncertainties and differences in methodologies, other groups are expected to report 2024 as slightly cooler. The ECMWF\u2019s Copernicus research service joins us in just barely exceeding 1.6 \u00b0C (2.9 \u00b0F), while other groups are somewhat cooler. The differences between Berkeley Earth\u2019s analysis and that of other groups is discussed at the end of this report.\nA goal of keeping global warming to no more than 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) above pre-industrial has been an intense focus of international attention. This goal is defined based on multi-decadal averages, and so a single year above 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) does not directly constitute a failure. However, recent warming trends and the lack of adequate mitigation measures make it clear that the 1.5 \u00b0C goal will not be met. The long-term average of global temperature is likely to effectively cross the 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) threshold in the next 5-10 years. While the 1.5 \u00b0C goal will not be met, urgent action is still needed to limit man-made climate change. Each increment of additional warming, e.g. 1.6 \u00b0C, 1.7 \u00b0C, etc., will lead to additional and compounding climate change impacts that can still be avoided if effective mitigation steps are made to reduce man-made greenhouse gas emissions.\nDuring 2024, 24% of the Earth\u2019s surface had a locally record warm annual average, including 32% of land areas and 21% of ocean areas. These areas coincided with a number of major population centers. We estimate that 3.3 billion people \u2014 40% of Earth\u2019s population \u2014 experienced a locally record warm annual average in 2024. This includes 2/3 of the population of China, and a majority of the populations of Brazil, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Mexico, 1/3 of the United States, and much of South and Central America, and Eastern Europe.\nNone of the Earth\u2019s surface had a record cold annual average in 2024.\nDue to natural cooling patterns that have recently begun in the oceans, it is expected that 2025 will be moderately cooler than 2024. The most likely outcome is that 2025 ranks as roughly the 3rd warmest year since 1850, though warmer or cooler outcomes are also possible.\nIn addition, 2024 was notable for:\nIn Berkeley Earth\u2019s analysis the global mean temperature in 2023 is estimated to have been 1.62 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b0C (2.91 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b0F) above the average temperature from 1850-1900, a period often used as a pre-industrial baseline for global temperature targets. This is ~0.08 \u00b0C (~0.14 \u00b0F) warmer than the previous record high observed in 2023. As a result, 2024 is the warmest year to have been directly observed using thermometer measurements, and stands out well-above all previous years.\nThough the availability of thermometers limits direct measurements to the period since 1850, indirect evidence suggests that the Earth is currently at its warmest global average temperature for at least several thousand of years, and possibly the warmest since the last interglacial ~120,000 years ago.\nThe abrupt increase in temperatures from 2022 to 2024 is the largest two year increase since the 1870s.\nThis is the second time in Berkeley Earth\u2019s analysis that an annual average temperature has exceeded the pre-industrial baseline period by more than 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F), having previously done so by a small margin in 2023. It is the first time that an annual average has exceeded 1.6 \u00b0C (2.9 \u00b0F) in our analysis. As discussed at the end of this report, other research groups have slightly different estimates, some of which also cross these thresholds and others are slightly cooler.\nUnder the Paris Agreement, many countries have set an aspirational goal of limiting long-term global warming to no more than 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F). That target is based on the state of the climate averaged over many years, so it is not automatically considered to have been breached by one or two years exceeding 1.5 \u00b0C of warming. However, it is clear that this 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) threshold is no longer avoidable and the long-term average of global warming will likely cross this threshold\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

When the new century started in 2000, the ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nBerkeley Earth, a California-based non-profit research organization, has been preparing independent analyses of global mean temperature changes since 2013. The following is our report on global mean temperature during 2024.\nWe conclude that 2024 was the warmest year on Earth since 1850, exceeding the previous record just set in 2023 by a clear and definitive margin. This period, since 1850, is the time when sufficient direct measurements from thermometers exist to create a purely instrumental estimate of changes in global mean temperature.\nThe last ten years have included all ten of the warmest years observed in the instrumental record.\nThe warming spike observed in 2023 and 2024 has been extreme and represents a larger than expected deviation from the previous warming trend. The spike has multiple causes, including both natural variability and man-made global warming from the accumulation of greenhouses gases; however, as discussed below, we believe additional factors are needed to explain the full magnitude of this event. Reductions in low cloud cover and man-made sulfur aerosol pollution are likely to have played a significant additional role in recent warming.\nOver the previous 50 years, global warming has preceded in an almost linear fashion, consistent with an almost linear increase in the total greenhouse gas forcing. The warming spike in 2023/2024 suggests that the past warming rate is no longer a reliable predictor of the future, and additional factors have created conditions for faster warming, at least in the short-term.\nThe global annual average for 2024 in our dataset is estimated as 1.62 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b0C (2.91 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b0F) above the average during the period 1850 to 1900, which is traditionally used a reference for the pre-industrial period. This is first time Berkeley Earth has reported an annual average above 1.6 \u00b0C (2.9 \u00b0F), and the only second time that Berkeley Earth has reported any year exceeding the key 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) threshold, after slightly doing so in 2023. Due to uncertainties and differences in methodologies, other groups are expected to report 2024 as slightly cooler. The ECMWF\u2019s Copernicus research service joins us in just barely exceeding 1.6 \u00b0C (2.9 \u00b0F), while other groups are somewhat cooler. The differences between Berkeley Earth\u2019s analysis and that of other groups is discussed at the end of this report.\nA goal of keeping global warming to no more than 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) above pre-industrial has been an intense focus of international attention. This goal is defined based on multi-decadal averages, and so a single year above 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) does not directly constitute a failure. However, recent warming trends and the lack of adequate mitigation measures make it clear that the 1.5 \u00b0C goal will not be met. The long-term average of global temperature is likely to effectively cross the 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) threshold in the next 5-10 years. While the 1.5 \u00b0C goal will not be met, urgent action is still needed to limit man-made climate change. Each increment of additional warming, e.g. 1.6 \u00b0C, 1.7 \u00b0C, etc., will lead to additional and compounding climate change impacts that can still be avoided if effective mitigation steps are made to reduce man-made greenhouse gas emissions.\nDuring 2024, 24% of the Earth\u2019s surface had a locally record warm annual average, including 32% of land areas and 21% of ocean areas. These areas coincided with a number of major population centers. We estimate that 3.3 billion people \u2014 40% of Earth\u2019s population \u2014 experienced a locally record warm annual average in 2024. This includes 2/3 of the population of China, and a majority of the populations of Brazil, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Mexico, 1/3 of the United States, and much of South and Central America, and Eastern Europe.\nNone of the Earth\u2019s surface had a record cold annual average in 2024.\nDue to natural cooling patterns that have recently begun in the oceans, it is expected that 2025 will be moderately cooler than 2024. The most likely outcome is that 2025 ranks as roughly the 3rd warmest year since 1850, though warmer or cooler outcomes are also possible.\nIn addition, 2024 was notable for:\nIn Berkeley Earth\u2019s analysis the global mean temperature in 2023 is estimated to have been 1.62 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b0C (2.91 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b0F) above the average temperature from 1850-1900, a period often used as a pre-industrial baseline for global temperature targets. This is ~0.08 \u00b0C (~0.14 \u00b0F) warmer than the previous record high observed in 2023. As a result, 2024 is the warmest year to have been directly observed using thermometer measurements, and stands out well-above all previous years.\nThough the availability of thermometers limits direct measurements to the period since 1850, indirect evidence suggests that the Earth is currently at its warmest global average temperature for at least several thousand of years, and possibly the warmest since the last interglacial ~120,000 years ago.\nThe abrupt increase in temperatures from 2022 to 2024 is the largest two year increase since the 1870s.\nThis is the second time in Berkeley Earth\u2019s analysis that an annual average temperature has exceeded the pre-industrial baseline period by more than 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F), having previously done so by a small margin in 2023. It is the first time that an annual average has exceeded 1.6 \u00b0C (2.9 \u00b0F) in our analysis. As discussed at the end of this report, other research groups have slightly different estimates, some of which also cross these thresholds and others are slightly cooler.\nUnder the Paris Agreement, many countries have set an aspirational goal of limiting long-term global warming to no more than 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F). That target is based on the state of the climate averaged over many years, so it is not automatically considered to have been breached by one or two years exceeding 1.5 \u00b0C of warming. However, it is clear that this 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) threshold is no longer avoidable and the long-term average of global warming will likely cross this threshold\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Lee, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory\nSea level rise is affecting coastal communities around the world, especially those like Honolulu, pictured, that are located on islands\nCredit: NOAA Teacher at Sea Program, NOAA Ship HI\u2019IALAKAI\nA long-term sea level dataset shows ocean surface heights continuing to rise at faster and faster rates over decades of observations.\nGlobal average sea level rose by about 0.3 inches (0.76 centimeters) from 2022 to 2023, a relatively large jump due mostly to a warming climate and the development of a strong El Ni\u00f1o. The total rise is equivalent to draining a quarter of Lake Superior into the ocean over the course of a year.\nThis NASA-led analysis is based on a sea level dataset featuring more than 30 years of satellite observations, starting with the U.S.-French TOPEX/Poseidon mission, which launched in 1992. The Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich mission, which launched in November 2020, is the latest in the series of satellites that have contributed to this sea level record.\nThe data shows that global average sea level has risen a total of about 4 inches (9.4 centimeters) since 1993. The rate of this increase has also accelerated, more than doubling from 0.07 inches (0.18 centimeters) per year in 1993 to the current rate of 0.17 inches (0.42 centimeters) per year.\n\u201cCurrent rates of acceleration mean that we are on track to add another 20 centimeters of global mean sea level by 2050, doubling the amount of change in the next three decades compared to the previous 100 years and increasing the frequency and impacts of floods across the world,\u201d said Nadya Vinogradova Shiffer, director for the NASA sea level change team and the ocean physics program in Washington.\nSeasonal Effects\nGlobal sea level saw a significant jump from 2022 to 2023 due mainly to a switch between La Ni\u00f1a and El Ni\u00f1o conditions. A mild La Ni\u00f1a from 2021 to 2022 resulted in a lower-than-expected rise in sea level that year. A strong El Ni\u00f1o developed in 2023, helping to boost the average amount of rise in sea surface height.\nLa Ni\u00f1a is characterized by cooler-than-normal ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. El Ni\u00f1o involves warmer-than-average ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific. Both periodic climate phenomena affect patterns of rainfall and snowfall as well as sea levels around the world.\n\u201cDuring La Ni\u00f1a, rain that normally falls in the ocean falls on the land instead, temporarily taking water out of the ocean and lowering sea levels,\u201d said Josh Willis, a sea level researcher at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \u201cIn El Ni\u00f1o years, a lot of the rain that normally falls on land ends up in the ocean, which raises sea levels temporarily.\u201d\nA Human Footprint\nSeasonal or periodic climate phenomena can affect global average sea level from year to year. But the underlying trend for more than three decades has been increasing ocean heights as a direct response to global warming due to the excessive heat trapped by greenhouse gases in Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\u201cLong-term datasets like this 30-year satellite record allow us to differentiate between short-term effects on sea level, like El Ni\u00f1o, and trends that let us know where sea level is heading,\u201d said Ben Hamlington, lead for NASA\u2019s sea level change team at JPL.\nThese multidecadal observations wouldn\u2019t be possible without ongoing international cooperation, as well as scientific and technical innovations by NASA and other space agencies. Specifically, radar altimeters have helped produce ever-more precise measurements of sea level around the world. To calculate ocean height, these instruments bounce microwave signals off the sea surface, recording the time the signal takes to travel from a satellite to Earth and back, as well as the strength of the return signal.\nThe researchers also periodically cross-check those sea level measurements against data from other sources. These include tide gauges, as well as satellite measurements of factors like atmospheric water vapor and Earth\u2019s gravity field that can affect the accuracy of sea level measurements. Using that information, the researchers recalibrated the 30-year dataset, resulting in updates to sea levels in some previous years. That includes a sea level rise increase of 0.08 inches (0.21 centimeters) from 2021 to 2022.\nWhen researchers combine space-based altimetry data of the oceans with more than a century of observations from surface-based sources, such as tide gauges, the information dramatically improves our understanding of how sea surface height is changing on a global scale. When these sea level measurements are combined with other information, including ocean temperature, ice loss, and land motion, scientists can decipher why and how seas are rising.\nSite Manager: Carmen Blackwood NASA Responsible Official: Doug Newman\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The following is our report on global mean temperature during 2024.\nWe conclude that 2024 was the warmest year on Earth since 1850, exceeding the previous record just set in 2023 by a clear and definitive margin. This period, since 1850, is the time when sufficient direct measurements from thermometers exist to create a purely instrumental estimate of changes in global mean temperature.\nThe last ten years have included all ten of the warmest years observed in the instrumental record.\nThe warming spike observed in 2023 and 2024 has been extreme and represents a larger than expected deviation from the previous warming trend. The spike has multiple causes, including both natural variability and man-made global warming from the accumulation of greenhouses gases; however, as discussed below, we believe additional factors are needed to explain the full magnitude of this event. Reductions in low cloud cover and man-made sulfur aerosol pollution are likely to have played a significant additional role in recent warming.\nOver the previous 50 years, global warming has preceded in an almost linear fashion, consistent with an almost linear increase in the total greenhouse gas forcing. The warming spike in 2023/2024 suggests that the past warming rate is no longer a reliable predictor of the future, and additional factors have created conditions for faster warming, at least in the short-term.\nThe global annual average for 2024 in our dataset is estimated as 1.62 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b0C (2.91 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b0F) above the average during the period 1850 to 1900, which is traditionally used a reference for the pre-industrial period. This is first time Berkeley Earth has reported an annual average above 1.6 \u00b0C (2.9 \u00b0F), and the only second time that Berkeley Earth has reported any year exceeding the key 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) threshold, after slightly doing so in 2023. Due to uncertainties and differences in methodologies, other groups are expected to report 2024 as slightly cooler. The ECMWF\u2019s Copernicus research service joins us in just barely exceeding 1.6 \u00b0C (2.9 \u00b0F), while other groups are somewhat cooler. The differences between Berkeley Earth\u2019s analysis and that of other groups is discussed at the end of this report.\nA goal of keeping global warming to no more than 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) above pre-industrial has been an intense focus of international attention. This goal is defined based on multi-decadal averages, and so a single year above 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) does not directly constitute a failure. However, recent warming trends and the lack of adequate mitigation measures make it clear that the 1.5 \u00b0C goal will not be met. The long-term average of global temperature is likely to effectively cross the 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) threshold in the next 5-10 years. While the 1.5 \u00b0C goal will not be met, urgent action is still needed to limit man-made climate change. Each increment of additional warming, e.g. 1.6 \u00b0C, 1.7 \u00b0C, etc., will lead to additional and compounding climate change impacts that can still be avoided if effective mitigation steps are made to reduce man-made greenhouse gas emissions.\nDuring 2024, 24% of the Earth\u2019s surface had a locally record warm annual average, including 32% of land areas and 21% of ocean areas. These areas coincided with a number of major population centers. We estimate that 3.3 billion people \u2014 40% of Earth\u2019s population \u2014 experienced a locally record warm annual average in 2024. This includes 2/3 of the population of China, and a majority of the populations of Brazil, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Mexico, 1/3 of the United States, and much of South and Central America, and Eastern Europe.\nNone of the Earth\u2019s surface had a record cold annual average in 2024.\nDue to natural cooling patterns that have recently begun in the oceans, it is expected that 2025 will be moderately cooler than 2024. The most likely outcome is that 2025 ranks as roughly the 3rd warmest year since 1850, though warmer or cooler outcomes are also possible.\nIn addition, 2024 was notable for:\nIn Berkeley Earth\u2019s analysis the global mean temperature in 2023 is estimated to have been 1.62 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b0C (2.91 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b0F) above the average temperature from 1850-1900, a period often used as a pre-industrial baseline for global temperature targets. This is ~0.08 \u00b0C (~0.14 \u00b0F) warmer than the previous record high observed in 2023. As a result, 2024 is the warmest year to have been directly observed using thermometer measurements, and stands out well-above all previous years.\nThough the availability of thermometers limits direct measurements to the period since 1850, indirect evidence suggests that the Earth is currently at its warmest global average temperature for at least several thousand of years, and possibly the warmest since the last interglacial ~120,000 years ago.\nThe abrupt increase in temperatures from 2022 to 2024 is the largest two year increase since the 1870s.\nThis is the second time in Berkeley Earth\u2019s analysis that an annual average temperature has exceeded the pre-industrial baseline period by more than 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F), having previously done so by a small margin in 2023. It is the first time that an annual average has exceeded 1.6 \u00b0C (2.9 \u00b0F) in our analysis. As discussed at the end of this report, other research groups have slightly different estimates, some of which also cross these thresholds and others are slightly cooler.\nUnder the Paris Agreement, many countries have set an aspirational goal of limiting long-term global warming to no more than 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F). That target is based on the state of the climate averaged over many years, so it is not automatically considered to have been breached by one or two years exceeding 1.5 \u00b0C of warming. However, it is clear that this 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) threshold is no longer avoidable and the long-term average of global warming will likely cross this threshold\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Drought conditions persist \u00b7 5.\n\nFull Page Content:\nEarthjustice is scaling up to meet this unprecedented moment, and we need your support.\nOUR STORIES\nJuly 28, 2025\nCarbon pollution is contributing to climate disasters that will only get worse unless we take action.\nAcross the globe, extreme weather is becoming the new normal.\nFrom season to season and year to year, weather events that were once rare occurrences are now increasingly commonplace.\nHuman activity is causing rapid changes to our global climate that are contributing to extreme weather conditions.\nWhen fossil fuels are burned for electricity, heat, and transportation, carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that traps solar radiation, is released into our atmosphere.\nOver the past century, massive increases in carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gas emissions have caused the temperature on our planet to rise. That spike in global temperatures is fueling climate disasters that will only get worse unless we take action. Experts warn that we are running out of time to dramatically cut pollution to avoid climate catastrophe.\nRead on to learn more, find out what Earthjustice is doing to help the planet change course, and how you can help.\nStorm systems draw their energy from warm ocean water\nHurricanes are growing more powerful as global temperatures rise because these storm systems draw their energy from warm ocean water.\nIn September 2024, Hurricane Helene caused historic flooding across the Southeast United States, killing at least 121 people and leaving millions without power. Earlier in the summer, the Gulf Coast endured Hurricane Beryl, the earliest category 5 hurricane on record, fueled by exceptionally warm ocean waters.\nScientists warn that as our climate warms, storms will not only become stronger, but they will intensify faster.\nLarger fires in hot, dry years\nWildfires have always been a natural part of life in the western United States and Canada. However, as this region grows hotter and drier, wildfires are growing in size, ferocity, and speed.\nThe hazardous air pollution that wildfire smoke creates can spread far beyond the region burned. In summer 2023, smoke wafting down from nearly 900 wildfires tearing through Canada triggered air quality alerts that affected as many as 70 million people across the eastern United States.\nAnd then there\u2019s the destruction on the ground.\nIn recent years, California has been particulary prone to devastating blazes. With record dry, hot conditions across the state, seasonal high winds (known as Diablo in Northern California and Santa Ana in the southern part of the state) caused wildfires to grow and spread at an unprecedented rate.\nHeat waves pose health risks and strain our energy system\nAs global temperatures rise, the hottest temperatures \u2014 and the number of areas impacted by extreme heat \u2014 are also rising. That means more scorching hot days in more places.\nIn California\u2019s Death Valley this July, thermometers neared the hottest temperature ever recorded, hovering around 130 degrees. That same month, the average global temperature hit an all-time high.\nIt\u2019s not just that individual hot days are breaking records \u2014 there\u2019s an overall warming trend. Take the Texas cities of Austin and Houston, for example. Over the past 50 years, Austin has seen the number of days with temperatures above 100\u00b0F increase by one month, while Houston has recorded an additional month with temperatures above 95\u00b0F. In in the past century.\nMoisture evaporates from waterbodies and soil\nHigher temperatures also lead to drier conditions. When global temperatures rise, moisture evaporates from waterbodies and soil.\nDroughts in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world have become more severe and long-lasting thanks to climate change.\nIn fact, the American West is currently in the midst of a mega drought that ranks among the worst in the past 1,200 years, even after heavy rainfall in 2023. Much of the region is currently facing \"extreme\" or \"exceptional\" drought conditions.\nAreas that have historically trended toward heavy precipitation will get wetter\nWarmer air increases evaporation, which means that our atmosphere contains an increasing amount of water vapor for storms to sweep up and turn into rain or snow.\nJust as drier areas are likely to get drier with rising global temperatures, those areas of the world that have historically trended toward heavy precipitation will only get wetter.\nAt least 137 people died in Texas in July 2025 due to storms that dumped an amount of water greater than the daily flow of Niagara Falls in just a few hours, raising the Guadalupe River by more than 20 feet.\nThough it is difficult to determine with certainty whether climate change caused any specific weather event, scientists say that global warming will make storms like this one more common. New rain estimates issued in 2023 indicate that 12.6 million properties across the U.S. that were not previously thought to be at flood risk now are due to the increased likelihood of extreme precipitation events.\nOceans are warming; land ice is melting\nAs the planet warms, ocean waters are also warming \u2014 and expanding. At the same time, warmer temperatures are causing land ice \u2014 think glaciers and ice caps \u2014 to melt, which is adding water to the world\u2019s oceans.\nAs a result, average global sea level has increased eight inches in the last 150 years.\nThe Atlantic coast of the United States and the Gulf of Mexico are experiencing some of the highest sea level rise in the world, which, combined with record rainfall, has led to catastrophic flooding.\nTrapped water vapor leads to heavier snowfall\nEven as climate change raises average global temperatures, that doesn\u2019t spell the end of winters. Overall, winters are getting milder and shorter; but recent winters have brought intense snowstorms and record-breaking frost.\nAs a result, average global sea level has increased eight inches in the last 150 years.\nWhile it may seem contradictory, climate change may be contributing to more extreme winter weather\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Specifically, radar altimeters have helped produce ever-more precise measurements of sea level around the world. To calculate ocean height, these instruments bounce microwave signals off the sea surface, recording the time the signal takes to travel from a satellite to Earth and back, as well as the strength of the return signal.\nThe researchers also periodically cross-check those sea level measurements against data from other sources.

Human and Natural Causes - NRDC\n\nGoogle Search Snippet:\nHuman-driven causes of climate change: Transportation, Electricity generation, Industry & manufacturing, Agriculture, Oil & gas development, Buildings, ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nHuman activities are driving the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century.\nScientists attribute the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century to the human expansion of the \"greenhouse effect\"1 \u2014 warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth toward space.\nLife on Earth depends on energy coming from the Sun. About half the light energy reaching Earth's atmosphere passes through the air and clouds to the surface, where it is absorbed and radiated in the form of infrared heat. About 90% of this heat is then absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-radiated, slowing heat loss to space.\nA vital component of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide (CO2) is released through natural processes (like volcanic eruptions) and through human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation.\nLike many atmospheric gases, methane comes from both natural and human-caused sources. Methane comes from plant-matter breakdown in wetlands and is also released from landfills and rice farming. Livestock animals emit methane from their digestion and manure. Leaks from fossil fuel production and transportation are another major source of methane, and natural gas is 70% to 90% methane.\nA potent greenhouse gas produced by farming practices, nitrous oxide is released during commercial and organic fertilizer production and use. Nitrous oxide also comes from burning fossil fuels and burning vegetation and has increased by 18% in the last 100 years.\nThese chemical compounds do not exist in nature \u2013 they are entirely of industrial origin. They were used as refrigerants, solvents (a substance that dissolves others), and spray can propellants.\nFORCING: Something acting upon Earth's climate that causes a change in how energy flows through it (such as long-lasting, heat-trapping gases - also known as greenhouse gases). These gases slow outgoing heat in the atmosphere and cause the planet to warm.\nWater vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas, but because the warming ocean increases the amount of it in our atmosphere, it is not a direct cause of climate change. Credit: John Fowler on Unsplash\nFEEDBACKS: A process where something is either amplified or reduced as time goes on, such as water vapor increasing as Earth warms leading to even more warming.\nOver the last century, burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). This increase happens because the coal or oil burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the air to make CO2. To a lesser extent, clearing of land for agriculture, industry, and other human activities has increased concentrations of greenhouse gases.\nThe industrial activities that our modern civilization depends upon have raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels by nearly 50% since 17502. This increase is due to human activities, because scientists can see a distinctive isotopic fingerprint in the atmosphere.\nIn its Sixth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, composed of scientific experts from countries all over the world, concluded that it is unequivocal that the increase of CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere over the industrial era is the result of human activities and that human influence is the principal driver of many changes observed across the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nThe panel's AR6 Working Group I (WGI) Summary for Policymakers report is online at https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/.\nScientists use a metric called Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) to measure the changes in energy the Earth receives from the Sun. TSI incorporates the 11-year solar cycle and solar flares/storms from the Sun's surface.\nStudies show that solar variability has played a role in past climate changes. For example, a decrease in solar activity coupled with increased volcanic activity helped trigger the Little Ice Age.\nBut several lines of evidence show that current global warming cannot be explained by changes in energy from the Sun:\n1.

Record-breaking heat waves on land and in the ocean, drenching rains, severe floods, years-long droughts, extreme wildfires, and widespread flooding during hurricanes are all becoming more frequent and more intense.\nHuman actions since the Industrial Revolution, primarily the burning of fossil fuels, have caused greenhouse gases to rapidly rise in the atmosphere. As carbon dioxide, methane, and other gases increase, they act as a blanket, trapping heat and warming the planet. In response, Earth\u2019s air and ocean temperatures warm. This warming affects the water cycle, shifts weather patterns, and melts land ice \u2014 all impacts that can make extreme weather worse.\nAccording to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\u2019s Sixth Assessment Report released in 2021, the human-caused rise in greenhouse gases has increased the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. NASA\u2019s satellite missions, including the upcoming Earth System Observatory, provide vital data for monitoring and responding to extreme weather events.\nResearch says all the risks from these extreme weather events will escalate the more the planet warms. However, IPCC\u2019s Sixth Assessment Report also describes some climate change mitigation strategies, technological developments, and methods for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\nScientists use a combination of climate models (simulations) and land, air, sea, and space-based observations to research how extreme weather events change over time. First, scientists examine historical records to determine the frequency and intensity of past events. Many of these long-term records date back to the 1950s, though some start in the 1800s. Then scientists use climate models to see if the number or strength of these events is changing, or will change, due to increasing greenhouse gases when compared to what has happened historically.\nREAD MORE\nIPCC Assessment Report 6 \u2013 Working Group I \u2013 Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis\nIPCC Assessment Report 6 \u2013 Working Group II \u2013 Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability\nIPCC Assessment Report 6 \u2013 Working Group III \u2013 Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change\nNASA Global Climate Change - Mitigation and Adaptation\nNASA Global Climate Change - Extreme Makeover: Human Activities Are Making Some Extreme Events More Frequent or Intense\nHeader image is of a corn field impacted by drought in Texas on December 1, 2016.

The following is our report on global mean temperature during 2024.\nWe conclude that 2024 was the warmest year on Earth since 1850, exceeding the previous record just set in 2023 by a clear and definitive margin. This period, since 1850, is the time when sufficient direct measurements from thermometers exist to create a purely instrumental estimate of changes in global mean temperature.\nThe last ten years have included all ten of the warmest years observed in the instrumental record.\nThe warming spike observed in 2023 and 2024 has been extreme and represents a larger than expected deviation from the previous warming trend. The spike has multiple causes, including both natural variability and man-made global warming from the accumulation of greenhouses gases; however, as discussed below, we believe additional factors are needed to explain the full magnitude of this event. Reductions in low cloud cover and man-made sulfur aerosol pollution are likely to have played a significant additional role in recent warming.\nOver the previous 50 years, global warming has preceded in an almost linear fashion, consistent with an almost linear increase in the total greenhouse gas forcing. The warming spike in 2023/2024 suggests that the past warming rate is no longer a reliable predictor of the future, and additional factors have created conditions for faster warming, at least in the short-term.\nThe global annual average for 2024 in our dataset is estimated as 1.62 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b0C (2.91 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b0F) above the average during the period 1850 to 1900, which is traditionally used a reference for the pre-industrial period. This is first time Berkeley Earth has reported an annual average above 1.6 \u00b0C (2.9 \u00b0F), and the only second time that Berkeley Earth has reported any year exceeding the key 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) threshold, after slightly doing so in 2023. Due to uncertainties and differences in methodologies, other groups are expected to report 2024 as slightly cooler. The ECMWF\u2019s Copernicus research service joins us in just barely exceeding 1.6 \u00b0C (2.9 \u00b0F), while other groups are somewhat cooler. The differences between Berkeley Earth\u2019s analysis and that of other groups is discussed at the end of this report.\nA goal of keeping global warming to no more than 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) above pre-industrial has been an intense focus of international attention. This goal is defined based on multi-decadal averages, and so a single year above 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) does not directly constitute a failure. However, recent warming trends and the lack of adequate mitigation measures make it clear that the 1.5 \u00b0C goal will not be met. The long-term average of global temperature is likely to effectively cross the 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) threshold in the next 5-10 years. While the 1.5 \u00b0C goal will not be met, urgent action is still needed to limit man-made climate change. Each increment of additional warming, e.g. 1.6 \u00b0C, 1.7 \u00b0C, etc., will lead to additional and compounding climate change impacts that can still be avoided if effective mitigation steps are made to reduce man-made greenhouse gas emissions.\nDuring 2024, 24% of the Earth\u2019s surface had a locally record warm annual average, including 32% of land areas and 21% of ocean areas. These areas coincided with a number of major population centers. We estimate that 3.3 billion people \u2014 40% of Earth\u2019s population \u2014 experienced a locally record warm annual average in 2024. This includes 2/3 of the population of China, and a majority of the populations of Brazil, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Mexico, 1/3 of the United States, and much of South and Central America, and Eastern Europe.\nNone of the Earth\u2019s surface had a record cold annual average in 2024.\nDue to natural cooling patterns that have recently begun in the oceans, it is expected that 2025 will be moderately cooler than 2024. The most likely outcome is that 2025 ranks as roughly the 3rd warmest year since 1850, though warmer or cooler outcomes are also possible.\nIn addition, 2024 was notable for:\nIn Berkeley Earth\u2019s analysis the global mean temperature in 2023 is estimated to have been 1.62 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b0C (2.91 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b0F) above the average temperature from 1850-1900, a period often used as a pre-industrial baseline for global temperature targets. This is ~0.08 \u00b0C (~0.14 \u00b0F) warmer than the previous record high observed in 2023. As a result, 2024 is the warmest year to have been directly observed using thermometer measurements, and stands out well-above all previous years.\nThough the availability of thermometers limits direct measurements to the period since 1850, indirect evidence suggests that the Earth is currently at its warmest global average temperature for at least several thousand of years, and possibly the warmest since the last interglacial ~120,000 years ago.\nThe abrupt increase in temperatures from 2022 to 2024 is the largest two year increase since the 1870s.\nThis is the second time in Berkeley Earth\u2019s analysis that an annual average temperature has exceeded the pre-industrial baseline period by more than 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F), having previously done so by a small margin in 2023. It is the first time that an annual average has exceeded 1.6 \u00b0C (2.9 \u00b0F) in our analysis. As discussed at the end of this report, other research groups have slightly different estimates, some of which also cross these thresholds and others are slightly cooler.\nUnder the Paris Agreement, many countries have set an aspirational goal of limiting long-term global warming to no more than 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F). That target is based on the state of the climate averaged over many years, so it is not automatically considered to have been breached by one or two years exceeding 1.5 \u00b0C of warming. However, it is clear that this 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) threshold is no longer avoidable and the long-term average of global warming will likely cross this threshold\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Lee, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory\nSea level rise is affecting coastal communities around the world, especially those like Honolulu, pictured, that are located on islands\nCredit: NOAA Teacher at Sea Program, NOAA Ship HI\u2019IALAKAI\nA long-term sea level dataset shows ocean surface heights continuing to rise at faster and faster rates over decades of observations.\nGlobal average sea level rose by about 0.3 inches (0.76 centimeters) from 2022 to 2023, a relatively large jump due mostly to a warming climate and the development of a strong El Ni\u00f1o. The total rise is equivalent to draining a quarter of Lake Superior into the ocean over the course of a year.\nThis NASA-led analysis is based on a sea level dataset featuring more than 30 years of satellite observations, starting with the U.S.-French TOPEX/Poseidon mission, which launched in 1992. The Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich mission, which launched in November 2020, is the latest in the series of satellites that have contributed to this sea level record.\nThe data shows that global average sea level has risen a total of about 4 inches (9.4 centimeters) since 1993. The rate of this increase has also accelerated, more than doubling from 0.07 inches (0.18 centimeters) per year in 1993 to the current rate of 0.17 inches (0.42 centimeters) per year.\n\u201cCurrent rates of acceleration mean that we are on track to add another 20 centimeters of global mean sea level by 2050, doubling the amount of change in the next three decades compared to the previous 100 years and increasing the frequency and impacts of floods across the world,\u201d said Nadya Vinogradova Shiffer, director for the NASA sea level change team and the ocean physics program in Washington.\nSeasonal Effects\nGlobal sea level saw a significant jump from 2022 to 2023 due mainly to a switch between La Ni\u00f1a and El Ni\u00f1o conditions. A mild La Ni\u00f1a from 2021 to 2022 resulted in a lower-than-expected rise in sea level that year. A strong El Ni\u00f1o developed in 2023, helping to boost the average amount of rise in sea surface height.\nLa Ni\u00f1a is characterized by cooler-than-normal ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. El Ni\u00f1o involves warmer-than-average ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific. Both periodic climate phenomena affect patterns of rainfall and snowfall as well as sea levels around the world.\n\u201cDuring La Ni\u00f1a, rain that normally falls in the ocean falls on the land instead, temporarily taking water out of the ocean and lowering sea levels,\u201d said Josh Willis, a sea level researcher at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \u201cIn El Ni\u00f1o years, a lot of the rain that normally falls on land ends up in the ocean, which raises sea levels temporarily.\u201d\nA Human Footprint\nSeasonal or periodic climate phenomena can affect global average sea level from year to year. But the underlying trend for more than three decades has been increasing ocean heights as a direct response to global warming due to the excessive heat trapped by greenhouse gases in Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\u201cLong-term datasets like this 30-year satellite record allow us to differentiate between short-term effects on sea level, like El Ni\u00f1o, and trends that let us know where sea level is heading,\u201d said Ben Hamlington, lead for NASA\u2019s sea level change team at JPL.\nThese multidecadal observations wouldn\u2019t be possible without ongoing international cooperation, as well as scientific and technical innovations by NASA and other space agencies. Specifically, radar altimeters have helped produce ever-more precise measurements of sea level around the world. To calculate ocean height, these instruments bounce microwave signals off the sea surface, recording the time the signal takes to travel from a satellite to Earth and back, as well as the strength of the return signal.\nThe researchers also periodically cross-check those sea level measurements against data from other sources. These include tide gauges, as well as satellite measurements of factors like atmospheric water vapor and Earth\u2019s gravity field that can affect the accuracy of sea level measurements. Using that information, the researchers recalibrated the 30-year dataset, resulting in updates to sea levels in some previous years. That includes a sea level rise increase of 0.08 inches (0.21 centimeters) from 2021 to 2022.\nWhen researchers combine space-based altimetry data of the oceans with more than a century of observations from surface-based sources, such as tide gauges, the information dramatically improves our understanding of how sea surface height is changing on a global scale. When these sea level measurements are combined with other information, including ocean temperature, ice loss, and land motion, scientists can decipher why and how seas are rising.\nSite Manager: Carmen Blackwood NASA Responsible Official: Doug Newman\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The largest ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nHuman activities are driving the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century.\nScientists attribute the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century to the human expansion of the \"greenhouse effect\"1 \u2014 warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth toward space.\nLife on Earth depends on energy coming from the Sun. About half the light energy reaching Earth's atmosphere passes through the air and clouds to the surface, where it is absorbed and radiated in the form of infrared heat. About 90% of this heat is then absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-radiated, slowing heat loss to space.\nA vital component of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide (CO2) is released through natural processes (like volcanic eruptions) and through human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation.\nLike many atmospheric gases, methane comes from both natural and human-caused sources. Methane comes from plant-matter breakdown in wetlands and is also released from landfills and rice farming. Livestock animals emit methane from their digestion and manure. Leaks from fossil fuel production and transportation are another major source of methane, and natural gas is 70% to 90% methane.\nA potent greenhouse gas produced by farming practices, nitrous oxide is released during commercial and organic fertilizer production and use. Nitrous oxide also comes from burning fossil fuels and burning vegetation and has increased by 18% in the last 100 years.\nThese chemical compounds do not exist in nature \u2013 they are entirely of industrial origin. They were used as refrigerants, solvents (a substance that dissolves others), and spray can propellants.\nFORCING: Something acting upon Earth's climate that causes a change in how energy flows through it (such as long-lasting, heat-trapping gases - also known as greenhouse gases). These gases slow outgoing heat in the atmosphere and cause the planet to warm.\nWater vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas, but because the warming ocean increases the amount of it in our atmosphere, it is not a direct cause of climate change. Credit: John Fowler on Unsplash\nFEEDBACKS: A process where something is either amplified or reduced as time goes on, such as water vapor increasing as Earth warms leading to even more warming.\nOver the last century, burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). This increase happens because the coal or oil burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the air to make CO2. To a lesser extent, clearing of land for agriculture, industry, and other human activities has increased concentrations of greenhouse gases.\nThe industrial activities that our modern civilization depends upon have raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels by nearly 50% since 17502. This increase is due to human activities, because scientists can see a distinctive isotopic fingerprint in the atmosphere.\nIn its Sixth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, composed of scientific experts from countries all over the world, concluded that it is unequivocal that the increase of CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere over the industrial era is the result of human activities and that human influence is the principal driver of many changes observed across the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nThe panel's AR6 Working Group I (WGI) Summary for Policymakers report is online at https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/.\nScientists use a metric called Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) to measure the changes in energy the Earth receives from the Sun. TSI incorporates the 11-year solar cycle and solar flares/storms from the Sun's surface.\nStudies show that solar variability has played a role in past climate changes. For example, a decrease in solar activity coupled with increased volcanic activity helped trigger the Little Ice Age.\nBut several lines of evidence show that current global warming cannot be explained by changes in energy from the Sun:\n1.

The following is our report on global mean temperature during 2023.\nWe conclude that 2023 was the warmest year on Earth since 1850, exceeding the previous record set in 2016 by a clear and definitive margin.\nThe global annual average for 2023 in our dataset was estimated as 1.54 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b0C (2.77 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b0F) above the average during the period 1850 to 1900, which is traditionally used a reference for the preindustrial period. This is the first time that any year has exceeded the key 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) threshold. The significance of this is discussed below. Also, please note that given the uncertainties and differences in methodologies, other groups are expected to report 2023 as slightly less than 1.5 \u00b0C above preindustrial. The differences between Berkeley Earth\u2019s analysis and that of other groups is discussed at the end of this report.\nThe last nine years have included all nine of the warmest years observed in the instrumental record.\nThe long-term trend towards higher temperatures is being driven by man-made global warming. However, year-to-year rankings are likely to reflect short-term natural variability. In 2023, an emerging El Ni\u00f1o event combined with other natural and man-made factors discussed below to create a record-breaking warm year. By contrast, 2021 and 2022 had somewhat lower temperatures due to a persistent a La Ni\u00f1a event. The cyclic warming and cooling due to El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a is one of the largest sources of year-to-year internal variability in the global average temperature, often adding or subtracting 0.1 \u00b0C from the global average.\n2023 was a highly unusual year in several respects, including record warmth in most ocean basins and a large deviation from the historical trend. Warmth in 2023 greatly exceeded expectations, and was much stronger than normal this early in an El Ni\u00f1o. Some studies have recently argued that the pace of global warming may be accelerating, and some of the evidence for this is discussed below. However, given historical variability in surface temperatures, it still remains too early to conclude whether or not the pace of surface warming has increased.\nDuring 2023, 17% of the Earth\u2019s surface had a locally record warm annual average. By chance, these areas coincided with a number of major population centers. We estimate that 2.3 billion people \u2014 29% of Earth\u2019s population \u2014 experienced a locally record warm annual average in 2023. This includes half the population of China, and a majority of the populations of Bangladesh, Japan, Mexico, as well as much of South and Central America.\nNone of the Earth\u2019s surface had a record cold annual average in 2023.\nAs discussed below, we believe there are slightly better than even odds that 2024 will be warmer than 2023.\nIn addition, 2023 was notable for:\nIn Berkeley Earth\u2019s analysis the global mean temperature in 2023 is estimated to have been 1.54 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b0C (2.77 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b0F) above the average temperature from 1850-1900, a period often used as a pre-industrial baseline for global temperature targets. This is ~0.17 \u00b0C (~0.30 \u00b0F) warmer than the previous record high observed in 2016. As a result, 2023 is the warmest year to have been directly observed using thermometer measurements, and stands out well-above all previous years.\nThis is the first time that an annual average temperature has exceeded the pre-industrial baseline period by more than 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F).\nUnder the Paris Agreement, many countries have set an aspirational goal of limiting long-term global warming to no more than 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F). That target is based on the state of the climate averaged over many years, so it is not automatically considered to have been breached by a single year exceeding 1.5 \u00b0C of warming. However, a single year exceeding 1.5 \u00b0C is a stark warning sign of how close the overall climate system has come to exceeding this Paris Agreement goal. With greenhouse gas emissions continuing to set record highs, it is likely that climate will regularly exceed 1.5 \u00b0C in the next decade.\nThe last nine years stand out as the nine warmest years to have been directly observed.\nThe temperature uncertainties can be visualized using the schematic below where each year\u2019s temperature estimate is represented by a distribution reflecting its uncertainty. In the analysis that Berkeley Earth conducts, the uncertainty on the mean temperature of a single year is approximately 0.03 \u00b0C (0.05 \u00b0F) for recent years. The global mean temperature in 2023 lies far above the previous record high set in 2016 and all other years.\nThe last nine years have been part of a period of significant warmth well above all previous years since 1850. This reflects the long-term trend towards man-made global warming.\nIn 2023, the monthly-average temperature in January was similar to that in 2021 or 2022, but well below the previous record level. However, following the end of La Ni\u00f1a in the Pacific, record-breaking monthly-average warmth began in June and continued in every month through the rest of the year, often beating the previous monthly record by a large margin. September had the largest monthly anomaly ever observed, with December coming in as the second largest. Seven months in 2023 were at least 1.5 \u00b0C / 2.7 \u00b0F above their corresponding 1850-1900 average.\nOn land, 2023 was also the warmest year directly observed, reaching 2.10 \u00b0C / 3.78 \u00b0F above the 1850 to 1900 average. This is the first year with a land-average of more than 2.0 \u00b0C, and beats the previous record set in 2020 by 0.13 \u00b0C / 0.23 \u00b0F.\nAs discussed below, many territories saw local record warm annual averages in 2023.\nOn the ocean\u2019s surface, 2023 was also the warmest year directly observed, reaching 1.10 \u00b0C / 1.98 \u00b0F. This is the first year with a ocean-average above 1.0 \u00b0C, and beats the previous record set in 2020 by a very large maring, 0.16 \u00b0C / 0.29 \u00b0F\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The following is our report on global mean temperature during 2023.\nWe conclude that 2023 was the warmest year on Earth since 1850, exceeding the previous record set in 2016 by a clear and definitive margin.\nThe global annual average for 2023 in our dataset was estimated as 1.54 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b0C (2.77 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b0F) above the average during the period 1850 to 1900, which is traditionally used a reference for the preindustrial period. This is the first time that any year has exceeded the key 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) threshold. The significance of this is discussed below. Also, please note that given the uncertainties and differences in methodologies, other groups are expected to report 2023 as slightly less than 1.5 \u00b0C above preindustrial. The differences between Berkeley Earth\u2019s analysis and that of other groups is discussed at the end of this report.\nThe last nine years have included all nine of the warmest years observed in the instrumental record.\nThe long-term trend towards higher temperatures is being driven by man-made global warming. However, year-to-year rankings are likely to reflect short-term natural variability. In 2023, an emerging El Ni\u00f1o event combined with other natural and man-made factors discussed below to create a record-breaking warm year. By contrast, 2021 and 2022 had somewhat lower temperatures due to a persistent a La Ni\u00f1a event. The cyclic warming and cooling due to El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a is one of the largest sources of year-to-year internal variability in the global average temperature, often adding or subtracting 0.1 \u00b0C from the global average.\n2023 was a highly unusual year in several respects, including record warmth in most ocean basins and a large deviation from the historical trend. Warmth in 2023 greatly exceeded expectations, and was much stronger than normal this early in an El Ni\u00f1o. Some studies have recently argued that the pace of global warming may be accelerating, and some of the evidence for this is discussed below. However, given historical variability in surface temperatures, it still remains too early to conclude whether or not the pace of surface warming has increased.\nDuring 2023, 17% of the Earth\u2019s surface had a locally record warm annual average. By chance, these areas coincided with a number of major population centers. We estimate that 2.3 billion people \u2014 29% of Earth\u2019s population \u2014 experienced a locally record warm annual average in 2023. This includes half the population of China, and a majority of the populations of Bangladesh, Japan, Mexico, as well as much of South and Central America.\nNone of the Earth\u2019s surface had a record cold annual average in 2023.\nAs discussed below, we believe there are slightly better than even odds that 2024 will be warmer than 2023.\nIn addition, 2023 was notable for:\nIn Berkeley Earth\u2019s analysis the global mean temperature in 2023 is estimated to have been 1.54 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b0C (2.77 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b0F) above the average temperature from 1850-1900, a period often used as a pre-industrial baseline for global temperature targets. This is ~0.17 \u00b0C (~0.30 \u00b0F) warmer than the previous record high observed in 2016. As a result, 2023 is the warmest year to have been directly observed using thermometer measurements, and stands out well-above all previous years.\nThis is the first time that an annual average temperature has exceeded the pre-industrial baseline period by more than 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F).\nUnder the Paris Agreement, many countries have set an aspirational goal of limiting long-term global warming to no more than 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F). That target is based on the state of the climate averaged over many years, so it is not automatically considered to have been breached by a single year exceeding 1.5 \u00b0C of warming. However, a single year exceeding 1.5 \u00b0C is a stark warning sign of how close the overall climate system has come to exceeding this Paris Agreement goal. With greenhouse gas emissions continuing to set record highs, it is likely that climate will regularly exceed 1.5 \u00b0C in the next decade.\nThe last nine years stand out as the nine warmest years to have been directly observed.\nThe temperature uncertainties can be visualized using the schematic below where each year\u2019s temperature estimate is represented by a distribution reflecting its uncertainty. In the analysis that Berkeley Earth conducts, the uncertainty on the mean temperature of a single year is approximately 0.03 \u00b0C (0.05 \u00b0F) for recent years. The global mean temperature in 2023 lies far above the previous record high set in 2016 and all other years.\nThe last nine years have been part of a period of significant warmth well above all previous years since 1850. This reflects the long-term trend towards man-made global warming.\nIn 2023, the monthly-average temperature in January was similar to that in 2021 or 2022, but well below the previous record level. However, following the end of La Ni\u00f1a in the Pacific, record-breaking monthly-average warmth began in June and continued in every month through the rest of the year, often beating the previous monthly record by a large margin. September had the largest monthly anomaly ever observed, with December coming in as the second largest. Seven months in 2023 were at least 1.5 \u00b0C / 2.7 \u00b0F above their corresponding 1850-1900 average.\nOn land, 2023 was also the warmest year directly observed, reaching 2.10 \u00b0C / 3.78 \u00b0F above the 1850 to 1900 average. This is the first year with a land-average of more than 2.0 \u00b0C, and beats the previous record set in 2020 by 0.13 \u00b0C / 0.23 \u00b0F.\nAs discussed below, many territories saw local record warm annual averages in 2023.\nOn the ocean\u2019s surface, 2023 was also the warmest year directly observed, reaching 1.10 \u00b0C / 1.98 \u00b0F. This is the first year with a ocean-average above 1.0 \u00b0C, and beats the previous record set in 2020 by a very large maring, 0.16 \u00b0C / 0.29 \u00b0F\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The differences between Berkeley Earth\u2019s analysis and that of other groups is discussed at the end of this report.\nThe last nine years have included all nine of the warmest years observed in the instrumental record.\nThe long-term trend towards higher temperatures is being driven by man-made global warming. However, year-to-year rankings are likely to reflect short-term natural variability. In 2023, an emerging El Ni\u00f1o event combined with other natural and man-made factors discussed below to create a record-breaking warm year. By contrast, 2021 and 2022 had somewhat lower temperatures due to a persistent a La Ni\u00f1a event. The cyclic warming and cooling due to El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a is one of the largest sources of year-to-year internal variability in the global average temperature, often adding or subtracting 0.1 \u00b0C from the global average.\n2023 was a highly unusual year in several respects, including record warmth in most ocean basins and a large deviation from the historical trend. Warmth in 2023 greatly exceeded expectations, and was much stronger than normal this early in an El Ni\u00f1o. Some studies have recently argued that the pace of global warming may be accelerating, and some of the evidence for this is discussed below. However, given historical variability in surface temperatures, it still remains too early to conclude whether or not the pace of surface warming has increased.\nDuring 2023, 17% of the Earth\u2019s surface had a locally record warm annual average. By chance, these areas coincided with a number of major population centers. We estimate that 2.3 billion people \u2014 29% of Earth\u2019s population \u2014 experienced a locally record warm annual average in 2023. This includes half the population of China, and a majority of the populations of Bangladesh, Japan, Mexico, as well as much of South and Central America.\nNone of the Earth\u2019s surface had a record cold annual average in 2023.\nAs discussed below, we believe there are slightly better than even odds that 2024 will be warmer than 2023.\nIn addition, 2023 was notable for:\nIn Berkeley Earth\u2019s analysis the global mean temperature in 2023 is estimated to have been 1.54 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b0C (2.77 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b0F) above the average temperature from 1850-1900, a period often used as a pre-industrial baseline for global temperature targets. This is ~0.17 \u00b0C (~0.30 \u00b0F) warmer than the previous record high observed in 2016. As a result, 2023 is the warmest year to have been directly observed using thermometer measurements, and stands out well-above all previous years.\nThis is the first time that an annual average temperature has exceeded the pre-industrial baseline period by more than 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F).\nUnder the Paris Agreement, many countries have set an aspirational goal of limiting long-term global warming to no more than 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F). That target is based on the state of the climate averaged over many years, so it is not automatically considered to have been breached by a single year exceeding 1.5 \u00b0C of warming. However, a single year exceeding 1.5 \u00b0C is a stark warning sign of how close the overall climate system has come to exceeding this Paris Agreement goal. With greenhouse gas emissions continuing to set record highs, it is likely that climate will regularly exceed 1.5 \u00b0C in the next decade.\nThe last nine years stand out as the nine warmest years to have been directly observed.\nThe temperature uncertainties can be visualized using the schematic below where each year\u2019s temperature estimate is represented by a distribution reflecting its uncertainty. In the analysis that Berkeley Earth conducts, the uncertainty on the mean temperature of a single year is approximately 0.03 \u00b0C (0.05 \u00b0F) for recent years. The global mean temperature in 2023 lies far above the previous record high set in 2016 and all other years.\nThe last nine years have been part of a period of significant warmth well above all previous years since 1850. This reflects the long-term trend towards man-made global warming.\nIn 2023, the monthly-average temperature in January was similar to that in 2021 or 2022, but well below the previous record level. However, following the end of La Ni\u00f1a in the Pacific, record-breaking monthly-average warmth began in June and continued in every month through the rest of the year, often beating the previous monthly record by a large margin. September had the largest monthly anomaly ever observed, with December coming in as the second largest. Seven months in 2023 were at least 1.5 \u00b0C / 2.7 \u00b0F above their corresponding 1850-1900 average.\nOn land, 2023 was also the warmest year directly observed, reaching 2.10 \u00b0C / 3.78 \u00b0F above the 1850 to 1900 average. This is the first year with a land-average of more than 2.0 \u00b0C, and beats the previous record set in 2020 by 0.13 \u00b0C / 0.23 \u00b0F.\nAs discussed below, many territories saw local record warm annual averages in 2023.\nOn the ocean\u2019s surface, 2023 was also the warmest year directly observed, reaching 1.10 \u00b0C / 1.98 \u00b0F. This is the first year with a ocean-average above 1.0 \u00b0C, and beats the previous record set in 2020 by a very large maring, 0.16 \u00b0C / 0.29 \u00b0F\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Events influenced by climate change, particularly wildfires, also are increasing.\nRisks from extreme weather and climate events arise from the intersection of the physical hazard (e.g., wind and rain), the extent of exposure to the hazard, the vulnerability of individuals and communities, and the capacity to prepare for, manage, and recover from extreme events.\nA disaster generally is defined as a sudden, calamitous event that disrupts the functioning of a community or society and that exceeds its ability to cope using its own resources (81). The occurrence of an extreme event is not required for a community or region to experience extreme impacts, such as large increase in mortality; an extreme impact can arise from a moderately strong event when it occurs in a highly vulnerable population. The converse also is true, that an extreme event may not result in extreme impacts when communities are prepared.\nRoughly 20% of disasters in 2019 occurred in North America, including the Caribbean and Central America, for total damages of US$55 billion, of which US$29 billion were insured (130). Loss events included Hurricane Dorian, which caused billions of dollars in damage, especially in the Bahamas, in late August to early September. Heavy losses that year also resulted from severe weather, floods, and a winter storm in the United States. A mixture of snowmelt triggered by unusually high temperatures in March and storms with torrential rain led to sustained and extensive flooding in Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, and Mississippi (49).\nOverall, the numbers and costs of disasters have been increasing for several decades due to increases in exposure (more people moving into harm\u2019s way and increases in the values of property and infrastructure at risk), vulnerability of people and infrastructure, and climate change (170). Since 1980, the United States has experienced 265 weather and climate disasters in which the overall damages reached or exceeded US$1 billion; the total costs were greater than US$1.775 trillion (132), with an estimated 14,223 deaths (an average of 356 per year), although the numbers of deaths are likely an underestimate (178).\nBeyond the damage to infrastructure, extreme weather events and disasters can affect the health and well-being of individuals and can have catastrophic impacts on communities and health systems. People can suffer from a wide range of physical effects (e.g., heat exhaustion, injuries in severe storms, and respiratory illnesses from molds due to floods) as well as longer-term impacts on mental health.

These events and events influenced by climate change, such as wildfires, continue to cause significant human morbidity and mortality and adversely affect mental health and well-being. Although adverse health impacts from extreme events declined over the past few decades, climate change and more people moving into harm\u2019s way could alter this trend. Long-term changes to Earth\u2019s energy balance are increasing the frequency and intensity of many extreme events and the probability of compound events, with trends projected to accelerate under certain greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. While most of these events cannot be completely avoided, many of the health risks could be prevented through building climate-resilient health systems with improved risk reduction, preparation, response, and recovery. Conducting vulnerability and adaptation assessments and developing health system adaptation plans can identify priority actions to effectively reduce risks, such as disaster risk management and more resilient infrastructure. The risks are urgent, so action is needed now.\nKeywords: climate change, climate variability, extreme events, population health, health systems\nWorldwide, in 2019, there were 396 disasters1 that killed 11,755 people, affected 95 million others, and cost nearly US$130 billion (28).

Two-thirds of the warming has occurred since 1975.\n\nFull Page Content:\nAir temperatures on Earth have been rising since the Industrial Revolution. While natural variability plays some part, the preponderance of evidence indicates that human activities\u2014particularly emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases\u2014are mostly responsible for making our planet warmer.\nAccording to an ongoing temperature analysis led by scientists at NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), the average global temperature on Earth has increased by at least 1.1\u00b0 Celsius (1.9\u00b0 Fahrenheit) since 1880. The majority of the warming has occurred since 1975, at a rate of roughly 0.15 to 0.20\u00b0C per decade.\nThe maps above show temperature anomalies in five-year increments since 1880. (Click on the arrow to run the animation.) These are not absolute temperatures, but changes from the norm for each area. The data reflect how much warmer or cooler each region was compared to a base period of 1951-1980. (The global mean surface air temperature for that period was 14\u00b0C (57\u00b0F), with an uncertainty of several tenths of a degree.)\nThe image below shows global temperature anomalies in 2022, which tied for the fifth warmest year on record. The past nine years have been the warmest years since modern recordkeeping began in 1880.\nAs the maps show, global warming does not mean temperatures rise everywhere at every time by same rate. Temperatures might rise 5 degrees in one region and drop 2 degrees in another. For instance, exceptionally cold winters in one place might be balanced by extremely warm winters in another part of the world. Generally, warming is greater over land than over the oceans because water is slower to absorb and release heat (thermal inertia). Warming may also differ substantially within specific land masses and ocean basins.\nIn the animation at the top of the page and in the bar chart below, the years from 1880 to 1939 tend to be cooler, then level off by the 1950s. Decades within the base period (1951-1980) do not appear particularly warm or cold because they are the standard against which other years are measured.\nThe leveling off of temperatures in the middle of the 20th century can be explained by natural variability and by the cooling effects of aerosols generated by factories, power plants, and motor vehicles in the years of rapid economic growth after World War II. Fossil fuel use also increased after the war (5 percent per year), boosting greenhouse gases. Cooling from aerosol pollution happened rapidly. In contrast, greenhouse gases accumulated slowly, but they remain in the atmosphere for a much longer time. According to former GISS director James Hansen, the strong warming trend of the past four decades likely reflects a shift from balanced aerosol and greenhouse gas effects on the atmosphere to a predominance of greenhouse gas effects after aerosols were curbed by pollution controls.\nWhy should we care about one or two degrees of global warming? After all, temperatures fluctuate by many degrees every day where we live.\nThe temperatures we experience locally and in short periods can fluctuate significantly due to predictable, cyclical events (night and day, summer and winter) and hard-to-predict wind and precipitation patterns. But the global temperature mainly depends on how much energy the planet receives from the Sun and how much it radiates back into space. The energy coming from the Sun fluctuates very little by year, while the amount of energy radiated by Earth is closely tied to the chemical composition of the atmosphere\u2014particularly the amount of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.\nA one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all of the oceans, the atmosphere, and the land masses by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age. A five-degree drop was enough to bury a large part of North America under a towering mass of ice 20,000 years ago.\nGlobal temperature records start around 1880 because observations did not sufficiently cover enough of the planet prior to that time. The line plot above shows yearly temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2020 as recorded by NASA, NOAA, the Berkeley Earth research group, the Met Office Hadley Centre (United Kingdom), and the Cowtan and Way analysis. Though there are minor variations from year to year, all five records show peaks and valleys in sync with each other. All show rapid warming in the past few decades, and all show the last decade as the warmest.\nThe NASA GISS team chose the period of 1951-1980 as its baseline largely because the U.S. National Weather Service uses a three-decade period to define \u201cnormal\u201d or average temperature. The GISS temperature analysis effort also began around 1980, so the most recent 30 years was 1951-1980. Their objective is to provide an estimate of temperature change that could be compared with predictions of global climate change in response to atmospheric carbon dioxide, aerosols, and changes in solar activity.\nNASA\u2019s temperature analyses incorporate surface temperature measurements from more than 20,000 weather stations, ship- and buoy-based observations of sea surface temperatures, and temperature measurements from Antarctic research stations. These in situ measurements are analyzed using an algorithm that considers the varied spacing of temperature stations around the globe and urban heat island effects.\nSubscribe to the Earth Observatory and get the Earth in your inbox.\nNASA's Earth Observatory brings you the Earth, every day, with in-depth stories and stunning imagery.\nExplore Earth Science\nEarth Science Data\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The following is our report on global mean temperature during 2024.\nWe conclude that 2024 was the warmest year on Earth since 1850, exceeding the previous record just set in 2023 by a clear and definitive margin. This period, since 1850, is the time when sufficient direct measurements from thermometers exist to create a purely instrumental estimate of changes in global mean temperature.\nThe last ten years have included all ten of the warmest years observed in the instrumental record.\nThe warming spike observed in 2023 and 2024 has been extreme and represents a larger than expected deviation from the previous warming trend. The spike has multiple causes, including both natural variability and man-made global warming from the accumulation of greenhouses gases; however, as discussed below, we believe additional factors are needed to explain the full magnitude of this event. Reductions in low cloud cover and man-made sulfur aerosol pollution are likely to have played a significant additional role in recent warming.\nOver the previous 50 years, global warming has preceded in an almost linear fashion, consistent with an almost linear increase in the total greenhouse gas forcing. The warming spike in 2023/2024 suggests that the past warming rate is no longer a reliable predictor of the future, and additional factors have created conditions for faster warming, at least in the short-term.\nThe global annual average for 2024 in our dataset is estimated as 1.62 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b0C (2.91 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b0F) above the average during the period 1850 to 1900, which is traditionally used a reference for the pre-industrial period. This is first time Berkeley Earth has reported an annual average above 1.6 \u00b0C (2.9 \u00b0F), and the only second time that Berkeley Earth has reported any year exceeding the key 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) threshold, after slightly doing so in 2023. Due to uncertainties and differences in methodologies, other groups are expected to report 2024 as slightly cooler. The ECMWF\u2019s Copernicus research service joins us in just barely exceeding 1.6 \u00b0C (2.9 \u00b0F), while other groups are somewhat cooler. The differences between Berkeley Earth\u2019s analysis and that of other groups is discussed at the end of this report.\nA goal of keeping global warming to no more than 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) above pre-industrial has been an intense focus of international attention. This goal is defined based on multi-decadal averages, and so a single year above 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) does not directly constitute a failure. However, recent warming trends and the lack of adequate mitigation measures make it clear that the 1.5 \u00b0C goal will not be met. The long-term average of global temperature is likely to effectively cross the 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) threshold in the next 5-10 years. While the 1.5 \u00b0C goal will not be met, urgent action is still needed to limit man-made climate change. Each increment of additional warming, e.g. 1.6 \u00b0C, 1.7 \u00b0C, etc., will lead to additional and compounding climate change impacts that can still be avoided if effective mitigation steps are made to reduce man-made greenhouse gas emissions.\nDuring 2024, 24% of the Earth\u2019s surface had a locally record warm annual average, including 32% of land areas and 21% of ocean areas. These areas coincided with a number of major population centers. We estimate that 3.3 billion people \u2014 40% of Earth\u2019s population \u2014 experienced a locally record warm annual average in 2024. This includes 2/3 of the population of China, and a majority of the populations of Brazil, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Mexico, 1/3 of the United States, and much of South and Central America, and Eastern Europe.\nNone of the Earth\u2019s surface had a record cold annual average in 2024.\nDue to natural cooling patterns that have recently begun in the oceans, it is expected that 2025 will be moderately cooler than 2024. The most likely outcome is that 2025 ranks as roughly the 3rd warmest year since 1850, though warmer or cooler outcomes are also possible.\nIn addition, 2024 was notable for:\nIn Berkeley Earth\u2019s analysis the global mean temperature in 2023 is estimated to have been 1.62 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b0C (2.91 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b0F) above the average temperature from 1850-1900, a period often used as a pre-industrial baseline for global temperature targets. This is ~0.08 \u00b0C (~0.14 \u00b0F) warmer than the previous record high observed in 2023. As a result, 2024 is the warmest year to have been directly observed using thermometer measurements, and stands out well-above all previous years.\nThough the availability of thermometers limits direct measurements to the period since 1850, indirect evidence suggests that the Earth is currently at its warmest global average temperature for at least several thousand of years, and possibly the warmest since the last interglacial ~120,000 years ago.\nThe abrupt increase in temperatures from 2022 to 2024 is the largest two year increase since the 1870s.\nThis is the second time in Berkeley Earth\u2019s analysis that an annual average temperature has exceeded the pre-industrial baseline period by more than 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F), having previously done so by a small margin in 2023. It is the first time that an annual average has exceeded 1.6 \u00b0C (2.9 \u00b0F) in our analysis. As discussed at the end of this report, other research groups have slightly different estimates, some of which also cross these thresholds and others are slightly cooler.\nUnder the Paris Agreement, many countries have set an aspirational goal of limiting long-term global warming to no more than 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F). That target is based on the state of the climate averaged over many years, so it is not automatically considered to have been breached by one or two years exceeding 1.5 \u00b0C of warming. However, it is clear that this 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) threshold is no longer avoidable and the long-term average of global warming will likely cross this threshold\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The following is our report on global mean temperature during 2024.\nWe conclude that 2024 was the warmest year on Earth since 1850, exceeding the previous record just set in 2023 by a clear and definitive margin. This period, since 1850, is the time when sufficient direct measurements from thermometers exist to create a purely instrumental estimate of changes in global mean temperature.\nThe last ten years have included all ten of the warmest years observed in the instrumental record.\nThe warming spike observed in 2023 and 2024 has been extreme and represents a larger than expected deviation from the previous warming trend. The spike has multiple causes, including both natural variability and man-made global warming from the accumulation of greenhouses gases; however, as discussed below, we believe additional factors are needed to explain the full magnitude of this event. Reductions in low cloud cover and man-made sulfur aerosol pollution are likely to have played a significant additional role in recent warming.\nOver the previous 50 years, global warming has preceded in an almost linear fashion, consistent with an almost linear increase in the total greenhouse gas forcing. The warming spike in 2023/2024 suggests that the past warming rate is no longer a reliable predictor of the future, and additional factors have created conditions for faster warming, at least in the short-term.\nThe global annual average for 2024 in our dataset is estimated as 1.62 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b0C (2.91 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b0F) above the average during the period 1850 to 1900, which is traditionally used a reference for the pre-industrial period. This is first time Berkeley Earth has reported an annual average above 1.6 \u00b0C (2.9 \u00b0F), and the only second time that Berkeley Earth has reported any year exceeding the key 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) threshold, after slightly doing so in 2023. Due to uncertainties and differences in methodologies, other groups are expected to report 2024 as slightly cooler. The ECMWF\u2019s Copernicus research service joins us in just barely exceeding 1.6 \u00b0C (2.9 \u00b0F), while other groups are somewhat cooler. The differences between Berkeley Earth\u2019s analysis and that of other groups is discussed at the end of this report.\nA goal of keeping global warming to no more than 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) above pre-industrial has been an intense focus of international attention. This goal is defined based on multi-decadal averages, and so a single year above 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) does not directly constitute a failure. However, recent warming trends and the lack of adequate mitigation measures make it clear that the 1.5 \u00b0C goal will not be met. The long-term average of global temperature is likely to effectively cross the 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) threshold in the next 5-10 years. While the 1.5 \u00b0C goal will not be met, urgent action is still needed to limit man-made climate change. Each increment of additional warming, e.g. 1.6 \u00b0C, 1.7 \u00b0C, etc., will lead to additional and compounding climate change impacts that can still be avoided if effective mitigation steps are made to reduce man-made greenhouse gas emissions.\nDuring 2024, 24% of the Earth\u2019s surface had a locally record warm annual average, including 32% of land areas and 21% of ocean areas. These areas coincided with a number of major population centers. We estimate that 3.3 billion people \u2014 40% of Earth\u2019s population \u2014 experienced a locally record warm annual average in 2024. This includes 2/3 of the population of China, and a majority of the populations of Brazil, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Mexico, 1/3 of the United States, and much of South and Central America, and Eastern Europe.\nNone of the Earth\u2019s surface had a record cold annual average in 2024.\nDue to natural cooling patterns that have recently begun in the oceans, it is expected that 2025 will be moderately cooler than 2024. The most likely outcome is that 2025 ranks as roughly the 3rd warmest year since 1850, though warmer or cooler outcomes are also possible.\nIn addition, 2024 was notable for:\nIn Berkeley Earth\u2019s analysis the global mean temperature in 2023 is estimated to have been 1.62 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b0C (2.91 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b0F) above the average temperature from 1850-1900, a period often used as a pre-industrial baseline for global temperature targets. This is ~0.08 \u00b0C (~0.14 \u00b0F) warmer than the previous record high observed in 2023. As a result, 2024 is the warmest year to have been directly observed using thermometer measurements, and stands out well-above all previous years.\nThough the availability of thermometers limits direct measurements to the period since 1850, indirect evidence suggests that the Earth is currently at its warmest global average temperature for at least several thousand of years, and possibly the warmest since the last interglacial ~120,000 years ago.\nThe abrupt increase in temperatures from 2022 to 2024 is the largest two year increase since the 1870s.\nThis is the second time in Berkeley Earth\u2019s analysis that an annual average temperature has exceeded the pre-industrial baseline period by more than 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F), having previously done so by a small margin in 2023. It is the first time that an annual average has exceeded 1.6 \u00b0C (2.9 \u00b0F) in our analysis. As discussed at the end of this report, other research groups have slightly different estimates, some of which also cross these thresholds and others are slightly cooler.\nUnder the Paris Agreement, many countries have set an aspirational goal of limiting long-term global warming to no more than 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F). That target is based on the state of the climate averaged over many years, so it is not automatically considered to have been breached by one or two years exceeding 1.5 \u00b0C of warming. However, it is clear that this 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) threshold is no longer avoidable and the long-term average of global warming will likely cross this threshold\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Blue bars indicate cooler-than-average years; red bars show warmer-than-average years. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Information.\nAccording to the annual report from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, 2024 was the warmest year since global records began in 1850. The global average surface temperature was 2.32 Fahrenheit (1.29 degrees Celsius) above the 20th-century average (57.0 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.9 degrees Celsius) and 2.63 degrees Fahrenheit (1.46 degrees Celsius) above the pre-industrial average (56.7 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.7 degrees Celsius), which NOAA defines as the period from 1850-1900.\nGlobal temperatures in 2024 were above the 1991-2020 average (red) across most of the planet. Yearly temperatures compared to the 20th-century average (bar chart) show that it has been 48 years since Earth had a cooler-than-average year. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe 2024 global temperature anomaly (anomaly means \u201cdifference from average\u201d) is 0.18 degrees F (0.10 degrees C) warmer than the previous record, set the year before, in 2023. The ten warmest years in the 175-year record have all occurred during the last decade (2015\u20132024). When the new century started in 2000, the first year to set a new high-temperature record was 2005. Now, 2005 is just the 13th-warmest year on record.\nOther 2024 rankings included...\nFor more regional details and 2024 climate statistics, see the 2024 Global Climate Report from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe global average surface temperature is an indicator of the state of Earth\u2019s energy balance: how much sunlight it absorbs minus how much heat it radiates back to space. When these amounts are the same, Earth\u2019s average surface temperature remains steady. When they are out of balance, Earth cools or warms. Earth\u2019s average surface temperature has been rising because human-produced greenhouse gases are causing Earth to absorb more energy than it radiates back to space.\nGiven the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of added heat energy to raise Earth\u2019s average surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree-Fahrenheit (1-degree-Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1850-1900 in NOAA's record) might seem small, but it represents a significant increase in heat energy circulating through all parts of the Earth system, including the oceans, frozen landscapes, and the atmosphere.\nBeyond being an indicator of changes in Earth\u2019s energy balance, surface temperature matters because it controls many environmental and ecological processes that are important to humans and other life, including the water cycle (evaporation, clouds, surface water supplies, and precipitation), the carbon cycle, and the kinds of plants, animals, and other living things that can survive in different places on Earth.\nThe concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (55 degrees Celsius) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the \"average\" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget, which can only be directly measured from space.\nTo calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute temperature readings to temperature anomalies\u2014the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend.\nAcross inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and known physical relationships\u2014such as the way temperature decreases with altitude\u2014to estimate the missing values. Each value is then used to calculate a global-scale temperature anomaly. This process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in Earth's surface temperature over time. Read more about how the global surface temperature record is built in our Climate Data Primer.\nTemperature change has not been uniform across the planet, but more areas are warming than cooling. And the rate of warming has accelerated in recent decades. According to NOAA's 2024 Annual Climate Report the combined land and ocean temperature has warmed at an average rate of 0.11 degrees Fahrenheit (0.06 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1850 and more than three times that rate (0.36 degrees Fahrenheit, or 0.20 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1975.\nRecent rates of global warming (1994-2024, bottom) are larger than the longer-term average rates (1901-2024, top). Places that have cooled are colored blue; places that have warmed are colored yellow, orange, or red. In the past three decades, many places in the Northern Hemisphere have warmed by 1 degree Fahrenheit or more per decade. Differences are most dramatic in the Arctic. With the decline of ice and snow, the Arctic reflects less incoming sunlight, which amplifies the rate of greenhouse-gas-driven warming. NOAA Climate.gov, based o\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

When fires ignite the landscape, NASA\u2019s satellites and instruments can detect and track them. This information helps communities and land managers around the world prepare for and respond to fires, and also provides a rich data source to help scientists better understand this growing risk.\nNASA's Terra and Aqua satellites detect active wildfires twice each day. Scientists studied this data over a 21-year span and found that extreme wildfires have become more frequent, more intense, and larger. The largest increase in extreme fire behavior was in the temperate conifer forests of the Western U.S. and the boreal forests of northern North America and Russia. Warmer nighttime temperatures are a major contributing factor, allowing fire activity to persist overnight.\nSee the research - Increasing frequency and intensity of the most extreme wildfires on Earth\nIn 2021, a destructive wintertime wildfire in Colorado became part of a growing trend of wildfire activity extending well beyond the summer. By looking back at 35 years of weather data, U.S. Forest Service scientists found that fire seasons are starting earlier in the spring and extending later into autumn. Parts of the Western United States, Mexico, Brazil, and East Africa now have fire seasons that are more than a month longer than they were 35 years ago. Wildfires also can be a major source of carbon dioxide emissions. Researchers found that carbon emissions from forest fires increased by 60% globally between 2001 and 2023. Fire emissions from boreal forests in Eurasia and North America nearly tripled during that same time period, driven by a warmer, drier climate. In 2023, Canada\u2019s warmest and driest conditions since 1980 stoked extreme fires that lasted for five months. NASA researchers found that these fires released about 640 million metric tons of carbon. See the research: - Fire seasons getting longer, more frequent - Global rise in forest fire emissions linked to climate change in the extratropics\nNASA Study Tallies Carbon Emissions from Massive Canadian Fires\nAlthough some variations in the weather are natural, human-caused climate change has been found to be the main cause for increasing fire weather in the American West. As the planet warms, hotter weather, earlier melting of winter snow, warmer nighttime temperatures, and decreasing summer rainfall are all contributing to increased fire activity. In the Western U.S., the amount of summertime precipitation has the biggest effect on how much land area is burned in a given year. Historical efforts to reduce all wildfires led to decades of fire suppression, which has caused a buildup of fuels in some forests. This combination of fuel build-up and warmer, drier conditions increases the potential for extreme fires. See the research: - Decreasing fire season precipitation increased recent western U.S. forest wildfire activity - Quantifying contributions of natural variability and anthropogenic forcings on increased fire weather risk over the Western United States\nA Drier Future Sets the Stage for More Wildfires\nFire is a natural part of many landscapes, and sometimes it is beneficial to forests and grassland ecosystems that have evolved with fire. Many different factors influence wildfire behavior, such as forest health, weather, topography, and forest management practices. A warming climate is increasing some types of fire activity, leading to larger and more destructive fires, more intensive firefighting efforts, and widespread smoke\nThe size and number of wildfires in the United States has been recorded since 1983 by the National Interagency Fire Center. Over the past 20 years, the amount of land area burned each year has increased as wildfires have grown larger, while the number of fires each year has remained fairly constant.\nSee the data from the National Interagency Fire Center (current through 2023)\nFires are part of both natural processes and human land use practices. Our ability to understand fire activity in different parts of the world is strengthened by international collaborations such as the Global Wildfire Information System, which includes data from NASA satellites. For example, Indigenous and nomadic cultures have historically relied on fire as a tool to clear land, keep shrubs from encroaching into grazing areas, and maintain healthy ecosystems. Periodic fires have played a role in stewarding savanna and grassland habitats for thousands of years. In some regions, fires are commonly used to clear crop residue and prepare land for new plantings. Over time, humans have gradually shifted away from nomadic life toward building homes, roads, and farms in permanent locations. These changes in cultural practices have reduced the use of fire as a land management tool. Global fire data shows that the total amount of land burned each year is decreasing, particularly in shrublands, grasslands, and savannas.\nLearn more: Building a Long-Term Record of Fire\nNASA\u2019s Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) mapping tool offers near-real time fire data.

Scientists studied this data over a 21-year span and found that extreme wildfires have become more frequent, more intense, and larger. The largest increase in extreme fire behavior was in the temperate conifer forests of the Western U.S. and the boreal forests of northern North America and Russia. Warmer nighttime temperatures are a major contributing factor, allowing fire activity to persist overnight.\nSee the research - Increasing frequency and intensity of the most extreme wildfires on Earth\nIn 2021, a destructive wintertime wildfire in Colorado became part of a growing trend of wildfire activity extending well beyond the summer. By looking back at 35 years of weather data, U.S. Forest Service scientists found that fire seasons are starting earlier in the spring and extending later into autumn. Parts of the Western United States, Mexico, Brazil, and East Africa now have fire seasons that are more than a month longer than they were 35 years ago. Wildfires also can be a major source of carbon dioxide emissions. Researchers found that carbon emissions from forest fires increased by 60% globally between 2001 and 2023.

As the planet warms, hotter weather, earlier melting of winter snow, warmer nighttime temperatures, and decreasing summer rainfall are all contributing to increased fire activity. In the Western U.S., the amount of summertime precipitation has the biggest effect on how much land area is burned in a given year.

Located on a 5-mile-long (8-kilometer-long) barrier island, the community is separated from the mainland by the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway and marsh savannas. It\u2019s a pleasant seaside resort, with restaurants, tourist amenities, and row upon row of stilt homes, many right on the beach. My bedroom looked out over small sand dunes to the shimmering Atlantic, which, at high tide, ebbed and flowed not much farther than a stone\u2019s throw away. From my vantage point, there were no clues that the sea here might not always be a friendly neighbor.\nA short stroll along the beach quickly provided a starkly different perspective. Just a few dozen yards away, huge sandbags were piled high, guarding a number of homes from the sea. As I continued walking, I soon found myself in front of homes that were perched literally above the waves at high tide.\nI passed a woman walking her dog and asked her about the homes. \u201cThere used to be two streets of houses in front of these homes,\u201d she told me. \u201cNow they\u2019re oceanfront.\u201d\nIt turns out the homes at the east end of Ocean Isle Beach were victims of coastal erosion, which is common at most beaches in North Carolina and throughout the world. An eroding beach can lose several feet of sand a year. Of course, storms, including hurricanes, can result in rapid beach erosion. But there\u2019s also chronic, long-term erosion, caused by changes in the supply of sand to a beach and in relative sea level (how much the height of the ocean rises or falls relative to the land at a particular location). Records show sea level in this part of coastal North Carolina has risen about 7.6 centimeters (3 inches) since the early 1980s. According to the U.S. Global Change Research Program, coastal erosion results in U.S. coastal property losses of about a half billion dollars each year in the form of damaged structures and lost land.\nThe case of Ocean Isle Beach illustrates a key paradox about sea level rise: since it occurs relatively slowly, it can be easy to think it\u2019s not happening. But as oceanographer and climate scientist Josh Willis of NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, told me, if you\u2019re not seeing it, you\u2019re just not looking in the right place.\n\u201cThanks to satellite and tide gauge data, we know that sea level is rising about 3.3 millimeters (0.13 inches) a year, a rate that grows by another 1 millimeter (0.04 inches) per year every decade or so,\u201d Willis said. \u201cEach year, global warming is currently adding about 750 gigatonnes of water to the ocean \u2013 enough to cover my home state of Texas about 1 meter (more than 3 feet) deep. We can\u2019t really eyeball a few millimeters of sea level rise a year just by looking at the ocean because of waves, tides, etc. But we can definitely see the effects of it, both short- and long-term.\u201d\nWillis said sea level rise accelerates and exacerbates the natural coastal erosion that\u2019s continually taking place in locations like Ocean Isle Beach. \u201cSea level rise literally eats away at a coastline, making it more vulnerable to floods,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile floods happen naturally, it\u2019s sea level rise that causes them to gradually begin topping natural barriers\u2014like wetlands, mangrove forests and saltwater marshes\u2014and even human-built barriers that typically protect coastal areas around the world from flooding. All of a sudden, that flood that you used to be protected from is now wiping you out.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the same story all over the world. You may not be able to eyeball sea level rise at your local beach, but its effects are being felt in many ways. Willis says a good rule of thumb is that every inch of sea level rise results in the loss of about 2.5 meters (100 inches) of beach, though recent studies suggest beach losses around the globe could happen even faster.\nIn many places, sea level rise has rendered sea walls erected decades ago to handle 100-year floods inadequate. Floods that used to occur once a century are now happening once a decade. You can also see the impacts of sea level rise reflected in gradual damage to infrastructure, such as the condition of coastal roads like California\u2019s Pacific Coast Highway, which is continually battling the effects of coastal erosion.\nAnother phenomenon many people are experiencing more frequently but may not necessarily think is an impact of sea level rise is high tide flooding, otherwise known as \u201cnuisance,\u201d or \u201csunny day\u201d flooding. This type of flooding, which is generally low-level, occurs year-round during high tides. Its effects range from inconveniences to the public, such as the closure of roads, businesses and schools, to long-term infrastructure damage and overwhelmed storm drains. Climate-related sea level rise is a primary contributor to high tide flooding, as is the loss of natural coastal barriers. Another contributor is the sinking of coastal lands due to adjustments related to the end of the last Ice Age, tectonics, compaction of sediments, and other dynamic processes. In the United States, high tide flooding is especially common along the East and Gulf Coasts. Over the last two decades, their frequency is up by roughly 50 percent; 100 percent if you go back three decades.\nNorfolk, Virginia, is a good case in point. Norfolk, home to the world\u2019s largest Naval base, is one of several municipalities that comprise Virginia\u2019s Hampton Roads region, which has a population of more than 1.8 million. In the 20th century, sea level relative to land in Norfolk rose between 4 and 5 millimeters (0.16 to 0.2 inches) a year, in part because the land in this region is sinking as it continues to adjust to the melting of the Laurentide ice sheet that covered it during the last Ice Age. Over the past couple of decades, high tide flooding here has accelerated rapidly, and now occurs about 10 days a year, causing flooding in\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

But there\u2019s also chronic, long-term erosion, caused by changes in the supply of sand to a beach and in relative sea level (how much the height of the ocean rises or falls relative to the land at a particular location). Records show sea level in this part of coastal North Carolina has risen about 7.6 centimeters (3 inches) since the early 1980s. According to the U.S. Global Change Research Program, coastal erosion results in U.S. coastal property losses of about a half billion dollars each year in the form of damaged structures and lost land.\nThe case of Ocean Isle Beach illustrates a key paradox about sea level rise: since it occurs relatively slowly, it can be easy to think it\u2019s not happening.

We can\u2019t really eyeball a few millimeters of sea level rise a year just by looking at the ocean because of waves, tides, etc. But we can definitely see the effects of it, both short- and long-term.\u201d\nWillis said sea level rise accelerates and exacerbates the natural coastal erosion that\u2019s continually taking place in locations like Ocean Isle Beach. \u201cSea level rise literally eats away at a coastline, making it more vulnerable to floods,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile floods happen naturally, it\u2019s sea level rise that causes them to gradually begin topping natural barriers\u2014like wetlands, mangrove forests and saltwater marshes\u2014and even human-built barriers that typically protect coastal areas around the world from flooding. All of a sudden, that flood that you used to be protected from is now wiping you out.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the same story all over the world. You may not be able to eyeball sea level rise at your local beach, but its effects are being felt in many ways. Willis says a good rule of thumb is that every inch of sea level rise results in the loss of about 2.5 meters (100 inches) of beach, though recent studies suggest beach losses around the globe could happen even faster.\nIn many places, sea level rise has rendered sea walls erected decades ago to handle 100-year floods inadequate. Floods that used to occur once a century are now happening once a decade. You can also see the impacts of sea level rise reflected in gradual damage to infrastructure, such as the condition of coastal roads like California\u2019s Pacific Coast Highway, which is continually battling the effects of coastal erosion.\nAnother phenomenon many people are experiencing more frequently but may not necessarily think is an impact of sea level rise is high tide flooding, otherwise known as \u201cnuisance,\u201d or \u201csunny day\u201d flooding.

Over the last two decades, their frequency is up by roughly 50 percent; 100 percent if you go back three decades.\nNorfolk, Virginia, is a good case in point. Norfolk, home to the world\u2019s largest Naval base, is one of several municipalities that comprise Virginia\u2019s Hampton Roads region, which has a population of more than 1.8 million. In the 20th century, sea level relative to land in Norfolk rose between 4 and 5 millimeters (0.16 to 0.2 inches) a year, in part because the land in this region is sinking as it continues to adjust to the melting of the Laurentide ice sheet that covered it during the last Ice Age. Over the past couple of decades, high tide flooding here has accelerated rapidly, and now occurs about 10 days a year, causing flooding in\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",
