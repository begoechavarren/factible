Heat-trapping greenhouse gases emitted by humans, mainly from burning fossil ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nThe greenhouse effect is the process through which heat is trapped near Earth's surface by substances known as 'greenhouse gases.' Imagine these gases as a cozy blanket enveloping our planet, helping to maintain a warmer temperature than it would have otherwise. Greenhouse gases consist of carbon dioxide, methane, ozone, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons, and water vapor. Water vapor, which reacts to temperature changes, is referred to as a 'feedback', because it amplifies the effect of forces that initially caused the warming.\nScientists have determined that carbon dioxide plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability of Earth's atmosphere. If carbon dioxide were removed, the terrestrial greenhouse effect would collapse, and Earth's surface temperature would drop significantly, by approximately 33\u00b0C (59\u00b0F).\nGreenhouse gases are part of Earth's atmosphere. This is why Earth is often called the 'Goldilocks' planet \u2013 its conditions are just right, not too hot or too cold, allowing life to thrive. Part of what makes Earth so amenable is its natural greenhouse effect, which maintains an average temperature of 15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F) . However, in the last century, human activities, primarily from burning fossil fuels that have led to the release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, have disrupted Earth's energy balance. This has led to an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and ocean. The level of carbon dioxide in Earth\u2019s atmosphere has been rising consistently for decades and traps extra heat near Earth's surface, causing temperatures to rise.\nREAD MORE\nExplore Earth Science\nNASA's unique vantage point helps us inform solutions to enhance decision-making, improve livelihoods, and protect our planet.\nEarth Science Data\nFacts About Earth\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

For ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nGreenhouse gases (GHGs) warm the Earth by absorbing energy and slowing the rate at which the energy escapes to space; they act like a blanket insulating the Earth. Different GHGs can have different effects on the Earth's warming. Two key ways in which these gases differ from each other are their ability to absorb energy (their \"radiative efficiency\"), and how long they stay in the atmosphere (also known as their \"lifetime\").\nStarting in 1990, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (pdf)Exit EPA\u2019s website has used the Global Warming Potential (GWP) to allow comparisons of the global warming impacts of different gases. Specifically, the GWP is a measure of how much energy the emission of 1 ton of a gas will absorb over a given period of time, relative to the emission of 1 ton of carbon dioxide (CO2). The larger the GWP, the more that a given gas warms the Earth compared to CO2 over that time period. The time period usually used for GWPs is 100 years.\nGWPs provide a common unit of measure, which allows analysts to add up emissions estimates of different gases (e.g., to compile a national GHG inventory), and allows policymakers to compare emissions reduction opportunities across sectors and gases.\nLearn more about the main GHGs on our Overview page. Explore the questions and answers below to learn more about global warming potentials (GWPs).\nThe International Organization for Standardization (ISO) community differs in its definition and use of the term Global Warming Potential (GWP) from that used by IPCC (pdf)Exit EPA\u2019s website. This ISO approach is applied in Environmental Production Declaration (EPD), Product Category Rules (PCR), Buy Clean Policies, and related programs. This definition and use are inconsistent with how GWP is defined by the IPCC and used in many international GHG accounting efforts, including national reporting by Parties to the UNFCCC and Paris Agreement.\nThe ISO and relevant communities use the term \u201cGWP\u201d as an impact category to refer to the embodied greenhouse gases of a specific product or product-level GHG emission intensities (see, e.g., ISO 21930:2017). This specific use of GWP by the EPD community refers to the total greenhouse gas emissions directly associated with the production of a product, including the upstream activities of extraction and transport of raw materials. This type of calculation can also be described with terms such as \u201cembodied GHG equivalent\u201d or \u201cGHG footprint.\u201d The product GWP measure is reported in CO2-equivalents per functional unit in EPDs, PCRs, etc. However, the ISO calculation of CO2-equivalents requires the use of the original GWP as defined by IPCC, thereby making the EPD/ISO GWP inherently confusing as it uses both meanings of the term GWP simultaneously.\nTo reduce confusion, the use of the term \u201cGlobal Warming Potential\u201d or \u201cGWP\u201d that fall outside the IPCC definition or use\u2014i.e., a measure of the relative climate impact of a given greenhouse gas relative to the impact of carbon dioxide (as defined on this page)\u2014should include a definition of the non-IPCC usage of the term to distinguish it from the original established IPCC definition. In the case of how ISO and relevant communities use the term GWP, it should be clearly explained that the specific meaning in that context refers to \u201cembodied GHG equivalent,\u201d \u201cembodied GHG emissions,\u201d or \u201ccarbon equivalent footprint,\u201d as applicable. This context is especially important if the document uses both different meanings of the term \u201cGWP\u201d such as in the ISO/EPD context.\nEPA and other organizations will update the GWP values they use occasionally. This change can be due to updated scientific estimates of the energy absorption or lifetime of the gases or to changing atmospheric concentrations of GHGs that result in a change in the energy absorption of 1 additional ton of a gas relative to another.\nIn the most recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), multiple methods of calculating GWPs were presented based on how to account for the influence of future warming on the carbon cycle. For this web page, we are presenting the range of the lowest to the highest values listed by the IPCC.\nEPA considers the GWP estimates presented in the most recent IPCC scientific assessment to reflect the state of the science. In science communications, EPA will refer to the most recent GWPs. The GWPs listed above are from the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report, published in 2021.\nEPA's Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks (Inventory) complies with international GHG reporting standards under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). UNFCCC guidelines now require the use of the GWP values from the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), published in 2013. The Inventory also presents emissions by mass, so that CO2 equivalents can be calculated using any GWPs, and emission totals using more recent IPCC values are presented in the annexes of the Inventory report for informational purposes.\nThe data collected by EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is generally reported in mass units of greenhouse gas and is used in the Inventory. The Reporting Program generally uses GWP values from the IPCC\u2019s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) to determine whether facilities exceed reporting thresholds and to publish data in CO2 equivalent values. The Reporting Program collects data about some industrial gases that do not have GWPs listed in the AR4; for these gases, the Reporting Program uses GWP values from other sources, such as the AR5.\nEPA's CH4 reduction voluntary programs also use CH4 GWPs from the AR5 report for calculating CH4 emissions reductions through energy recovery projects, for consistency with the national emissions presented in the Inventory.\nThe United States primarily uses the 100-year GWP as a measure of the relative impact of different GHGs. However, the scientific community has develo\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This definition and use are inconsistent with how GWP is defined by the IPCC and used in many international GHG accounting efforts, including national reporting by Parties to the UNFCCC and Paris Agreement.\nThe ISO and relevant communities use the term \u201cGWP\u201d as an impact category to refer to the embodied greenhouse gases of a specific product or product-level GHG emission intensities (see, e.g., ISO 21930:2017). This specific use of GWP by the EPD community refers to the total greenhouse gas emissions directly associated with the production of a product, including the upstream activities of extraction and transport of raw materials. This type of calculation can also be described with terms such as \u201cembodied GHG equivalent\u201d or \u201cGHG footprint.\u201d The product GWP measure is reported in CO2-equivalents per functional unit in EPDs, PCRs, etc. However, the ISO calculation of CO2-equivalents requires the use of the original GWP as defined by IPCC, thereby making the EPD/ISO GWP inherently confusing as it uses both meanings of the term GWP simultaneously.\nTo reduce confusion, the use of the term \u201cGlobal Warming Potential\u201d or \u201cGWP\u201d that fall outside the IPCC definition or use\u2014i.e., a measure of the relative climate impact of a given greenhouse gas relative to the impact of carbon dioxide (as defined on this page)\u2014should include a definition of the non-IPCC usage of the term to distinguish it from the original established IPCC definition. In the case of how ISO and relevant communities use the term GWP, it should be clearly explained that the specific meaning in that context refers to \u201cembodied GHG equivalent,\u201d \u201cembodied GHG emissions,\u201d or \u201ccarbon equivalent footprint,\u201d as applicable. This context is especially important if the document uses both different meanings of the term \u201cGWP\u201d such as in the ISO/EPD context.\nEPA and other organizations will update the GWP values they use occasionally. This change can be due to updated scientific estimates of the energy absorption or lifetime of the gases or to changing atmospheric concentrations of GHGs that result in a change in the energy absorption of 1 additional ton of a gas relative to another.\nIn the most recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), multiple methods of calculating GWPs were presented based on how to account for the influence of future warming on the carbon cycle. For this web page, we are presenting the range of the lowest to the highest values listed by the IPCC.\nEPA considers the GWP estimates presented in the most recent IPCC scientific assessment to reflect the state of the science. In science communications, EPA will refer to the most recent GWPs. The GWPs listed above are from the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report, published in 2021.\nEPA's Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks (Inventory) complies with international GHG reporting standards under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). UNFCCC guidelines now require the use of the GWP values from the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), published in 2013. The Inventory also presents emissions by mass, so that CO2 equivalents can be calculated using any GWPs, and emission totals using more recent IPCC values are presented in the annexes of the Inventory report for informational purposes.\nThe data collected by EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is generally reported in mass units of greenhouse gas and is used in the Inventory. The Reporting Program generally uses GWP values from the IPCC\u2019s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) to determine whether facilities exceed reporting thresholds and to publish data in CO2 equivalent values. The Reporting Program collects data about some industrial gases that do not have GWPs listed in the AR4; for these gases, the Reporting Program uses GWP values from other sources, such as the AR5.\nEPA's CH4 reduction voluntary programs also use CH4 GWPs from the AR5 report for calculating CH4 emissions reductions through energy recovery projects, for consistency with the national emissions presented in the Inventory.\nThe United States primarily uses the 100-year GWP as a measure of the relative impact of different GHGs. However, the scientific community has develo\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Since carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, this increase has warmed the planet.\n430ppm\nJune 2025\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) is an important greenhouse gas. Greenhouse gases trap the heat from sunlight, warming the planet. Without any greenhouse gases, Earth would be too cold to support life. But the more greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere, the warmer the planet becomes.\nCarbon dioxide comes from sources such as the burning of fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, and natural gas), wildfires, and volcanic eruptions. The graph shows atmospheric CO2 levels measured by NOAA at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, since 1958. It's important to note that \u201cparts per million\u201d refers to the number of carbon dioxide molecules per million molecules of dry air. The data shown are the latest available, updated monthly.\nThe second animated graph shows CO2 levels from an Antarctic ice core in combination with the observations from Mauna Loa Observatory. This extends the record back through Earth\u2019s last three glacial cycles. The Antarctic ice core measures CO2 levels trapped in tiny air bubbles from the past that were preserved when the ice formed.\nGround-based and satellite measurements have measured a sharp increase in atmospheric CO2 in recent decades. With a more than 50% increase in CO2 since the start of industrial times in the 18th century, scientific measurements have linked this increase primarily to the burning of coal, oil, and gas. This means that CO2 levels are now 150% the value they were at in 1750 \u2014 this is at least 1.5 times greater than the natural increase observed at the end of the last ice age 20,000 years ago, which happened over thousands of years.\nThe animated map below shows the historical changes in global carbon dioxide over time. Note the colors change as the amount of CO2 rises from 365 parts per million (ppm) in 2002 to over 420 ppm in 2022. These measurements from the AIRS instrument come from the mid-troposphere, the layer of Earth's atmosphere that is 8 to 12 kilometers (about 5 to 7 miles) above the ground.\nA closer look at the carbon dioxide measurements at Mauna Loa shows a series of wiggles in the data. Although total CO2 is increasing each year, there is also a short-term cycle visible within the larger trend.\nThis annual rise and fall of CO2 levels is caused by seasonal cycles in photosynthesis on a global scale. In Northern Hemisphere spring, plants come to life and draw in CO2 to fuel their growth. This begins the process of lowering the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. In northern autumn, plant growth stops or slows down, and the whole process reverses itself. Much of the plant matter decomposes, releasing CO2 back to the atmosphere.\nA similar but less intense pattern repeats in the Southern Hemisphere in opposite seasons. Spring growth starts in September and winter decomposition begins in March, so CO2 records in the Southern Hemisphere show the opposite pattern of that seen in Mauna Loa. However, because there is a lot more land and vegetation in the Northern Hemisphere than the southern, the global yearly cycle more closely aligns with the northern seasons.\nSee the cycle in action in the visualization Watching Earth Breathe: The Seasonal Vegetation Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide.\nThis cycle of plant growth gives the graph of CO2 a sawtooth pattern of ups and downs from year to year. At a larger scale, the upward climb of the trend line over the decades is caused by CO2 emissions, primarily from burning fossil fuels. Thus, the data illustrate both natural factors and human additions of CO2.\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Virtually all climate scientists agree that this increase in heat-trapping gases is the main reason for the 1.8\u00b0F (1.0\u00b0C) rise in global average temperature since the late nineteenth century. Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, and various chlorofluorocarbons are all human-emitted heat-trapping gases. Among these, carbon dioxide is of greatest concern to scientists because it exerts a larger overall warming influence than the other gases combined.\nSteam billows from the Intermountain Power Plant in Delta, Utah.

Since carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, this increase has warmed the planet.\n430ppm\nJune 2025\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) is an important greenhouse gas. Greenhouse gases trap the heat from sunlight, warming the planet. Without any greenhouse gases, Earth would be too cold to support life. But the more greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere, the warmer the planet becomes.\nCarbon dioxide comes from sources such as the burning of fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, and natural gas), wildfires, and volcanic eruptions. The graph shows atmospheric CO2 levels measured by NOAA at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, since 1958. It's important to note that \u201cparts per million\u201d refers to the number of carbon dioxide molecules per million molecules of dry air. The data shown are the latest available, updated monthly.\nThe second animated graph shows CO2 levels from an Antarctic ice core in combination with the observations from Mauna Loa Observatory. This extends the record back through Earth\u2019s last three glacial cycles. The Antarctic ice core measures CO2 levels trapped in tiny air bubbles from the past that were preserved when the ice formed.\nGround-based and satellite measurements have measured a sharp increase in atmospheric CO2 in recent decades. With a more than 50% increase in CO2 since the start of industrial times in the 18th century, scientific measurements have linked this increase primarily to the burning of coal, oil, and gas. This means that CO2 levels are now 150% the value they were at in 1750 \u2014 this is at least 1.5 times greater than the natural increase observed at the end of the last ice age 20,000 years ago, which happened over thousands of years.\nThe animated map below shows the historical changes in global carbon dioxide over time. Note the colors change as the amount of CO2 rises from 365 parts per million (ppm) in 2002 to over 420 ppm in 2022. These measurements from the AIRS instrument come from the mid-troposphere, the layer of Earth's atmosphere that is 8 to 12 kilometers (about 5 to 7 miles) above the ground.\nA closer look at the carbon dioxide measurements at Mauna Loa shows a series of wiggles in the data. Although total CO2 is increasing each year, there is also a short-term cycle visible within the larger trend.\nThis annual rise and fall of CO2 levels is caused by seasonal cycles in photosynthesis on a global scale. In Northern Hemisphere spring, plants come to life and draw in CO2 to fuel their growth. This begins the process of lowering the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. In northern autumn, plant growth stops or slows down, and the whole process reverses itself. Much of the plant matter decomposes, releasing CO2 back to the atmosphere.\nA similar but less intense pattern repeats in the Southern Hemisphere in opposite seasons. Spring growth starts in September and winter decomposition begins in March, so CO2 records in the Southern Hemisphere show the opposite pattern of that seen in Mauna Loa. However, because there is a lot more land and vegetation in the Northern Hemisphere than the southern, the global yearly cycle more closely aligns with the northern seasons.\nSee the cycle in action in the visualization Watching Earth Breathe: The Seasonal Vegetation Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide.\nThis cycle of plant growth gives the graph of CO2 a sawtooth pattern of ups and downs from year to year. At a larger scale, the upward climb of the trend line over the decades is caused by CO2 emissions, primarily from burning fossil fuels. Thus, the data illustrate both natural factors and human additions of CO2.\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Luthi ... 1800s, and is proceeding at a rate not seen over many recent millennia.\n\nFull Page Content:\nThere is unequivocal evidence that Earth is warming at an unprecedented rate. Human activity is the principal cause.\nEarth's climate has changed throughout history. Just in the last 800,000 years, there have been eight cycles of ice ages and warmer periods, with the end of the last ice age about 11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era \u2014 and of human civilization. Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth\u2019s orbit that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives.\nThe current warming trend is different because it is clearly the result of human activities since the mid-1800s, and is proceeding at a rate not seen over many recent millennia.1 It is undeniable that human activities have produced the atmospheric gases that have trapped more of the Sun\u2019s energy in the Earth system. This extra energy has warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land, and widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred.\nEarth-orbiting satellites and new technologies have helped scientists see the big picture, collecting many different types of information about our planet and its climate all over the world. These data, collected over many years, reveal the signs and patterns of a changing climate.\nScientists demonstrated the heat-trapping nature of carbon dioxide and other gases in the mid-19th century.2 Many of the science instruments NASA uses to study our climate focus on how these gases affect the movement of infrared radiation through the atmosphere. From the measured impacts of increases in these gases, there is no question that increased greenhouse gas levels warm Earth in response.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nIce cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that Earth\u2019s climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly 10 times faster than the average rate of warming after an ice age. Carbon dioxide from human activities is increasing about 250 times faster than it did from natural sources after the last Ice Age.3\nThe planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and other human activities.4 Most of the warming occurred in the past 40 years, with the seven most recent years being the warmest. The years 2016 and 2020 are tied for the warmest year on record.5 Image credit: Ashwin Kumar, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic.\nThe ocean has absorbed much of this increased heat, with the top 100 meters (about 328 feet) of ocean showing warming of 0.67 degrees Fahrenheit (0.33 degrees Celsius) since 1969.6 Earth stores 90% of the extra energy in the ocean. Image credit: Kelsey Roberts/USGS\nThe Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass. Data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment show Greenland lost an average of 279 billion tons of ice per year between 1993 and 2019, while Antarctica lost about 148 billion tons of ice per year.7 Image: The Antarctic Peninsula, Credit: NASA\nGlaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world \u2014 including in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska, and Africa.8 Image: Miles Glacier, Alaska Image credit: NASA\nSatellite observations reveal that the amount of spring snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere has decreased over the past five decades and the snow is melting earlier.9 Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\nGlobal sea level rose about 8 inches (20 centimeters) in the last century.

Even if it\u2019s something you don\u2019t think about often, like air conditioning or refrigeration, you'd likely miss it if it were gone.\nMany products you use have hidden environmental costs, and some generate huge quantities of greenhouse gases. Every step in the life cycle of a product leaves a mark. Emissions can occur as raw materials are extracted and processed in factories, packaged, and then shipped. Even after you\u2019ve bought something, its harm to the climate could continue through the electricity it uses to operate, the power needed to run it through the wash, or the waste it generates once it's discarded.\nBut what exactly are greenhouse gases, and why do they have such a profound effect on Earth\u2019s climate? Understanding how greenhouse gases originate and how to measure their effects on the climate is crucial for tackling the biggest environmental challenge of our time. In this resource, you\u2019ll learn how everyday actions and choices can help or hurt our planet.\nHumans have dramatically changed the atmosphere over the past few centuries, mainly by releasing vast amounts of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2). That story begins in the 1700s with the Industrial Revolution, a time when human society began to change rapidly. Before that period, economies relied largely on agriculture. Most finished products were produced slowly and laboriously by skilled artisans. Human activity still produced greenhouse gases, but at much lower levels.\nEverything shifted when new manufacturing processes and machines, like the steam engine, arrived on the scene. To power growing industries, societies needed to burn fuel, and lots of it. Increasingly, that fuel came in the form of coal.\nA painting from 1855 of the Burmeister and Wain iron foundry in Copenhagen, Denmark.\nSource: Peder Severin Kroye via Statens Museum for Kunst\nCoal was a game changer because it was relatively packed with energy (around three times as much energy as the same amount of wood), and it was relatively easy to access. When burned, coal could efficiently power the new steam engines that drove factories, trains, and ships, allowing industries to grow like never before. Coal use set off a chain reaction: factories popped up everywhere, cities expanded, and people began moving in huge numbers to urban areas for work. That sparked the beginning of a global shift toward using fossil fuels\u2014coal, oil, and natural gas\u2014to power nearly every aspect of modern life.\nToday, those fuels are the backbone of modern society. However, burning fossil fuels releases CO2 into the atmosphere. How does that happen? Well, fossil fuels are formed from the remains of ancient plants and animals buried deep in the earth\u2014most of which are composed of carbon. Over millions of years, heat and pressure turned those remains into energy-rich substances. So, when people burn those fuels for energy, they are sending CO2, which was once trapped underground, into the atmosphere. The CO2 then traps heat from the sun in the atmosphere, making the earth warmer\u2014a process known as the greenhouse effect.\nAlthough fossil fuels are the main culprits, other human activity is driving climate change too. Cutting down forests and developing land has led to more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Also, as the world modernizes and grows wealthier, diets have changed, too. With more people able to afford meat, the demand for farm-raised animals like cows and sheep has soared. However, those animals release methane (CH4)\u2014a greenhouse gas even more potent than CO2\u2014during digestion. Plus, fertilizers that farmers use to grow more food releases nitrous oxide (N2O), another heat-trapping gas.\nCattle ranchers herd their cows in Miranda, Brazil in 2023.\nSource: Universal Images / Getty Images\nOn top of that, some newer technologies meant to improve human lives also contribute to the problem. Air conditioning and refrigeration, among other modern conveniences, rely on fluorinated gases to run. Those gases were designed as safer replacements for chemicals that damaged the ozone layer. However, they are extremely effective at trapping heat\u2014more than ten thousand times stronger than CO2. As those appliances have become more widespread, the use of fluorinated gases has surged.\nAlthough carbon dioxide is the most common greenhouse gas, it isn't the strongest at trapping heat. Gases like methane and nitrous oxide are much better at holding in heat from the sun. Some can linger in the atmosphere for a long time, making them even more powerful in warming the planet.\nFor each greenhouse gas, scientists calculate its global warming potential (GWP). That measure factors in how much heat a gas can trap and how long it stays in the atmosphere. The GWP score is essentially a comparison to carbon dioxide\u2019s role in global warming.\nDifferent human activities release different greenhouse gases in varying amounts. So, leaders need to consider the GWP of the gases their climate policies would regulate. If they are trying to keep the world from warming by more than a certain degree, they need to know which gases to limit by how much.\nHumans produce greenhouse gases through a wide range of activities. To help track them all, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) divides them up into five primary sectors: energy, industry, agriculture and land use, transportation, and buildings.\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at each of the categories.\nEnergy: The world depends on electricity for nearly everything\u2014charging devices, runni\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

However, recent climate changes cannot be explained by natural causes alone.\nChanges in the earth\u2019s orbit and its axis of rotation have had a big impact on climate in the past. For example, the amount of summer sunshine on the Northern Hemisphere, which is affected by changes in the planet\u2019s orbit, appears to be the primary cause of past cycles of ice ages, in which the earth has experienced long periods of cold temperatures (ice ages), as well as shorter interglacial periods (periods between ice ages) of relatively warmer temperatures.1 At the coldest part of the last glacial period (or ice age), the average global temperature was about 11\u00b0F colder than it is today. At the peak of the last interglacial period, however, the average global temperature was at most 2\u00b0F warmer than it is today.2\nChanges in the sun\u2019s energy output can affect the intensity of the sunlight that reaches the earth\u2019s surface. While these changes can influence the earth\u2019s climate, solar variations have played little role in the climate changes observed in recent decades.3 Satellites have been measuring the amount of energy the earth receives from the sun since 1978. These measurements show no net increase in the sun\u2019s output, even as global surface temperatures have risen.4\nThe amount of sunlight that is absorbed or reflected by the planet depends on the earth\u2019s surface and atmosphere. Dark objects and surfaces, like the ocean, forests, and soil, tend to absorb more sunlight. Light-colored objects and surfaces, like snow and clouds, tend to reflect sunlight. About 70 percent of the sunlight that reaches the earth is absorbed.5 Natural changes in the earth\u2019s surface, like the melting of sea ice, have contributed to climate change in the past, often acting as feedbacks to other processes.\nVolcanoes have played a noticeable role in climate, and volcanic eruptions released large quantities of carbon dioxide in the distant past. Some explosive volcano eruptions can throw particles (e.g., SO2) into the upper atmosphere, where they can reflect enough sunlight back to space to cool the surface of the planet for several years.6 These particles are an example of cooling aerosols.\nVolcanic particles from a single eruption do not produce long-term climate change because they remain in the atmosphere for a much shorter time than greenhouse gases. In addition, human activities emit more than 100 times as much carbon dioxide as volcanoes each year.7\nOver the last several hundred thousand years, carbon dioxide levels varied in tandem with the glacial cycles. During warm interglacial periods, carbon dioxide levels were higher. During cool glacial periods, carbon dioxide levels were lower.8 The heating or cooling of the earth\u2019s surface and oceans can cause changes in the natural sources and sinks of these gases, and thus change greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.9 These changing concentrations have acted as a positive climate feedback, amplifying the temperature changes caused by long-term shifts in the earth\u2019s orbit.10\n1 National Academy of Sciences.

This extends the record back through Earth\u2019s last three glacial cycles. The Antarctic ice core measures CO2 levels trapped in tiny air bubbles from the past that were preserved when the ice formed.\nGround-based and satellite measurements have measured a sharp increase in atmospheric CO2 in recent decades. With a more than 50% increase in CO2 since the start of industrial times in the 18th century, scientific measurements have linked this increase primarily to the burning of coal, oil, and gas. This means that CO2 levels are now 150% the value they were at in 1750 \u2014 this is at least 1.5 times greater than the natural increase observed at the end of the last ice age 20,000 years ago, which happened over thousands of years.\nThe animated map below shows the historical changes in global carbon dioxide over time. Note the colors change as the amount of CO2 rises from 365 parts per million (ppm) in 2002 to over 420 ppm in 2022. These measurements from the AIRS instrument come from the mid-troposphere, the layer of Earth's atmosphere that is 8 to 12 kilometers (about 5 to 7 miles) above the ground.\nA closer look at the carbon dioxide measurements at Mauna Loa shows a series of wiggles in the data. Although total CO2 is increasing each year, there is also a short-term cycle visible within the larger trend.\nThis annual rise and fall of CO2 levels is caused by seasonal cycles in photosynthesis on a global scale. In Northern Hemisphere spring, plants come to life and draw in CO2 to fuel their growth. This begins the process of lowering the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. In northern autumn, plant growth stops or slows down, and the whole process reverses itself. Much of the plant matter decomposes, releasing CO2 back to the atmosphere.\nA similar but less intense pattern repeats in the Southern Hemisphere in opposite seasons. Spring growth starts in September and winter decomposition begins in March, so CO2 records in the Southern Hemisphere show the opposite pattern of that seen in Mauna Loa.

Greenhouse gases trap the heat from sunlight, warming the planet. Without any greenhouse gases, Earth would be too cold to support life. But the more greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere, the warmer the planet becomes.\nCarbon dioxide comes from sources such as the burning of fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, and natural gas), wildfires, and volcanic eruptions.

With a more than 50% increase in CO2 since the start of industrial times in the 18th century, scientific measurements have linked this increase primarily to the burning of coal, oil, and gas. This means that CO2 levels are now 150% the value they were at in 1750 \u2014 this is at least 1.5 times greater than the natural increase observed at the end of the last ice age 20,000 years ago, which happened over thousands of years.\nThe animated map below shows the historical changes in global carbon dioxide over time. Note the colors change as the amount of CO2 rises from 365 parts per million (ppm) in 2002 to over 420 ppm in 2022. These measurements from the AIRS instrument come from the mid-troposphere, the layer of Earth's atmosphere that is 8 to 12 kilometers (about 5 to 7 miles) above the ground.\nA closer look at the carbon dioxide measurements at Mauna Loa shows a series of wiggles in the data. Although total CO2 is increasing each year, there is also a short-term cycle visible within the larger trend.\nThis annual rise and fall of CO2 levels is caused by seasonal cycles in photosynthesis on a global scale. In Northern Hemisphere spring, plants come to life and draw in CO2 to fuel their growth. This begins the process of lowering the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. In northern autumn, plant growth stops or slows down, and the whole process reverses itself. Much of the plant matter decomposes, releasing CO2 back to the atmosphere.\nA similar but less intense pattern repeats in the Southern Hemisphere in opposite seasons. Spring growth starts in September and winter decomposition begins in March, so CO2 records in the Southern Hemisphere show the opposite pattern of that seen in Mauna Loa. However, because there is a lot more land and vegetation in the Northern Hemisphere than the southern, the global yearly cycle more closely aligns with the northern seasons.\nSee the cycle in action in the visualization Watching Earth Breathe: The Seasonal Vegetation Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide.\nThis cycle of plant growth gives the graph of CO2 a sawtooth pattern of ups and downs from year to year.

Carbon dioxide from human activities is increasing about 250 times faster than it did from natural sources after the last Ice Age.3\nThe planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and other human activities.4 Most of the warming occurred in the past 40 years, with the seven most recent years being the warmest.

Data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment show Greenland lost an average of 279 billion tons of ice per year between 1993 and 2019, while Antarctica lost about 148 billion tons of ice per year.7 Image: The Antarctic Peninsula, Credit: NASA\nGlaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world \u2014 including in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska, and Africa.8 Image: Miles Glacier, Alaska Image credit: NASA\nSatellite observations reveal that the amount of spring snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere has decreased over the past five decades and the snow is melting earlier.9 Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\nGlobal sea level rose about 8 inches (20 centimeters) in the last century.

The Greenland ice sheet alone has the potential to raise global sea levels by an astonishing 23 feet were it to melt away completely. Slowing the rate of ice loss is therefore of utmost concern not only for coastal communities, but to avoid shocks to global economies, infrastructure, military installations, and the livelihoods of billions of people. Some experts now propose that sea level rise should be a policy metric in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\nThis spring, the Belfer Center\u2019s Arctic Initiative, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and Rethink Energy Florida co-hosted a webinar on the status of Greenland\u2019s ice sheet, the implications for the United States and the world, and opportunities to slow down future melting and sea level rise.\nRead on for key takeaways identified by the panelists, Sarah Das, Polar and Climate Scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; Rafe Pomerance, Senior Policy Fellow at Woodwell Climate Research Center; and Margaret Williams, Senior Fellow at the Belfer Center\u2019s Arctic Initiative.\nThe Greenland ice sheet loses mass mainly through melting and calving processes. Melting of Greenland\u2019s ice sheet and glaciers is increasing in response to warming from above and below. As global air temperatures rise\u2014something that is happening fastest in the Arctic\u2014warm air over the ice sheet exposes more areas to melting temperatures. In addition, atmospheric warming is also raising ocean temperatures, and there are signs that warm ocean currents around Greenland are melting back the submerged front of many glaciers there.\nArctic warming also results in changes to ice dynamics, affecting the speed at which glaciers move from the interior of the ice sheet towards the coast. Meltwater on the surface can flow to the bottom of the ice sheet through cracks and holes, resulting in the ice sheet sliding more quickly over its bed towards the sea. Increased calving rates reduce mass and can also further increase movement along the ice sheet margin, as loss of ice around the edges of the ice sheet diminishes the forces holding back ice further in the interior.\nCurrently, southern Greenland is losing ice the fastest\u2014about 234 billion tons per year. Overall, Greenland is melting about seven times faster than it was 30 years ago.\nThere are several reasons why the Arctic is warming faster. One of the most influential is that as sea ice melts, it exposes darker ocean water beneath, which has a lower albedo (reflectivity) than ice, leading to increased absorption of solar radiation and further warming. This process creates a self-reinforcing cycle where reduced Arctic sea ice cover accelerates warming, contributing to more ice melt and so on.\nThe melting of Greenland's ice sheet has far-reaching consequences for global climate stability and human well-being, one of the most important being its contribution to global sea level rise. This contributes to increased rates of coastal flooding and inundation worldwide, posing a threat to approximately 90 million people in the United States alone, and hundreds of millions of people worldwide. In addition, flooding associated with rising sea level creates health risks, for example by contaminating water supplies and promoting the spread of waterborne diseases. The costs of all of these impacts are substantial, as businesses, governments, and individuals are forced to invest in infrastructure and property protection and adaptation measures.\nResearch indicates that the melting of Greenland\u2019s ice sheet and the influx of fresh water into the ocean may also be contributing to the slowing of important ocean currents that distribute heat around the planet, even in the Southern Hemisphere. Changes to the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), also known as the \u201cglobal ocean conveyer belt,\u201d could mean colder climates for Europe, drier conditions in the tropics, and wetter, warmer weather patterns in the Southern Hemisphere. Disruptions in major ocean currents also impact marine ecosystems, including commercially valuable fisheries. Changing ocean currents also alter regional climates and contribute to changes in extreme weather events such as droughts and floods. All of these impacts, from sea level rise, weather and climate, and food security, have important consequences for global economic stability.\nGlobal sea level rise is primarily a result of increased melting of glaciers and ice sheets worldwide, as well as warming ocean temperatures causing seawater to expand in volume, in a process called thermal expansion.\nThe Greenland ice sheet is responsible for 20 percent of current sea level rise. The IPCC projects that by 2100, Greenland could contribute 3.1 to 10.6 inches (8 to 27 cm) to global sea level, and the melting of Antarctic ice may add another 1.2 to 11 inches (3 to 28 cm). Predictions of future sea level rise must take many factors into consideration.\nCoastal erosion and loss of sediment from increased storms and land use changes can also amplify the impacts of coastal flooding on communities and ecosystems.\nIn many coastal regions, the rate of sea level rise is greater than the global average due to regional and local processes.

However, recent climate changes cannot be explained by natural causes alone.\nChanges in the earth\u2019s orbit and its axis of rotation have had a big impact on climate in the past. For example, the amount of summer sunshine on the Northern Hemisphere, which is affected by changes in the planet\u2019s orbit, appears to be the primary cause of past cycles of ice ages, in which the earth has experienced long periods of cold temperatures (ice ages), as well as shorter interglacial periods (periods between ice ages) of relatively warmer temperatures.1 At the coldest part of the last glacial period (or ice age), the average global temperature was about 11\u00b0F colder than it is today. At the peak of the last interglacial period, however, the average global temperature was at most 2\u00b0F warmer than it is today.2\nChanges in the sun\u2019s energy output can affect the intensity of the sunlight that reaches the earth\u2019s surface. While these changes can influence the earth\u2019s climate, solar variations have played little role in the climate changes observed in recent decades.3 Satellites have been measuring the amount of energy the earth receives from the sun since 1978. These measurements show no net increase in the sun\u2019s output, even as global surface temperatures have risen.4\nThe amount of sunlight that is absorbed or reflected by the planet depends on the earth\u2019s surface and atmosphere. Dark objects and surfaces, like the ocean, forests, and soil, tend to absorb more sunlight. Light-colored objects and surfaces, like snow and clouds, tend to reflect sunlight. About 70 percent of the sunlight that reaches the earth is absorbed.5 Natural changes in the earth\u2019s surface, like the melting of sea ice, have contributed to climate change in the past, often acting as feedbacks to other processes.\nVolcanoes have played a noticeable role in climate, and volcanic eruptions released large quantities of carbon dioxide in the distant past. Some explosive volcano eruptions can throw particles (e.g., SO2) into the upper atmosphere, where they can reflect enough sunlight back to space to cool the surface of the planet for several years.6 These particles are an example of cooling aerosols.\nVolcanic particles from a single eruption do not produce long-term climate change because they remain in the atmosphere for a much shorter time than greenhouse gases. In addition, human activities emit more than 100 times as much carbon dioxide as volcanoes each year.7\nOver the last several hundred thousand years, carbon dioxide levels varied in tandem with the glacial cycles. During warm interglacial periods, carbon dioxide levels were higher. During cool glacial periods, carbon dioxide levels were lower.8 The heating or cooling of the earth\u2019s surface and oceans can cause changes in the natural sources and sinks of these gases, and thus change greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.9 These changing concentrations have acted as a positive climate feedback, amplifying the temperature changes caused by long-term shifts in the earth\u2019s orbit.10\n1 National Academy of Sciences.

Virtually all climate scientists agree that this increase in heat-trapping gases is the main reason for the 1.8\u00b0F (1.0\u00b0C) rise in global average temperature since the late nineteenth century. Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, and various chlorofluorocarbons are all human-emitted heat-trapping gases. Among these, carbon dioxide is of greatest concern to scientists because it exerts a larger overall warming influence than the other gases combined.\nSteam billows from the Intermountain Power Plant in Delta, Utah.

Of this human-produced carbon, forests and other vegetation absorb around 3.2 billion metric tons per year, while the ocean absorbs about 2.5 billion metric tons per year. A net 5 billion metric tons of human-produced carbon remain in the atmosphere each year, raising the global average carbon dioxide concentrations by about 2.3 parts per million per year.

Human activity is the principal cause.\nEarth's climate has changed throughout history. Just in the last 800,000 years, there have been eight cycles of ice ages and warmer periods, with the end of the last ice age about 11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era \u2014 and of human civilization. Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth\u2019s orbit that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives.\nThe current warming trend is different because it is clearly the result of human activities since the mid-1800s, and is proceeding at a rate not seen over many recent millennia.1 It is undeniable that human activities have produced the atmospheric gases that have trapped more of the Sun\u2019s energy in the Earth system. This extra energy has warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land, and widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred.\nEarth-orbiting satellites and new technologies have helped scientists see the big picture, collecting many different types of information about our planet and its climate all over the world. These data, collected over many years, reveal the signs and patterns of a changing climate.\nScientists demonstrated the heat-trapping nature of carbon dioxide and other gases in the mid-19th century.2 Many of the science instruments NASA uses to study our climate focus on how these gases affect the movement of infrared radiation through the atmosphere. From the measured impacts of increases in these gases, there is no question that increased greenhouse gas levels warm Earth in response.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nIce cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that Earth\u2019s climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly 10 times faster than the average rate of warming after an ice age. Carbon dioxide from human activities is increasing about 250 times faster than it did from natural sources after the last Ice Age.3\nThe planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and other human activities.4 Most of the warming occurred in the past 40 years, with the seven most recent years being the warmest. The years 2016 and 2020 are tied for the warmest year on record.5 Image credit: Ashwin Kumar, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic.\nThe ocean has absorbed much of this increased heat, with the top 100 meters (about 328 feet) of ocean showing warming of 0.67 degrees Fahrenheit (0.33 degrees Celsius) since 1969.6 Earth stores 90% of the extra energy in the ocean. Image credit: Kelsey Roberts/USGS\nThe Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass. Data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment show Greenland lost an average of 279 billion tons of ice per year between 1993 and 2019, while Antarctica lost about 148 billion tons of ice per year.7 Image: The Antarctic Peninsula, Credit: NASA\nGlaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world \u2014 including in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska, and Africa.8 Image: Miles Glacier, Alaska Image credit: NASA\nSatellite observations reveal that the amount of spring snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere has decreased over the past five decades and the snow is melting earlier.9 Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\nGlobal sea level rose about 8 inches (20 centimeters) in the last century.

Imagine these gases as a cozy blanket enveloping our planet, helping to maintain a warmer temperature than it would have otherwise. Greenhouse gases consist of carbon dioxide, methane, ozone, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons, and water vapor. Water vapor, which reacts to temperature changes, is referred to as a 'feedback', because it amplifies the effect of forces that initially caused the warming.\nScientists have determined that carbon dioxide plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability of Earth's atmosphere. If carbon dioxide were removed, the terrestrial greenhouse effect would collapse, and Earth's surface temperature would drop significantly, by approximately 33\u00b0C (59\u00b0F).\nGreenhouse gases are part of Earth's atmosphere. This is why Earth is often called the 'Goldilocks' planet \u2013 its conditions are just right, not too hot or too cold, allowing life to thrive. Part of what makes Earth so amenable is its natural greenhouse effect, which maintains an average temperature of 15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F) . However, in the last century, human activities, primarily from burning fossil fuels that have led to the release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, have disrupted Earth's energy balance. This has led to an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and ocean. The level of carbon dioxide in Earth\u2019s atmosphere has been rising consistently for decades and traps extra heat near Earth's surface, causing temperatures to rise.\nREAD MORE\nExplore Earth Science\nNASA's unique vantage point helps us inform solutions to enhance decision-making, improve livelihoods, and protect our planet.\nEarth Science Data\nFacts About Earth\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

It is an average of 1.67 km (1.0 mi) thick and over 3 km (1.9 mi) thick at its maximum.[2] It is almost 2,900 kilometres (1,800 mi) long in a north\u2013south direction, with a maximum width of 1,100 kilometres (680 mi) at a latitude of 77\u00b0N, near its northern edge.[1] The ice sheet covers 1,710,000 square kilometres (660,000 sq mi), around 80% of the surface of Greenland, or about 12% of the area of the Antarctic ice sheet.[2] The term 'Greenland ice sheet' is often shortened to GIS or GrIS in scientific literature.[3][4][5][6]\nGreenland has had major glaciers and ice caps for at least 18 million years,[7] but a single ice sheet first covered most of the island some 2.6 million years ago.[8] Since then, it has both grown[9][10] and contracted significantly.[11][12][13] The oldest known ice on Greenland is about 1 million years old.[14] Due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, the ice sheet is now the warmest it has been in the past 1000 years,[15] and is losing ice at the fastest rate in at least the past 12,000 years.[16]\nEvery summer, parts of the surface melt and ice cliffs calve into the sea. Normally the ice sheet would be replenished by winter snowfall,[4] but due to global warming the ice sheet is melting two to five times faster than before 1850,[17] and snowfall has not kept up since 1996.[18] If the Paris Agreement goal of staying below 2 \u00b0C (3.6 \u00b0F) is achieved, melting of Greenland ice alone would still add around 6 cm (2 + 1\u20442 in) to global sea level rise by the end of the century. If there are no reductions in emissions, melting would add around 13 cm (5 in) by 2100,[19]: 1302 with a worst-case of about 33 cm (13 in).[20] For comparison, melting has so far contributed 1.4 cm (1\u20442 in) since 1972,[21] while sea level rise from all sources was 15\u201325 cm (6\u201310 in) between 1901 and 2018.[22]: 5\nIf all 2,900,000 cubic kilometres (696,000 cu mi) of the ice sheet were to melt, it would increase global sea levels by ~7.4 m (24 ft).[2] Global warming between 1.7 \u00b0C (3.1 \u00b0F) and 2.3 \u00b0C (4.1 \u00b0F) would likely make this melting inevitable.[6] However, 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) would still cause ice loss equivalent to 1.4 m (4 + 1\u20442 ft) of sea level rise,[23] and more ice will be lost if the temperatures exceed that level before declining.[6] If global temperatures continue to rise, the ice sheet will likely disappear within 10,000 years.[24][25] At very high warming, its future lifetime goes down to around 1,000 years.[20] Beneath the Greenland ice sheet are mountains and lake basins.\nIce sheets form through a process of glaciation, when the local climate is sufficiently cold that snow is able to accumulate from year to year. As the annual snow layers pile up, their weight gradually compresses the deeper levels of snow to firn and then to solid glacier ice over hundreds of years.[13] Once the ice sheet formed in Greenland, its size remained similar to its current state.[26] However, there have been 11 periods in Greenland's history when the ice sheet extended up to 120 km (75 mi) beyond its current boundaries; with the last one around 1 million years ago.[9][10]\nThe weight of the ice causes it to slowly \"flow\", unless it is stopped by a sufficiently large obstacle, such as a mountain.[13] Greenland has many mountains near its coastline, which normally prevent the ice sheet from flowing further into the Arctic Ocean. The 11 previous episodes of glaciation are notable because the ice sheet grew large enough to flow over those mountains.[9][10] Nowadays, the northwest and southeast margins of the ice sheet are the main areas where there are sufficient gaps in the mountains to enable the ice sheet to flow out to the ocean through outlet glaciers. These glaciers regularly shed ice in what is known as ice calving.[28] Sediment released from calved and melting ice sinks accumulates on the seafloor, and sediment cores from places such as the Fram Strait provide long records of glaciation at Greenland.[7]\nWhile there is evidence of large glaciers in Greenland for most of the past 18 million years,[7] these ice bodies were probably similar to various smaller modern examples, such as Maniitsoq and Flade Isblink, which cover 76,000 and 100,000 square kilometres (29,000 and 39,000 sq mi) around the periphery. Conditions in Greenland were not initially suitable for a single coherent ice sheet to develop, but this began to change around 10 million years ago, during the middle Miocene, when the two passive continental margins which now form the uplands of West and East Greenland experienced uplift, and ultimately formed the upper planation surface at a height of 2000 to 3000 meter above sea level.[29][30]\nLater uplift, during the Pliocene, formed a lower planation surface at 500 to 1000 meters above sea level. A third stage of uplift created multiple valleys and fjords below the planation surfaces. This uplift intensified glaciation due to increased orographic precipitation and cooler surface temperatures, allowing ice to accumulate and persist.[29][30] As recently as 3 million years ago, during the Pliocene warm period, Greenland's ice was limited to the highest peaks in the east and the south.[31] Ice cover gradually expanded since then,[8] until the atmospheric carbon dioxide levels dropped to between 280 and 320 ppm 2.7\u20132.6 million years ago, by which time temperatures had dropped sufficiently for the disparate ice caps to connect and cover most of the island.[3]\nThe base of the ice sheet may be warm enough due to geothermal activity to have liquid water beneath it.[33] This liquid water, under pressure from the weight of ice above it, may cause erosion, eventually leaving nothing but bedrock below the ice sheet.

It is an average of 1.67 km (1.0 mi) thick and over 3 km (1.9 mi) thick at its maximum.[2] It is almost 2,900 kilometres (1,800 mi) long in a north\u2013south direction, with a maximum width of 1,100 kilometres (680 mi) at a latitude of 77\u00b0N, near its northern edge.[1] The ice sheet covers 1,710,000 square kilometres (660,000 sq mi), around 80% of the surface of Greenland, or about 12% of the area of the Antarctic ice sheet.[2] The term 'Greenland ice sheet' is often shortened to GIS or GrIS in scientific literature.[3][4][5][6]\nGreenland has had major glaciers and ice caps for at least 18 million years,[7] but a single ice sheet first covered most of the island some 2.6 million years ago.[8] Since then, it has both grown[9][10] and contracted significantly.[11][12][13] The oldest known ice on Greenland is about 1 million years old.[14] Due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, the ice sheet is now the warmest it has been in the past 1000 years,[15] and is losing ice at the fastest rate in at least the past 12,000 years.[16]\nEvery summer, parts of the surface melt and ice cliffs calve into the sea. Normally the ice sheet would be replenished by winter snowfall,[4] but due to global warming the ice sheet is melting two to five times faster than before 1850,[17] and snowfall has not kept up since 1996.[18] If the Paris Agreement goal of staying below 2 \u00b0C (3.6 \u00b0F) is achieved, melting of Greenland ice alone would still add around 6 cm (2 + 1\u20442 in) to global sea level rise by the end of the century. If there are no reductions in emissions, melting would add around 13 cm (5 in) by 2100,[19]: 1302 with a worst-case of about 33 cm (13 in).[20] For comparison, melting has so far contributed 1.4 cm (1\u20442 in) since 1972,[21] while sea level rise from all sources was 15\u201325 cm (6\u201310 in) between 1901 and 2018.[22]: 5\nIf all 2,900,000 cubic kilometres (696,000 cu mi) of the ice sheet were to melt, it would increase global sea levels by ~7.4 m (24 ft).[2] Global warming between 1.7 \u00b0C (3.1 \u00b0F) and 2.3 \u00b0C (4.1 \u00b0F) would likely make this melting inevitable.[6] However, 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) would still cause ice loss equivalent to 1.4 m (4 + 1\u20442 ft) of sea level rise,[23] and more ice will be lost if the temperatures exceed that level before declining.[6] If global temperatures continue to rise, the ice sheet will likely disappear within 10,000 years.[24][25] At very high warming, its future lifetime goes down to around 1,000 years.[20] Beneath the Greenland ice sheet are mountains and lake basins.\nIce sheets form through a process of glaciation, when the local climate is sufficiently cold that snow is able to accumulate from year to year. As the annual snow layers pile up, their weight gradually compresses the deeper levels of snow to firn and then to solid glacier ice over hundreds of years.[13] Once the ice sheet formed in Greenland, its size remained similar to its current state.[26] However, there have been 11 periods in Greenland's history when the ice sheet extended up to 120 km (75 mi) beyond its current boundaries; with the last one around 1 million years ago.[9][10]\nThe weight of the ice causes it to slowly \"flow\", unless it is stopped by a sufficiently large obstacle, such as a mountain.[13] Greenland has many mountains near its coastline, which normally prevent the ice sheet from flowing further into the Arctic Ocean. The 11 previous episodes of glaciation are notable because the ice sheet grew large enough to flow over those mountains.[9][10] Nowadays, the northwest and southeast margins of the ice sheet are the main areas where there are sufficient gaps in the mountains to enable the ice sheet to flow out to the ocean through outlet glaciers. These glaciers regularly shed ice in what is known as ice calving.[28] Sediment released from calved and melting ice sinks accumulates on the seafloor, and sediment cores from places such as the Fram Strait provide long records of glaciation at Greenland.[7]\nWhile there is evidence of large glaciers in Greenland for most of the past 18 million years,[7] these ice bodies were probably similar to various smaller modern examples, such as Maniitsoq and Flade Isblink, which cover 76,000 and 100,000 square kilometres (29,000 and 39,000 sq mi) around the periphery. Conditions in Greenland were not initially suitable for a single coherent ice sheet to develop, but this began to change around 10 million years ago, during the middle Miocene, when the two passive continental margins which now form the uplands of West and East Greenland experienced uplift, and ultimately formed the upper planation surface at a height of 2000 to 3000 meter above sea level.[29][30]\nLater uplift, during the Pliocene, formed a lower planation surface at 500 to 1000 meters above sea level. A third stage of uplift created multiple valleys and fjords below the planation surfaces. This uplift intensified glaciation due to increased orographic precipitation and cooler surface temperatures, allowing ice to accumulate and persist.[29][30] As recently as 3 million years ago, during the Pliocene warm period, Greenland's ice was limited to the highest peaks in the east and the south.[31] Ice cover gradually expanded since then,[8] until the atmospheric carbon dioxide levels dropped to between 280 and 320 ppm 2.7\u20132.6 million years ago, by which time temperatures had dropped sufficiently for the disparate ice caps to connect and cover most of the island.[3]\nThe base of the ice sheet may be warm enough due to geothermal activity to have liquid water beneath it.[33] This liquid water, under pressure from the weight of ice above it, may cause erosion, eventually leaving nothing but bedrock below the ice sheet.

If there are no reductions in emissions, melting would add around 13 cm (5 in) by 2100,[19]: 1302 with a worst-case of about 33 cm (13 in).[20] For comparison, melting has so far contributed 1.4 cm (1\u20442 in) since 1972,[21] while sea level rise from all sources was 15\u201325 cm (6\u201310 in) between 1901 and 2018.[22]: 5\nIf all 2,900,000 cubic kilometres (696,000 cu mi) of the ice sheet were to melt, it would increase global sea levels by ~7.4 m (24 ft).[2] Global warming between 1.7 \u00b0C (3.1 \u00b0F) and 2.3 \u00b0C (4.1 \u00b0F) would likely make this melting inevitable.[6] However, 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) would still cause ice loss equivalent to 1.4 m (4 + 1\u20442 ft) of sea level rise,[23] and more ice will be lost if the temperatures exceed that level before declining.[6] If global temperatures continue to rise, the ice sheet will likely disappear within 10,000 years.[24][25] At very high warming, its future lifetime goes down to around 1,000 years.[20] Beneath the Greenland ice sheet are mountains and lake basins.\nIce sheets form through a process of glaciation, when the local climate is sufficiently cold that snow is able to accumulate from year to year. As the annual snow layers pile up, their weight gradually compresses the deeper levels of snow to firn and then to solid glacier ice over hundreds of years.[13] Once the ice sheet formed in Greenland, its size remained similar to its current state.[26] However, there have been 11 periods in Greenland's history when the ice sheet extended up to 120 km (75 mi) beyond its current boundaries; with the last one around 1 million years ago.[9][10]\nThe weight of the ice causes it to slowly \"flow\", unless it is stopped by a sufficiently large obstacle, such as a mountain.[13] Greenland has many mountains near its coastline, which normally prevent the ice sheet from flowing further into the Arctic Ocean. The 11 previous episodes of glaciation are notable because the ice sheet grew large enough to flow over those mountains.[9][10] Nowadays, the northwest and southeast margins of the ice sheet are the main areas where there are sufficient gaps in the mountains to enable the ice sheet to flow out to the ocean through outlet glaciers. These glaciers regularly shed ice in what is known as ice calving.[28] Sediment released from calved and melting ice sinks accumulates on the seafloor, and sediment cores from places such as the Fram Strait provide long records of glaciation at Greenland.[7]\nWhile there is evidence of large glaciers in Greenland for most of the past 18 million years,[7] these ice bodies were probably similar to various smaller modern examples, such as Maniitsoq and Flade Isblink, which cover 76,000 and 100,000 square kilometres (29,000 and 39,000 sq mi) around the periphery. Conditions in Greenland were not initially suitable for a single coherent ice sheet to develop, but this began to change around 10 million years ago, during the middle Miocene, when the two passive continental margins which now form the uplands of West and East Greenland experienced uplift, and ultimately formed the upper planation surface at a height of 2000 to 3000 meter above sea level.[29][30]\nLater uplift, during the Pliocene, formed a lower planation surface at 500 to 1000 meters above sea level. A third stage of uplift created multiple valleys and fjords below the planation surfaces. This uplift intensified glaciation due to increased orographic precipitation and cooler surface temperatures, allowing ice to accumulate and persist.[29][30] As recently as 3 million years ago, during the Pliocene warm period, Greenland's ice was limited to the highest peaks in the east and the south.[31] Ice cover gradually expanded since then,[8] until the atmospheric carbon dioxide levels dropped to between 280 and 320 ppm 2.7\u20132.6 million years ago, by which time temperatures had dropped sufficiently for the disparate ice caps to connect and cover most of the island.[3]\nThe base of the ice sheet may be warm enough due to geothermal activity to have liquid water beneath it.[33] This liquid water, under pressure from the weight of ice above it, may cause erosion, eventually leaving nothing but bedrock below the ice sheet. However, there are parts of the Greenland ice sheet, near the summit, where the ice sheet slides over a basal layer of ice which had froze\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

To explore these questions, we apply climate response functions (CRFs) to guide a series of meltwater-perturbation experiments using a fully coupled climate model. In both hemispheres, meltwater drives atmospheric cooling, sea ice expansion, and strengthened Hadley and Ferrel cells. Greenland meltwater induces a slowdown of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) and a cooling of the subsurface ocean in the northern high latitudes. Antarctic meltwater, instead, induces a slowdown of the Antarctic Bottom Water formation and a warming of the subsurface ocean around Antarctica. For melt rates up to 2000 Gt yr\u22121, the climate response is rather linear. However, as melt rates increase to 5000 Gt yr\u22121, the climate response becomes nonlinear. Due to a collapsed AMOC, the climate response is superlinear at high Greenland melt rates. Instead, the climate response is sublinear at high Antarctic melt rates, due to the halting of the northward expansion of Antarctic sea ice by warm surface waters. Finally, in the linear limit, we use CRFs and linear convolution theory to make projections of important climate parameters in response to meltwater scenarios, which suggest that Antarctic meltwater will become a major driver of climate change, dominating that of Greenland meltwater, as the current century proceeds.\nMelting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets is one of the most uncertain potential contributors to future climate change. In this study, we address the comparative role of Greenland and Antarctic meltwater in the climate system and explore the differing mechanisms at work in each hemisphere.

Recent observations have shown that these ice sheets are melting at an accelerating rate (Paolo et al. 2015; Rignot et al. 2019; Mouginot et al. 2019; Shepherd et al. 2018, 2020; King et al. 2020). Between the periods of 1992\u20132011 and 2012\u201317, the rate of ice-mass loss has risen from roughly 100 to 250 Gt yr\u22121 in Greenland (Shepherd et al. 2020) and from 75 Gt yr\u22121 to roughly 200 Gt yr\u22121 in Antarctica (Shepherd et al. 2018). Since the 1990s, their combined contribution to global-mean sea level has been 18 mm, of which 10 mm came from Greenland (Shepherd et al. 2020) and 8 mm from Antarctica (Shepherd et al. 2018). The Greenland ice mass loss is ice-sheet-wide owing to rapidly increasing surface melting and ice dynamical imbalances (King et al. 2020). The Antarctic ice sheet retreat is largely due to ice-shelf basal melt and iceberg calving in roughly equal magnitude along the periphery, primarily in the Amundsen\u2013Bellingshausen Sea sectors (West Antarctica), Wilkes Land (East Antarctica), and the West and Northeast Peninsula (Rignot et al. 2019). Twenty-first-century simulations of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets forced with time-evolving ocean and climate fields derived from a high-emissions scenario suggest that the projected melt rates would exceed 500 and 5000 Gt yr\u22121, respectively, by 2100, leading to a total sea level rise in excess of 250 mm with meltwater feedback (Golledge et al. 2019).\nMeltwater from Greenland and Antarctica contributes not only to sea level but also initiates climate change through its effect, for example, on sea ice extent and the ocean\u2019s overturning circulation. One might expect the impacts of Greenland meltwater to be different from that of Antarctic meltwater because they act in different hemispheres and perturb different parts of the climate system. For example, it is thought that Antarctic meltwater spreading to the proximal ocean initiates surface cooling and freshening trends across the Southern Ocean (Bronselaer et al. 2018; Rye et al. 2020). Enhanced basal melt of Antarctic ice shelves (Rignot et al. 2013; Depoorter et al. 2013; Adusumilli et al. 2020) can cause significant sea ice expansion by suppressing convective mixing and its associated vertical heat exchange (Hellmer 2004; Bintanja et al. 2013). Meltwater discharge along the Antarctic continental shelf tends to weaken the Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) formation and abyssal ocean overturning (Silvano et al. 2018; Lago and England 2019; Li et al. 2023). Meltwater discharge from Greenland, meanwhile, can reduce deep ocean ventilation via a slowdown in the formation rate of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) originating in the Nordic seas [Greenland\u2013Iceland\u2013Norwegian (GIN) Seas] (B\u00f6ning et al. 2016), and a slowdown of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC; Rahmstorf et al. 2015; Bakker et al. 2016).

To explore these questions, we apply climate response functions (CRFs) to guide a series of meltwater-perturbation experiments using a fully coupled climate model. In both hemispheres, meltwater drives atmospheric cooling, sea ice expansion, and strengthened Hadley and Ferrel cells. Greenland meltwater induces a slowdown of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) and a cooling of the subsurface ocean in the northern high latitudes. Antarctic meltwater, instead, induces a slowdown of the Antarctic Bottom Water formation and a warming of the subsurface ocean around Antarctica. For melt rates up to 2000 Gt yr\u22121, the climate response is rather linear. However, as melt rates increase to 5000 Gt yr\u22121, the climate response becomes nonlinear. Due to a collapsed AMOC, the climate response is superlinear at high Greenland melt rates. Instead, the climate response is sublinear at high Antarctic melt rates, due to the halting of the northward expansion of Antarctic sea ice by warm surface waters. Finally, in the linear limit, we use CRFs and linear convolution theory to make projections of important climate parameters in response to meltwater scenarios, which suggest that Antarctic meltwater will become a major driver of climate change, dominating that of Greenland meltwater, as the current century proceeds.\nMelting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets is one of the most uncertain potential contributors to future climate change. In this study, we address the comparative role of Greenland and Antarctic meltwater in the climate system and explore the differing mechanisms at work in each hemisphere. We find that the climate response is linear for low melt rates but becomes nonlinear for high melt rates. As the century proceeds, we speculate that Antarctic meltwater will increasingly dominate that of Greenland meltwater, leading to atmospheric cooling, Antarctic sea ice expansion, and contraction and warming of the Antarctic Bottom Water. Greenland meltwater will, instead, affect smaller changes in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\u00a9 2023 American Meteorological Society.

Recent observations have shown that these ice sheets are melting at an accelerating rate (Paolo et al. 2015; Rignot et al. 2019; Mouginot et al. 2019; Shepherd et al. 2018, 2020; King et al. 2020). Between the periods of 1992\u20132011 and 2012\u201317, the rate of ice-mass loss has risen from roughly 100 to 250 Gt yr\u22121 in Greenland (Shepherd et al. 2020) and from 75 Gt yr\u22121 to roughly 200 Gt yr\u22121 in Antarctica (Shepherd et al. 2018). Since the 1990s, their combined contribution to global-mean sea level has been 18 mm, of which 10 mm came from Greenland (Shepherd et al. 2020) and 8 mm from Antarctica (Shepherd et al. 2018). The Greenland ice mass loss is ice-sheet-wide owing to rapidly increasing surface melting and ice dynamical imbalances (King et al. 2020). The Antarctic ice sheet retreat is largely due to ice-shelf basal melt and iceberg calving in roughly equal magnitude along the periphery, primarily in the Amundsen\u2013Bellingshausen Sea sectors (West Antarctica), Wilkes Land (East Antarctica), and the West and Northeast Peninsula (Rignot et al. 2019). Twenty-first-century simulations of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets forced with time-evolving ocean and climate fields derived from a high-emissions scenario suggest that the projected melt rates would exceed 500 and 5000 Gt yr\u22121, respectively, by 2100, leading to a total sea level rise in excess of 250 mm with meltwater feedback (Golledge et al. 2019).\nMeltwater from Greenland and Antarctica contributes not only to sea level but also initiates climate change through its effect, for example, on sea ice extent and the ocean\u2019s overturning circulation. One might expect the impacts of Greenland meltwater to be different from that of Antarctic meltwater because they act in different hemispheres and perturb different parts of the climate system. For example, it is thought that Antarctic meltwater spreading to the proximal ocean initiates surface cooling and freshening trends across the Southern Ocean (Bronselaer et al. 2018; Rye et al. 2020). Enhanced basal melt of Antarctic ice shelves (Rignot et al. 2013; Depoorter et al. 2013; Adusumilli et al. 2020) can cause significant sea ice expansion by suppressing convective mixing and its associated vertical heat exchange (Hellmer 2004; Bintanja et al. 2013). Meltwater discharge along the Antarctic continental shelf tends to weaken the Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) formation and abyssal ocean overturning (Silvano et al. 2018; Lago and England 2019; Li et al. 2023). Meltwater discharge from Greenland, meanwhile, can reduce deep ocean ventilation via a slowdown in the formation rate of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) originating in the Nordic seas [Greenland\u2013Iceland\u2013Norwegian (GIN) Seas] (B\u00f6ning et al. 2016), and a slowdown of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC; Rahmstorf et al. 2015; Bakker et al. 2016). Antarctic meltwater can also affect the AMOC, but the sense of the change remains controversial. Stouffer et al. (2007) found that the AMOC remains unchanged or slightly weakened due to Antarctic meltwater spreading across the sea surface i\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",
