    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nI\u2019m an atmospheric physicist. I\u2019ve published more than 200 scientific papers. For 30 years I taught at MIT, during which time the climate has changed remarkably little. But the cry of \u201cglobal warming\u201d has grown ever more shrill. In fact, it seems that the less the climate changes, the louder the voices of the climate alarmists get. So, let\u2019s clear the air and create a more accurate picture of where we really stand on the issue of global warming or, as it is now called -- climate change. There are basically three groups of people dealing with this issue. Groups one and two are scientists. Group three consists mostly, at its core, of politicians, environmentalists and media. Group one is associated with the scientific part of the United Nation\u2019s International Panel on Climate Change or IPCC (Working Group 1). These are scientists who mostly believe that recent climate change is primarily due to man\u2019s burning of fossil fuels -- oil, coal and natural gas. This releases C02, carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere and, they believe, this might eventually dangerously heat the planet. Group two is made up of scientists who don\u2019t see this as an especially serious problem. This is the group I belong to. We\u2019re usually referred to as skeptics. We note that there are many reasons why the climate changes -- the sun, clouds, oceans, the orbital variations of the earth, as well as a myriad of other inputs. None of these is fully understood, and there is no evidence that CO2 emissions are the dominant factor. But actually there is much agreement between both groups of scientists. The following are such points of agreement: 1) The climate is always changing. 2) CO2 is a greenhouse gas without which life on earth is not possible, but adding it to the atmosphere should lead to some warming. 3) Atmospheric levels of CO2 have been increasing since the end of the Little Ice Age in the 19th century. 4) Over this period (the past two centuries), the global mean temperature has increased slightly and erratically by about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit or one degree Celsius; but only since the 1960\u2019s have man\u2019s greenhouse emissions been sufficient to play a role. 5) Given the complexity of climate, no confident prediction about future global mean temperature or its impact can be made. The IPCC, acknowledged in its own 2007 report that \u201cThe long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible.\u201d Most importantly, the scenario that the burning of fossil fuels leads to catastrophe isn\u2019t part of what either group asserts. So why are so many people worried, indeed, panic stricken about this issue. Here\u2019s where Group Three comes in -- the politicians, environmentalists, and media. Global Warming Alarmism provides them, more than any other issue, with the things they most want: For politicians it\u2019s money and power. For environmentalists it\u2019s money for their organizations and confirmation of their near religious devotion to the idea that man is a destructive force acting upon nature. And for the media it\u2019s ideology, money, and headlines -- doomsday scenarios sell. Meanwhile, over the last decade, scientists outside of climate physics have jumped on the bandwagon, publishing papers blaming global warming for everything from acne to the Syrian civil war. And, crony capitalists have eagerly grabbed for the subsidies that governments have so lavishly provided. Unfortunately, group three is winning the argument because they have drowned out the serious debate that should be going on. But while politicians, environmentalists and media types can waste a lot of money and scare a lot of people, they won\u2019t be able to bury the truth. The climate will have the final word on that.

It is not an attack on the veracity of climate models, which project broad climate trends over time, he said.\nUSA TODAY reached out to the social media users who shared the claim for comment.\nThe social media post fundamentally misinterprets the 2001 IPCC statement, Zeke Hausfather, a research scientist at Berkeley Earth and IPCC author, told USA TODAY.\nThe statement correctly indicates that climate models cannot predict exact \"climate states,\" such as a particular weather event, on a given day in the distant future, he said in an email.\nFact check: Warming varies across oceans and atmosphere, doesn't contradict climate change\nBut they can successfully predict important broader trends.\n\"We can never predict if it will rain on March 2, 2055, in San Francisco, or even know for sure that 2055 will be warmer or cooler than 2054 given internal variability in the climate due \u2013 primarily \u2013 to El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events,\" Hausfather said. \"However, we can be absolutely sure that \u2013 barring a massive volcanic eruption \u2013 2055 will be much warmer than 2022.\"\nOne of the ways that climate scientists confirm the validity of climate models is by examining models that were created in the past to see if they accurately predicted subsequent global temperatures, Fox-Kemper said.\nFor instance, NOAA, NASA, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Berkeley Earth researchers recently analyzed the projections made by climate models published between 1970 and 2007.\nThe researchers compared the temperature projections from each model to the actual observed temperatures that occurred after the model results were published.\nThey found that most of the models made warming predictions consistent with subsequent temperature rise. For some of the models, the authors either overestimated or underestimated model inputs, such as the amount of CO2 humans would produce in the future.\nFor these models, the results matched actual observed warming when the models were re-run with the corrected inputs \u2013 actual CO2 emissions, for instance.\n\"We find that climate models published over the past five decades were generally quite accurate in predicting global warming in the years after publication, particularly when accounting for differences between modeled and actual changes in atmospheric CO2 and other climate drivers,\" the study authors wrote.\nWhile many of these older climate models reliably predicted warming, more recent models are advantaged by the powerful computing technology that has come online in recent years, Elizabeth Maroon, a climate scientist and assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, told USA TODAY.\nFact check: Short term global temperature fluctuations do not negate climate science, overall warming\n\"Because we have more computational power, you can have higher resolution. You can have more details in your climate model,\" Maroon said. \"If anything, we've become more certain, not less, in more recent times, with what the range of our projections are.\"\nBased on our research, we rate MISSING CONTEXT the claim that the IPCC said \"long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible,\" because without additional information the claim is misleading. The IPCC statement accurately asserts that \"climate states\" such as weather events or the occurrence of an El Ni\u00f1o cannot be predicted very far in advance.

Superficially, it is frequently portrayed as a `simple' issue. Gases which absorb infrared radiation (known as greenhouse gases) inhibit radiative cooling of the earths surface and hence increasing greenhouse gases must lead to warming. The issue is rendered more complex by the fact that the surface of the earth does not cool primarily by means of radiation, but rather cools by evaporation and convection. Moreover, the main greenhouse gas is water vapor which is both natural in origin and highly variable in its distribution. In the absence of good records of water vapor we aren't even in a position to say how much total greenhouse gases have increased. If this weren't bad enough, it isn't even the total amount of greenhouse gas which matters; for example, a molecule of water vapor at 12 km altitude is more effective than a thousand molecules near the surface. All of this might not be relevant if models were trustworthy, but satellite measurements of upper level water vapor show profound discrepancies in model results. Under the circumstances, it is surprising that there is any agreement among scientists, but, in fact, most scientists working on climate dynamics would agree that increasing levels of carbon dioxide should have some impact on climate. The real argument is over whether the impact will be significant. The word `significant,' in this context, has a rather specific meaning. The climate is a naturally variable system. That is to say, it varies without any external forcing. Human society already has to deal with this degree of variability over which it has no control. For anthropogenic climate change to be `significant,' it must be as large or larger than natural variability. For smaller changes, the historical record demonstrates our capacity to adapt. It is in this context that the statement frequently drawn from the 1995 IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report assumes some relevance. It is important, therefore, to know precisely what this statement does and doesn't say. Although it is likely that the statement is also incorrect, that turns out to be less important.\nDiscernable influence\nLet us begin by quoting this statement (which, in contrast to earlier IPCC reports, gives considerable more attention to important caveats):\n\"Our ability to quantify the human influence on global climate is currently limited because the expected signal is still emerging from the noise of natural variability, and because there are uncertainties in key factors. These include the magnitude and patterns of long-term natural variability and the time-evolving pattern of forcing by, and response to, changes in concentrations of greenhouse and aerosols, and land-surface changes. Nevertheless, the balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on global climate.\"\nWhat it says is that the climate's behavior over the past century appears \"unlikely to be due entirely to natural variability (IPCC 1995, p. 412).\" As Chapter 8 of IPCC 95 points out, even this trivial assertion, which, as I have noted, seems totally compatible with our theoretical understanding and makes no claims concerning the magnitude of global warming, is dependent on the assumption that natural variability is replicated in models (IPCC 95 p. 430) an assumption which is clearly untrue since major observed components of natural variability like the quasi-biennial oscillation and El-Ni\ufffdo are either not replicated at all or replicated very poorly. Indeed the very structure of the circulation in models is different from what is observed in the data (Polyak and North, 1997). The specific feature which led Santer (the lead author of Chapter 8 of IPCC 95) to claim discovery of the discernible impact of anthropogenic forcing fails the most elementary test of statistical robustness: namely, it disappears when additional data is considered. Chapter 8 concludes that our ability to quantify the magnitude of global warming \"is currently limited by uncertainties in key factors, including the magnitude and patterns of longer-term natural variability and the time-evolving patterns of forcing by (and response to) greenhouse gases and aerosols.\" In brief, a decade of focus on global warming and billions of dollars of research funds have still failed to establish that global warming is a significant problem. Normally, this would lead one to conclude that the problem is less serious than originally suggested. While the IPCC 1995 report does not go so far as to state this explicitly, it is certainly the most subdued and reserved of the numerous IPCC reports issued since 1990.\nIt has been a remarkable example of semantic distortion that this weak and unsupportable statement has encouraged environmental advocates to claim that this report endorses various catastrophic scenarios. An appeal issued a few days ago by one such organization, The Union of Concerned Scientists, illustrates the general procedure. The statement begins with a clear misrepresentation of the IPCC statement: \"Predictions of global climatic change are becoming more confident. A broad consensus among the world's climatologists is that there is now `a discernible human influence on global climate.'\" The UCS immediately continues: \"Climate change is projected to raise sea levels, threatening populations and ecosystems in coastal regions. Warmer temperatures will lead to a more vigorous hydrological cycle, increasing the prospects for more intense rainfall, floods, and droughts in some regions. Human health may be damaged by greater exposure to heat waves and droughts, and by encroachment of tropical diseases to higher latitudes.\" The UCS proceeds to then associate climate change with forest depletion, water scarcity, food security, and species destruction.

Superficially, it is frequently portrayed as a `simple' issue. Gases which absorb infrared radiation (known as greenhouse gases) inhibit radiative cooling of the earths surface and hence increasing greenhouse gases must lead to warming. The issue is rendered more complex by the fact that the surface of the earth does not cool primarily by means of radiation, but rather cools by evaporation and convection. Moreover, the main greenhouse gas is water vapor which is both natural in origin and highly variable in its distribution. In the absence of good records of water vapor we aren't even in a position to say how much total greenhouse gases have increased. If this weren't bad enough, it isn't even the total amount of greenhouse gas which matters; for example, a molecule of water vapor at 12 km altitude is more effective than a thousand molecules near the surface. All of this might not be relevant if models were trustworthy, but satellite measurements of upper level water vapor show profound discrepancies in model results. Under the circumstances, it is surprising that there is any agreement among scientists, but, in fact, most scientists working on climate dynamics would agree that increasing levels of carbon dioxide should have some impact on climate. The real argument is over whether the impact will be significant. The word `significant,' in this context, has a rather specific meaning. The climate is a naturally variable system. That is to say, it varies without any external forcing. Human society already has to deal with this degree of variability over which it has no control. For anthropogenic climate change to be `significant,' it must be as large or larger than natural variability. For smaller changes, the historical record demonstrates our capacity to adapt. It is in this context that the statement frequently drawn from the 1995 IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report assumes some relevance. It is important, therefore, to know precisely what this statement does and doesn't say. Although it is likely that the statement is also incorrect, that turns out to be less important.\nDiscernable influence\nLet us begin by quoting this statement (which, in contrast to earlier IPCC reports, gives considerable more attention to important caveats):\n\"Our ability to quantify the human influence on global climate is currently limited because the expected signal is still emerging from the noise of natural variability, and because there are uncertainties in key factors. These include the magnitude and patterns of long-term natural variability and the time-evolving pattern of forcing by, and response to, changes in concentrations of greenhouse and aerosols, and land-surface changes. Nevertheless, the balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on global climate.\"\nWhat it says is that the climate's behavior over the past century appears \"unlikely to be due entirely to natural variability (IPCC 1995, p. 412).\" As Chapter 8 of IPCC 95 points out, even this trivial assertion, which, as I have noted, seems totally compatible with our theoretical understanding and makes no claims concerning the magnitude of global warming, is dependent on the assumption that natural variability is replicated in models (IPCC 95 p. 430) an assumption which is clearly untrue since major observed components of natural variability like the quasi-biennial oscillation and El-Ni\ufffdo are either not replicated at all or replicated very poorly. Indeed the very structure of the circulation in models is different from what is observed in the data (Polyak and North, 1997). The specific feature which led Santer (the lead author of Chapter 8 of IPCC 95) to claim discovery of the discernible impact of anthropogenic forcing fails the most elementary test of statistical robustness: namely, it disappears when additional data is considered. Chapter 8 concludes that our ability to quantify the magnitude of global warming \"is currently limited by uncertainties in key factors, including the magnitude and patterns of longer-term natural variability and the time-evolving patterns of forcing by (and response to) greenhouse gases and aerosols.\" In brief, a decade of focus on global warming and billions of dollars of research funds have still failed to establish that global warming is a significant problem. Normally, this would lead one to conclude that the problem is less serious than originally suggested. While the IPCC 1995 report does not go so far as to state this explicitly, it is certainly the most subdued and reserved of the numerous IPCC reports issued since 1990.\nIt has been a remarkable example of semantic distortion that this weak and unsupportable statement has encouraged environmental advocates to claim that this report endorses various catastrophic scenarios. An appeal issued a few days ago by one such organization, The Union of Concerned Scientists, illustrates the general procedure. The statement begins with a clear misrepresentation of the IPCC statement: \"Predictions of global climatic change are becoming more confident. A broad consensus among the world's climatologists is that there is now `a discernible human influence on global climate.'\" The UCS immediately continues: \"Climate change is projected to raise sea levels, threatening populations and ecosystems in coastal regions.

While natural variability plays some part, the preponderance of evidence indicates that human activities\u2014particularly emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases\u2014are mostly responsible for making our planet warmer.\nAccording to an ongoing temperature analysis led by scientists at NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), the average global temperature on Earth has increased by at least 1.1\u00b0 Celsius (1.9\u00b0 Fahrenheit) since 1880. The majority of the warming has occurred since 1975, at a rate of roughly 0.15 to 0.20\u00b0C per decade.\nThe maps above show temperature anomalies in five-year increments since 1880. (Click on the arrow to run the animation.) These are not absolute temperatures, but changes from the norm for each area. The data reflect how much warmer or cooler each region was compared to a base period of 1951-1980. (The global mean surface air temperature for that period was 14\u00b0C (57\u00b0F), with an uncertainty of several tenths of a degree.)\nThe image below shows global temperature anomalies in 2022, which tied for the fifth warmest year on record. The past nine years have been the warmest years since modern recordkeeping began in 1880.\nAs the maps show, global warming does not mean temperatures rise everywhere at every time by same rate. Temperatures might rise 5 degrees in one region and drop 2 degrees in another. For instance, exceptionally cold winters in one place might be balanced by extremely warm winters in another part of the world. Generally, warming is greater over land than over the oceans because water is slower to absorb and release heat (thermal inertia). Warming may also differ substantially within specific land masses and ocean basins.\nIn the animation at the top of the page and in the bar chart below, the years from 1880 to 1939 tend to be cooler, then level off by the 1950s. Decades within the base period (1951-1980) do not appear particularly warm or cold because they are the standard against which other years are measured.\nThe leveling off of temperatures in the middle of the 20th century can be explained by natural variability and by the cooling effects of aerosols generated by factories, power plants, and motor vehicles in the years of rapid economic growth after World War II. Fossil fuel use also increased after the war (5 percent per year), boosting greenhouse gases. Cooling from aerosol pollution happened rapidly. In contrast, greenhouse gases accumulated slowly, but they remain in the atmosphere for a much longer time. According to former GISS director James Hansen, the strong warming trend of the past four decades likely reflects a shift from balanced aerosol and greenhouse gas effects on the atmosphere to a predominance of greenhouse gas effects after aerosols were curbed by pollution controls.\nWhy should we care about one or two degrees of global warming? After all, temperatures fluctuate by many degrees every day where we live.\nThe temperatures we experience locally and in short periods can fluctuate significantly due to predictable, cyclical events (night and day, summer and winter) and hard-to-predict wind and precipitation patterns. But the global temperature mainly depends on how much energy the planet receives from the Sun and how much it radiates back into space. The energy coming from the Sun fluctuates very little by year, while the amount of energy radiated by Earth is closely tied to the chemical composition of the atmosphere\u2014particularly the amount of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.\nA one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all of the oceans, the atmosphere, and the land masses by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age. A five-degree drop was enough to bury a large part of North America under a towering mass of ice 20,000 years ago.\nGlobal temperature records start around 1880 because observations did not sufficiently cover enough of the planet prior to that time. The line plot above shows yearly temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2020 as recorded by NASA, NOAA, the Berkeley Earth research group, the Met Office Hadley Centre (United Kingdom), and the Cowtan and Way analysis. Though there are minor variations from year to year, all five records show peaks and valleys in sync with each other. All show rapid warming in the past few decades, and all show the last decade as the warmest.\nThe NASA GISS team chose the period of 1951-1980 as its baseline largely because the U.S. National Weather Service uses a three-decade period to define \u201cnormal\u201d or average temperature. The GISS temperature analysis effort also began around 1980, so the most recent 30 years was 1951-1980. Their objective is to provide an estimate of temperature change that could be compared with predictions of global climate change in response to atmospheric carbon dioxide, aerosols, and changes in solar activity.\nNASA\u2019s temperature analyses incorporate surface temperature measurements from more than 20,000 weather stations, ship- and buoy-based observations of sea surface temperatures, and temperature measurements from Antarctic research stations.

While natural variability plays some part, the preponderance of evidence indicates that human activities\u2014particularly emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases\u2014are mostly responsible for making our planet warmer.\nAccording to an ongoing temperature analysis led by scientists at NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), the average global temperature on Earth has increased by at least 1.1\u00b0 Celsius (1.9\u00b0 Fahrenheit) since 1880. The majority of the warming has occurred since 1975, at a rate of roughly 0.15 to 0.20\u00b0C per decade.\nThe maps above show temperature anomalies in five-year increments since 1880. (Click on the arrow to run the animation.) These are not absolute temperatures, but changes from the norm for each area. The data reflect how much warmer or cooler each region was compared to a base period of 1951-1980. (The global mean surface air temperature for that period was 14\u00b0C (57\u00b0F), with an uncertainty of several tenths of a degree.)\nThe image below shows global temperature anomalies in 2022, which tied for the fifth warmest year on record. The past nine years have been the warmest years since modern recordkeeping began in 1880.\nAs the maps show, global warming does not mean temperatures rise everywhere at every time by same rate. Temperatures might rise 5 degrees in one region and drop 2 degrees in another. For instance, exceptionally cold winters in one place might be balanced by extremely warm winters in another part of the world. Generally, warming is greater over land than over the oceans because water is slower to absorb and release heat (thermal inertia). Warming may also differ substantially within specific land masses and ocean basins.\nIn the animation at the top of the page and in the bar chart below, the years from 1880 to 1939 tend to be cooler, then level off by the 1950s. Decades within the base period (1951-1980) do not appear particularly warm or cold because they are the standard against which other years are measured.\nThe leveling off of temperatures in the middle of the 20th century can be explained by natural variability and by the cooling effects of aerosols generated by factories, power plants, and motor vehicles in the years of rapid economic growth after World War II. Fossil fuel use also increased after the war (5 percent per year), boosting greenhouse gases. Cooling from aerosol pollution happened rapidly. In contrast, greenhouse gases accumulated slowly, but they remain in the atmosphere for a much longer time. According to former GISS director James Hansen, the strong warming trend of the past four decades likely reflects a shift from balanced aerosol and greenhouse gas effects on the atmosphere to a predominance of greenhouse gas effects after aerosols were curbed by pollution controls.\nWhy should we care about one or two degrees of global warming? After all, temperatures fluctuate by many degrees every day where we live.\nThe temperatures we experience locally and in short periods can fluctuate significantly due to predictable, cyclical events (night and day, summer and winter) and hard-to-predict wind and precipitation patterns. But the global temperature mainly depends on how much energy the planet receives from the Sun and how much it radiates back into space. The energy coming from the Sun fluctuates very little by year, while the amount of energy radiated by Earth is closely tied to the chemical composition of the atmosphere\u2014particularly the amount of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.\nA one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all of the oceans, the atmosphere, and the land masses by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age. A five-degree drop was enough to bury a large part of North America under a towering mass of ice 20,000 years ago.\nGlobal temperature records start around 1880 because observations did not sufficiently cover enough of the planet prior to that time. The line plot above shows yearly temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2020 as recorded by NASA, NOAA, the Berkeley Earth research group, the Met Office Hadley Centre (United Kingdom), and the Cowtan and Way analysis. Though there are minor variations from year to year, all five records show peaks and valleys in sync with each other. All show rapid warming in the past few decades, and all show the last decade as the warmest.\nThe NASA GISS team chose the period of 1951-1980 as its baseline largely because the U.S. National Weather Service uses a three-decade period to define \u201cnormal\u201d or average temperature.

Richard S. Lindzen. Born, (1940 ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nRichard Siegmund Lindzen (born February 8, 1940) is an American atmospheric physicist known for his work in the dynamics of the middle atmosphere, atmospheric tides, and ozone photochemistry. He is the author of more than 200 scientific papers. From 1972 to 1982, he served as the Gordon McKay Professor of Dynamic Meteorology at Harvard University. In 1983, he was appointed as the Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he would remain until his retirement in 2013.[2][1] Lindzen has disputed the scientific consensus on climate change and criticizes what he has called \"climate alarmism\".[3][4]\nLindzen was born on February 8, 1940, in Webster, Massachusetts.[1] His father, a shoemaker, had fled Nazi Germany with his mother. Lindzen moved to The Bronx soon after his birth and grew up in a Jewish household in a predominantly Catholic neighborhood.[4][5]\nLindzen attended the Bronx High School of Science, where he won Regents' and National Merit Scholarships, then Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute before matriculating at Harvard University.[6] In 1960, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in physics, magna cum laude, followed by a Master of Science degree in applied mathematics in 1961 and a Ph.D. in applied mathematics in 1964. His doctoral thesis, Radiative and photochemical processes in strato- and mesospheric dynamics, was about the interactions of ozone photochemistry, radiative transfer, and dynamics in the middle atmosphere.[7]\nLindzen has published papers on Hadley circulation, monsoon meteorology, planetary atmospheres, hydrodynamic instability, mid-latitude weather, global heat transport, the water cycle, ice ages and seasonal atmospheric effects. His main contribution to the academic literature on anthropogenic climate change is his proposal of the iris hypothesis in 2001, with co-authors Ming-Dah Chou and Arthur Y. Hou.[8][9]\nLindzen is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the Science, Health, and Economic Advisory Council at the Annapolis Center for Science-Based Public Policy. He joined MIT in 1983, prior to which he held positions at the University of Washington (1964\u201365), the Institute for Theoretical Meteorology at the University of Copenhagen, the University of Oslo (1965\u201367), the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) (1966\u201367), and the University of Chicago (1968\u201372). From 1972 to 1982, he served as the Gordon McKay Professor of Dynamic Meteorology at Harvard University. Lindzen also briefly held a position of visiting lecturer at UCLA in 1967.[10]\nAs of January 2010, his publications list included 230 papers and articles published between 1965 and 2008, with five in process for 2009. He is the author of a standard textbook on atmospheric dynamics, and co-authored the monograph Atmospheric Tides with Sydney Chapman.[11]\nHe was Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Meteorology at MIT from 1983,[1] until his retirement which was reported in the Spring 2013 newsletter of MIT's Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS).[2] On December 27, 2013, the Cato Institute announced his appointment as a Distinguished Senior Fellow in its Center for the Study of Science.[12]\nLindzen's early work was concerned with ozone photochemistry, the aerodynamics of the middle atmosphere, the theory of atmospheric tides, and planetary waves. His work in these areas led him to a number of fundamental scientific discoveries, including the discovery of negative equivalent depths in classical tidal theory, explanations for both the quasi-biennial oscillation of the Earth's stratosphere and the four-day period of the superrotation of the Venus atmosphere above the cloud top.\nHis PhD thesis of 1964 concerned the interactions of ozone photochemistry, radiative transfer and the dynamics of the middle atmosphere. This formed the basis of his seminal Radiative and Photochemical Processes in Mesospheric Dynamics that was published in four parts in the Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences between 1965 and 1966.[13][14][15][16][17] The first of these, Part I: Models for Radiative and Photochemical Processes, was co-authored with his Harvard colleague and former PhD thesis advisor, Richard M. Goody, who is well known for his 1964 textbook Atmospheric Radiation.[18] The Lindzen and Goody (1965) study has been widely cited as foundational in the exact modeling of middle atmosphere ozone photochemistry. This work was extended in 1973 to include the effects of nitrogen and hydrogen reactions with his former PhD student, Donna Blake, in Effect of photochemical models on calculated equilibria and cooling rates in the stratosphere.[19]\nLindzen's work on ozone photochemistry has been important in studies that look at the effects that anthropogenic ozone depletion will have on climate.[20]\nSince the time of Pierre-Simon Laplace (1799),[21] scientists had been puzzled as to why pressure variations measured at the Earth's surface associated with the semi-diurnal solar tide dominate those of the diurnal tide in amplitude, when intuitively one would expect the diurnal passage of the sun to dominate. Lord Kelvin (1882) had proposed the so-called \"resonance\" theory, wherein the semi-diurnal tide would be \"selected\" over the diurnal oscillation if the atmosphere was somehow able to oscillate freely at a period of very close to 12 hours, in the same way that overtones are selected on a vibrating string. By the second half of the twentieth century, however, observations had failed to confirm this hypothesis, and an alternative hypothesis was proposed that something must instead suppress the diurnal tide. In 1961, Manfred Siebert suggested that absorption of solar insolation by tropospheric water vapour might account for the reduction of the diurnal tide.[22] However, he failed to include a role for stratospheric ozone. This was rectified in 1963 by the Australian physicist Stuart Thomas Butler and his student K.A. Small who showed that stratospheric\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Warming may also differ substantially within specific land masses and ocean basins.\nIn the animation at the top of the page and in the bar chart below, the years from 1880 to 1939 tend to be cooler, then level off by the 1950s. Decades within the base period (1951-1980) do not appear particularly warm or cold because they are the standard against which other years are measured.\nThe leveling off of temperatures in the middle of the 20th century can be explained by natural variability and by the cooling effects of aerosols generated by factories, power plants, and motor vehicles in the years of rapid economic growth after World War II. Fossil fuel use also increased after the war (5 percent per year), boosting greenhouse gases. Cooling from aerosol pollution happened rapidly. In contrast, greenhouse gases accumulated slowly, but they remain in the atmosphere for a much longer time. According to former GISS director James Hansen, the strong warming trend of the past four decades likely reflects a shift from balanced aerosol and greenhouse gas effects on the atmosphere to a predominance of greenhouse gas effects after aerosols were curbed by pollution controls.\nWhy should we care about one or two degrees of global warming? After all, temperatures fluctuate by many degrees every day where we live.\nThe temperatures we experience locally and in short periods can fluctuate significantly due to predictable, cyclical events (night and day, summer and winter) and hard-to-predict wind and precipitation patterns. But the global temperature mainly depends on how much energy the planet receives from the Sun and how much it radiates back into space. The energy coming from the Sun fluctuates very little by year, while the amount of energy radiated by Earth is closely tied to the chemical composition of the atmosphere\u2014particularly the amount of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.\nA one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all of the oceans, the atmosphere, and the land masses by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age. A five-degree drop was enough to bury a large part of North America under a towering mass of ice 20,000 years ago.\nGlobal temperature records start around 1880 because observations did not sufficiently cover enough of the planet prior to that time. The line plot above shows yearly temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2020 as recorded by NASA, NOAA, the Berkeley Earth research group, the Met Office Hadley Centre (United Kingdom), and the Cowtan and Way analysis. Though there are minor variations from year to year, all five records show peaks and valleys in sync with each other. All show rapid warming in the past few decades, and all show the last decade as the warmest.\nThe NASA GISS team chose the period of 1951-1980 as its baseline largely because the U.S. National Weather Service uses a three-decade period to define \u201cnormal\u201d or average temperature. The GISS temperature analysis effort also began around 1980, so the most recent 30 years was 1951-1980. Their objective is to provide an estimate of temperature change that could be compared with predictions of global climate change in response to atmospheric carbon dioxide, aerosols, and changes in solar activity.\nNASA\u2019s temperature analyses incorporate surface temperature measurements from more than 20,000 weather stations, ship- and buoy-based observations of sea surface temperatures, and temperature measurements from Antarctic research stations. These in situ measurements are analyzed using an algorithm that considers the varied spacing of temperature stations around the globe and urban heat island effects.\nSubscribe to the Earth Observatory and get the Earth in your inbox.\nNASA's Earth Observatory brings you the Earth, every day, with in-depth stories and stunning imagery.\nExplore Earth Science\nEarth Science Data\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

While this claim may well be correct, there are no detailed temperature records extending back 100,000 years, so we don\u2019t know for sure.\nHere\u2019s what we can confidently say about when Earth was last this hot.\nScientists concluded a few years ago that Earth had entered a new climate state not seen in more than 100,000 years. As fellow climate scientist Nick McKay and I recently discussed in a scientific journal article, that conclusion was part of a climate assessment report published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2021.\nEarth was already more than 1 degree Celsius (1.8 Fahrenheit) warmer than preindustrial times, and the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere were high enough to assure temperatures would stay elevated for a long time.\nEarth\u2019s average temperature has exceeded 1 degree Celsius (1.8 F) above the preindustrial baseline. This new climate state will very likely persist for centuries as the warmest period in more than 100,000 years. The chart shows different reconstructions of temperature over time, with measured temperatures since 1850 and a projection to 2300 based on an intermediate emissions scenario. Chart by D.S. Kaufman and N.P. McKay, 2022, and published datasets/Author provided\nEven under the most optimistic scenarios of the future \u2013 in which humans stop burning fossil fuels and reduce other greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 average global temperature will very likely remain at least 1 C above preindustrial temperatures, and possibly much higher, for multiple centuries.\nThis new climate state, characterized by a multi-century global warming level of 1 C and higher, can be reliably compared with temperature reconstructions from the very distant past.\nTo reconstruct temperatures from times before thermometers, paleoclimate scientists rely on information stored in a variety of natural archives.\nThe most widespread archive going back many thousands of years is at the bottom of lakes and oceans, where an assortment of biological, chemical and physical evidence offers clues to the past. These materials build up continuously over time and can be analyzed by extracting a sediment core from the lake bed or ocean floor.\nThese sediment-based records are rich sources of information that have enabled paleoclimate scientists to reconstruct past global temperatures, but they have important limitations.\nFor one, bottom currents and burrowing organisms can mix the sediment, blurring any short-term temperature spikes. For another, the timeline for each record is not known precisely, so when multiple records are averaged together to estimate past global temperature, fine-scale fluctuations can be canceled out.\nBecause of this, paleoclimate scientists are reluctant to compare the long-term record of past temperature with short-term extremes.\nEarth\u2019s average global temperature has fluctuated between glacial and interglacial conditions in cycles lasting around 100,000 years, driven largely by slow and predictable changes in Earth\u2019s orbit with attendant changes in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. We are currently in an interglacial period that began around 12,000 years ago as ice sheets retreated and greenhouse gases rose.\nLooking at that 12,000-year interglacial period, global temperature averaged over multiple centuries might have peaked roughly around 6,000 years ago, but probably did not exceed the 1 C global warming level at that point, according to the IPCC report. Another study found that global average temperatures continued to increase across the interglacial period. This is a topic of active research.\nThat means we have to look farther back to find a time that might have been as warm as today.\nThe last glacial episode lasted nearly 100,000 years. There is no evidence that long-term global temperatures reached the preindustrial baseline anytime during that period.\nIf we look even farther back, to the previous interglacial period, which peaked around 125,000 years ago, we do find evidence of warmer temperatures. The evidence suggests the long-term average temperature was probably no more than 1.5 C (2.7 F) above preindustrial levels \u2013 not much more than the current global warming level.\nWithout rapid and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, the Earth is currently on course to reach temperatures of roughly 3 C (5.4 F) above preindustrial levels by the end of the century, and possibly quite a bit higher.\nAt that point, we would need to look back millions of years to find a climate state with temperatures as hot. That would take us back to the previous geologic epoch, the Pliocene, when the Earth\u2019s climate was a distant relative of the one that sustained the rise of agriculture and civilization.\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

However, recent climate changes cannot be explained by natural causes alone.\nChanges in the earth\u2019s orbit and its axis of rotation have had a big impact on climate in the past. For example, the amount of summer sunshine on the Northern Hemisphere, which is affected by changes in the planet\u2019s orbit, appears to be the primary cause of past cycles of ice ages, in which the earth has experienced long periods of cold temperatures (ice ages), as well as shorter interglacial periods (periods between ice ages) of relatively warmer temperatures.1 At the coldest part of the last glacial period (or ice age), the average global temperature was about 11\u00b0F colder than it is today. At the peak of the last interglacial period, however, the average global temperature was at most 2\u00b0F warmer than it is today.2\nChanges in the sun\u2019s energy output can affect the intensity of the sunlight that reaches the earth\u2019s surface. While these changes can influence the earth\u2019s climate, solar variations have played little role in the climate changes observed in recent decades.3 Satellites have been measuring the amount of energy the earth receives from the sun since 1978. These measurements show no net increase in the sun\u2019s output, even as global surface temperatures have risen.4\nThe amount of sunlight that is absorbed or reflected by the planet depends on the earth\u2019s surface and atmosphere. Dark objects and surfaces, like the ocean, forests, and soil, tend to absorb more sunlight. Light-colored objects and surfaces, like snow and clouds, tend to reflect sunlight. About 70 percent of the sunlight that reaches the earth is absorbed.5 Natural changes in the earth\u2019s surface, like the melting of sea ice, have contributed to climate change in the past, often acting as feedbacks to other processes.\nVolcanoes have played a noticeable role in climate, and volcanic eruptions released large quantities of carbon dioxide in the distant past. Some explosive volcano eruptions can throw particles (e.g., SO2) into the upper atmosphere, where they can reflect enough sunlight back to space to cool the surface of the planet for several years.6 These particles are an example of cooling aerosols.\nVolcanic particles from a single eruption do not produce long-term climate change because they remain in the atmosphere for a much shorter time than greenhouse gases. In addition, human activities emit more than 100 times as much carbon dioxide as volcanoes each year.7\nOver the last several hundred thousand years, carbon dioxide levels varied in tandem with the glacial cycles. During warm interglacial periods, carbon dioxide levels were higher. During cool glacial periods, carbon dioxide levels were lower.8 The heating or cooling of the earth\u2019s surface and oceans can cause changes in the natural sources and sinks of these gases, and thus change greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.9 These changing concentrations have acted as a positive climate feedback, amplifying the temperature changes caused by long-term shifts in the earth\u2019s orbit.10\n1 National Academy of Sciences.

These scientists were interested chiefly in the possibility that a lower level of carbon dioxide gas might explain the ice ages of the distant past. At the turn of the century, Svante Arrhenius calculated that emissions from human industry might someday bring a global warming. Other scientists dismissed his idea as faulty. In 1938, G.S. Callendar argued that the level of carbon dioxide was climbing and raising global temperature, but most scientists found his arguments implausible. It was almost by chance that a few researchers in the 1950s discovered that global warming truly was possible. In the early 1960s, C.D. Keeling measured the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere: it was rising fast. Researchers began to take an interest, struggling to understand how the level of carbon dioxide had changed in the past, and how the level was influenced by chemical and biological forces. By 2000, computer calculations along with evidence from ancient climates showed unequivocally that human emissions of the gas were raising Earth's temperature. Attention turned to studying how the gas was emitted or taken up by natural systems as well as by humanity, how far the temperature would rise, and what could be done to avoid disaster by curbing emissions.

However, recent climate changes cannot be explained by natural causes alone.\nChanges in the earth\u2019s orbit and its axis of rotation have had a big impact on climate in the past. For example, the amount of summer sunshine on the Northern Hemisphere, which is affected by changes in the planet\u2019s orbit, appears to be the primary cause of past cycles of ice ages, in which the earth has experienced long periods of cold temperatures (ice ages), as well as shorter interglacial periods (periods between ice ages) of relatively warmer temperatures.1 At the coldest part of the last glacial period (or ice age), the average global temperature was about 11\u00b0F colder than it is today. At the peak of the last interglacial period, however, the average global temperature was at most 2\u00b0F warmer than it is today.2\nChanges in the sun\u2019s energy output can affect the intensity of the sunlight that reaches the earth\u2019s surface. While these changes can influence the earth\u2019s climate, solar variations have played little role in the climate changes observed in recent decades.3 Satellites have been measuring the amount of energy the earth receives from the sun since 1978. These measurements show no net increase in the sun\u2019s output, even as global surface temperatures have risen.4\nThe amount of sunlight that is absorbed or reflected by the planet depends on the earth\u2019s surface and atmosphere. Dark objects and surfaces, like the ocean, forests, and soil, tend to absorb more sunlight. Light-colored objects and surfaces, like snow and clouds, tend to reflect sunlight. About 70 percent of the sunlight that reaches the earth is absorbed.5 Natural changes in the earth\u2019s surface, like the melting of sea ice, have contributed to climate change in the past, often acting as feedbacks to other processes.\nVolcanoes have played a noticeable role in climate, and volcanic eruptions released large quantities of carbon dioxide in the distant past. Some explosive volcano eruptions can throw particles (e.g., SO2) into the upper atmosphere, where they can reflect enough sunlight back to space to cool the surface of the planet for several years.6 These particles are an example of cooling aerosols.\nVolcanic particles from a single eruption do not produce long-term climate change because they remain in the atmosphere for a much shorter time than greenhouse gases. In addition, human activities emit more than 100 times as much carbon dioxide as volcanoes each year.7\nOver the last several hundred thousand years, carbon dioxide levels varied in tandem with the glacial cycles. During warm interglacial periods, carbon dioxide levels were higher. During cool glacial periods, carbon dioxide levels were lower.8 The heating or cooling of the earth\u2019s surface and oceans can cause changes in the natural sources and sinks of these gases, and thus change greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.9 These changing concentrations have acted as a positive climate feedback, amplifying the temperature changes caused by long-term shifts in the earth\u2019s orbit.10\n1 National Academy of Sciences.

These scientists were interested chiefly in the possibility that a lower level of carbon dioxide gas might explain the ice ages of the distant past. At the turn of the century, Svante Arrhenius calculated that emissions from human industry might someday bring a global warming. Other scientists dismissed his idea as faulty. In 1938, G.S. Callendar argued that the level of carbon dioxide was climbing and raising global temperature, but most scientists found his arguments implausible. It was almost by chance that a few researchers in the 1950s discovered that global warming truly was possible. In the early 1960s, C.D. Keeling measured the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere: it was rising fast. Researchers began to take an interest, struggling to understand how the level of carbon dioxide had changed in the past, and how the level was influenced by chemical and biological forces. By 2000, computer calculations along with evidence from ancient climates showed unequivocally that human emissions of the gas were raising Earth's temperature. Attention turned to studying how the gas was emitted or taken up by natural systems as well as by humanity, how far the temperature would rise, and what could be done to avoid disaster by curbing emissions.

These scientists were interested chiefly in the possibility that a lower level of carbon dioxide gas might explain the ice ages of the distant past. At the turn of the century, Svante Arrhenius calculated that emissions from human industry might someday bring a global warming. Other scientists dismissed his idea as faulty. In 1938, G.S. Callendar argued that the level of carbon dioxide was climbing and raising global temperature, but most scientists found his arguments implausible. It was almost by chance that a few researchers in the 1950s discovered that global warming truly was possible. In the early 1960s, C.D. Keeling measured the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere: it was rising fast. Researchers began to take an interest, struggling to understand how the level of carbon dioxide had changed in the past, and how the level was influenced by chemical and biological forces. By 2000, computer calculations along with evidence from ancient climates showed unequivocally that human emissions of the gas were raising Earth's temperature. Attention turned to studying how the gas was emitted or taken up by natural systems as well as by humanity, how far the temperature would rise, and what could be done to avoid disaster by curbing emissions.

However, recent climate changes cannot be explained by natural causes alone.\nChanges in the earth\u2019s orbit and its axis of rotation have had a big impact on climate in the past. For example, the amount of summer sunshine on the Northern Hemisphere, which is affected by changes in the planet\u2019s orbit, appears to be the primary cause of past cycles of ice ages, in which the earth has experienced long periods of cold temperatures (ice ages), as well as shorter interglacial periods (periods between ice ages) of relatively warmer temperatures.1 At the coldest part of the last glacial period (or ice age), the average global temperature was about 11\u00b0F colder than it is today. At the peak of the last interglacial period, however, the average global temperature was at most 2\u00b0F warmer than it is today.2\nChanges in the sun\u2019s energy output can affect the intensity of the sunlight that reaches the earth\u2019s surface. While these changes can influence the earth\u2019s climate, solar variations have played little role in the climate changes observed in recent decades.3 Satellites have been measuring the amount of energy the earth receives from the sun since 1978. These measurements show no net increase in the sun\u2019s output, even as global surface temperatures have risen.4\nThe amount of sunlight that is absorbed or reflected by the planet depends on the earth\u2019s surface and atmosphere. Dark objects and surfaces, like the ocean, forests, and soil, tend to absorb more sunlight. Light-colored objects and surfaces, like snow and clouds, tend to reflect sunlight. About 70 percent of the sunlight that reaches the earth is absorbed.5 Natural changes in the earth\u2019s surface, like the melting of sea ice, have contributed to climate change in the past, often acting as feedbacks to other processes.\nVolcanoes have played a noticeable role in climate, and volcanic eruptions released large quantities of carbon dioxide in the distant past. Some explosive volcano eruptions can throw particles (e.g., SO2) into the upper atmosphere, where they can reflect enough sunlight back to space to cool the surface of the planet for several years.6 These particles are an example of cooling aerosols.\nVolcanic particles from a single eruption do not produce long-term climate change because they remain in the atmosphere for a much shorter time than greenhouse gases. In addition, human activities emit more than 100 times as much carbon dioxide as volcanoes each year.7\nOver the last several hundred thousand years, carbon dioxide levels varied in tandem with the glacial cycles. During warm interglacial periods, carbon dioxide levels were higher. During cool glacial periods, carbon dioxide levels were lower.8 The heating or cooling of the earth\u2019s surface and oceans can cause changes in the natural sources and sinks of these gases, and thus change greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.9 These changing concentrations have acted as a positive climate feedback, amplifying the temperature changes caused by long-term shifts in the earth\u2019s orbit.10\n1 National Academy of Sciences.

Content is not being updated or maintained, and some links may no longer work.\nThe modern record of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels began with observations recorded at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. This graph shows the station's monthly average carbon dioxide measurements since 1958 in parts per million (ppm). The seasonal cycle of highs and lows (small peaks and valleys) is driven by Northern Hemisphere summer vegetation growth, which reduces atmospheric carbon dioxide, and winter decay, which increases it. The long-term trend of rising carbon dioxide levels is driven by human activities. At Mauna Loa, the highest monthly value each year occurs in May. In May 2024, carbon dioxide hit just under 427 ppm\u2014a new record. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on Mauna Loa monthly mean data from NOAA Global Monitoring Lab.\nBased on the annual analysis from NOAA\u2019s Global Monitoring Lab, global average atmospheric carbon dioxide was 422.8 parts per million (\u201cppm,\u201d for short) in 2024, a new record high. The increase during 2024 was 3.75 ppm\u2014the largest one-year increase on record. At Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii (graph above), where the modern carbon dioxide record began in 1958, the annual average carbon dioxide in 2024 was 424.61 ppm, also a new record.\nThe years with the largest annual carbon dioxide growth tend to be associated with the strongest El Ni\u00f1os\u2014the warm phase of a natural climate pattern in the tropical Pacific\u2014which lead to high temperatures over land and sea and an expansion of global drought area. In turn, these weather conditions typically lead to less plant growth, which reduces carbon dioxide uptake, as well as increased decomposition of carbon in soil and increased carbon dioxide emissions from forest fires. Together, these impacts cause atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to rise faster than normal.\nEven though the 2023-24 El Ni\u00f1o had waned by April, record high air temperatures and drought in all of 2024, similar to those during an El Nino, were likely drivers of the large increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide in 2024. In addition to other factors, large forest fires in both the Amazon and Canada contributed to the 2024 global increase.\nCarbon dioxide concentrations are rising mostly because of the fossil fuels that people have been burning for energy since the start of the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuels like coal and oil contain the carbon from millions of years of photosynthesis\u2014the process by which plants remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. We are returning that carbon to the atmosphere in just a few hundred years. Since the middle of the 20th century, annual emissions of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels have increased every decade, from close to 11 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year in the 1960s to an estimated 37.4 billion tons in 2024 according to the Global Carbon Budget 2024.\nThe amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (blue line) has increased along with human emissions (gray line) since the start of the Industrial Revolution in 1750. Emissions rose slowly to about 5 gigatons (1 gigaton is 1 billion metric tons per year) in the mid-20th century before rapidly increasing to more than 35 billion tons per year by the end of the century. NOAA Climate.gov graph, adapted from original by Dr. Howard Diamond (NOAA ARL). Atmospheric carbon dioxide data from NOAA and ETHZ. Carbon dioxide emissions data from Our World in Data and the Global Carbon Project.\nCarbon cycle experts estimate that natural \u201csinks,\u201d including plant growth and ocean absorption, remove about half of carbon dioxide humans emit into the atmosphere from fossil fuel burning. The rest stays in the atmosphere. Every year, we are adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than natural sinks can remove, and so the total amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere goes up. The bigger the overshoot, the faster atmospheric carbon dioxide increases.\nIn the 1960s, atmospheric carbon dioxide increased by about 0.8 ppm per year on average. That growth rate doubled to an average of 1.6 ppm per year in the 1980s and 1.5 ppm per year in the 1990s. In the last decade (2015-2024), the annual increase has accelerated to 2.6 ppm per year. As a result, the annual rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide over the past 60 years is 100-200 times faster than the increase that occurred at the end of the last ice age 11,000-17,000 years ago.\nCarbon dioxide is Earth\u2019s most important long-lived greenhouse gas: a gas that absorbs and radiates heat. Unlike oxygen or nitrogen (which make up most of Earth's atmosphere), greenhouse gases absorb heat radiating from the Earth\u2019s surface and re-release it in all directions\u2014including back toward Earth\u2019s surface. Without any carbon dioxide, Earth\u2019s natural greenhouse effect would be too weak to keep the average global surface temperature above freezing.\nBy adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, people are amplifying the natural greenhouse effect, causing global temperature to rise. According to observations and analysis by the NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory, carbon dioxide alone is responsible for about 80 percent of the total heating influence of all human-produced greenhouse gases since 1990.\nAnother reason carbon dioxide is important in the Earth system is that it dissolves into the ocean like the fizz in a can of soda. It reacts with water molecules, producing carbonic acid and lowering the ocean's pH (raising its acidity). Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, the pH of the ocean's surface waters has dropped from 8.21 to 8.10. This drop in pH is called ocean acidification, and it interferes with the ability of marine life to extract calcium from sea water to build skeletons and shells.\n(left) A healthy ocean snail has a transparent shell with smoothly contoured ridges. (right) A shell exposed to more acidic, corrosive waters is cloudy, ragged, and pockmarked wit\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Just now, Lindzen is scoffing at the widely accepted view that CO2 buildup is to blame for the heat waves, prolonged droughts, and intense hurricanes that the U.S. and other countries have experienced in recent years.

He has personally briefed President Bush\u2019s top science adviser on climate change and is very popular with senior GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill. He publishes opinion pieces in The Wall Street Journal and speaks publicly several times a month, both in the U.S. and abroad.

Noting that the current atmospheric concentration of CO2 is higher than it\u2019s been in the past 650,000 years, the IPCC predicts that human-induced climate change could spell extinction for 20 to 30 percent of the world\u2019s species by the end of this century, cause increasingly destructive weather patterns, and flood coastal cities.\nLindzen doesn\u2019t dispute that the planet has warmed up in the past three decades, but he argues that human-generated CO2 accounts for no more than 30 percent of this temperature rise.

These gases are generally known as greenhouse gases (or more specifically as radiative gases). Concentrations of some of them have increased steadily during the 20th century and into the 21st, with carbon dioxide (CO2) rising from under 300 parts per million (ppm) to over 400 ppm. A large part of the increase in all greenhouse gases is attributed to human sources, i.e. it is anthropogenic, hence the term \u2018anthropogenic global warming\u2019.\nFurthermore, although most sources of anthropogenic emissions can be identified in particular countries, their effect is in no way confined to those countries \u2013 it is global.\nThe greenhouse effect itself occurs when short-wave solar radiation (which is not impeded by the greenhouse gases) heats the surface of the Earth, and the energy is radiated back through the Earth's atmosphere as heat, with a longer wavelength. In the wavelengths 5-30 \u00b5m a lot of this thermal radiation is absorbed by water vapour and carbon dioxide, which in turn radiate it, thus heating the atmosphere and land and ocean surface. This is natural and what keeps the Earth habitable. Without the greenhouse effect overnight temperatures would plunge and the average surface temperature would be about minus 18 \u00b0C, about the same as on the moon, which lacks the shroud of our atmosphere. We owe the difference of some 33 \u00b0C substantially to natural levels of water vapour (60%, or more including clouds) and carbon dioxide in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\nIn respect to enhancing the greenhouse effect, or the likelihood of AGW, the particular issue is focused in the 8-18 \u00b5m band where water vapour is a weak absorber of radiation and where the Earth's thermal radiation is greatest.* Increased concentrations of CO2 and other radiative gases here mean that less heat is lost to space from the Earth's lower atmosphere, and temperatures at the Earth's surface are therefore likely to increase. Atmosphere and oceans are the focus of attention.\n* Part of this 'window' (12.5-18 \u00b5m) is largely blocked by carbon dioxide absorption, even at the low levels originally existing in the atmosphere. The remainder of the 'window' coincides with the absorption proclivities of the other radiative gases: methane, (tropospheric) ozone, CFCs and nitrous oxide. It also appears that increased levels of carbon dioxide will increase the capture of heat in its main absorption band to some extent, though diminishing as levels increase, while more energy is absorbed in the weaker bands. As well as the band consideration, methane is a stronger greenhouse gas because it has more atoms in the molecule than CO2. The radiative effect is caused by infrared absorption, and molecules with more atoms absorb more infrared energy. IR absorption is by the electrons that bond between atoms in a molecule and the way those atoms vibrate. More bonds = more vibrations = more IR absorption. Diatomic molecules, like O2 and N2 which mostly make up our atmosphere, absorb very little IR. CO2, with two bonds, absorbs some IR, but it is the next most abundant gas so its effect is significant.\nA number of indicators suggest that atmospheric warming due to increased levels of greenhouse gases is indeed observable since 1970, despite some masking by aerosols (see below). Global air temperatures do appear to have risen about 1.1 \u00b0C over the last 120-170 years, though this has been irregular rather than steady, and does not correlate well with the steady increase in greenhouse gas \u2013 notably CO2 \u2013 concentrations. The amount, extent and rate of this exceeds natural climate variability, some of the warmest years on record have been in the last decade. However, the climate is a complex system and other factors influence global temperatures.\nOne of these is water vapour, and climate models have assumed that the direct warming effect of CO2 is amplified by water vapour. However, there is doubt about whether in practice this occurs to the extent previously thought.\nThe oceans have also warmed slightly, affecting the climate.\nThe major role of water vapour in absorbing thermal radiation is in some respects balanced by the fact that when condensed it causes an albedo effect which reflects about one-third of the incoming sunlight back into space. This effect is enhanced by atmospheric sulfate aerosols and dust, which provide condensation nuclei. Nearly half the sulfates in the atmosphere originate from sulfur dioxide emissions from power stations and industry, particularly in the northern hemisphere. Emissions of sulfates are increasingly constrained in most countries. Global sulphate emissions peaked in the early 1970s and decreased until 2000, with an increase since due mainly to increased emissions in China and from international shipping.\nVolcanoes have contributed substantially to dust and acid aerosol levels high in the atmosphere. The Mount Pinatubo eruption in 1991 in the Philippines reduced average temperatures about half a degree Celsius (\u00b0C). While at lower levels in the atmosphere sulfate aerosols and dust are short-lived, such material in the stratosphere remains for years, increasing the amount of sunlight which is reflected away.

These gases are generally known as greenhouse gases (or more specifically as radiative gases). Concentrations of some of them have increased steadily during the 20th century and into the 21st, with carbon dioxide (CO2) rising from under 300 parts per million (ppm) to over 400 ppm. A large part of the increase in all greenhouse gases is attributed to human sources, i.e. it is anthropogenic, hence the term \u2018anthropogenic global warming\u2019.\nFurthermore, although most sources of anthropogenic emissions can be identified in particular countries, their effect is in no way confined to those countries \u2013 it is global.\nThe greenhouse effect itself occurs when short-wave solar radiation (which is not impeded by the greenhouse gases) heats the surface of the Earth, and the energy is radiated back through the Earth's atmosphere as heat, with a longer wavelength. In the wavelengths 5-30 \u00b5m a lot of this thermal radiation is absorbed by water vapour and carbon dioxide, which in turn radiate it, thus heating the atmosphere and land and ocean surface. This is natural and what keeps the Earth habitable. Without the greenhouse effect overnight temperatures would plunge and the average surface temperature would be about minus 18 \u00b0C, about the same as on the moon, which lacks the shroud of our atmosphere. We owe the difference of some 33 \u00b0C substantially to natural levels of water vapour (60%, or more including clouds) and carbon dioxide in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\nIn respect to enhancing the greenhouse effect, or the likelihood of AGW, the particular issue is focused in the 8-18 \u00b5m band where water vapour is a weak absorber of radiation and where the Earth's thermal radiation is greatest.* Increased concentrations of CO2 and other radiative gases here mean that less heat is lost to space from the Earth's lower atmosphere, and temperatures at the Earth's surface are therefore likely to increase. Atmosphere and oceans are the focus of attention.\n* Part of this 'window' (12.5-18 \u00b5m) is largely blocked by carbon dioxide absorption, even at the low levels originally existing in the atmosphere. The remainder of the 'window' coincides with the absorption proclivities of the other radiative gases: methane, (tropospheric) ozone, CFCs and nitrous oxide. It also appears that increased levels of carbon dioxide will increase the capture of heat in its main absorption band to some extent, though diminishing as levels increase, while more energy is absorbed in the weaker bands. As well as the band consideration, methane is a stronger greenhouse gas because it has more atoms in the molecule than CO2. The radiative effect is caused by infrared absorption, and molecules with more atoms absorb more infrared energy. IR absorption is by the electrons that bond between atoms in a molecule and the way those atoms vibrate. More bonds = more vibrations = more IR absorption. Diatomic molecules, like O2 and N2 which mostly make up our atmosphere, absorb very little IR. CO2, with two bonds, absorbs some IR, but it is the next most abundant gas so its effect is significant.\nA number of indicators suggest that atmospheric warming due to increased levels of greenhouse gases is indeed observable since 1970, despite some masking by aerosols (see below).

However, there is doubt about whether in practice this occurs to the extent previously thought.\nThe oceans have also warmed slightly, affecting the climate.\nThe major role of water vapour in absorbing thermal radiation is in some respects balanced by the fact that when condensed it causes an albedo effect which reflects about one-third of the incoming sunlight back into space. This effect is enhanced by atmospheric sulfate aerosols and dust, which provide condensation nuclei. Nearly half the sulfates in the atmosphere originate from sulfur dioxide emissions from power stations and industry, particularly in the northern hemisphere. Emissions of sulfates are increasingly constrained in most countries. Global sulphate emissions peaked in the early 1970s and decreased until 2000, with an increase since due mainly to increased emissions in China and from international shipping.\nVolcanoes have contributed substantially to dust and acid aerosol levels high in the atmosphere.
