    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nWhat if I told you there was something that you can do right now that would have an immediate, positive benefit for your brain including your mood and your focus? And what if I told you that same thing could actually last a long time and protect your brain from different conditions like depression, Alzheimer's disease or dementia. Would you do it? Yes! I am talking about the powerful effects of physical activity. Simply moving your body, has immediate, long-lasting and protective benefits for your brain. And that can last for the rest of your life. So what I want to do today is tell you a story about how I used my deep understanding of neuroscience, as a professor of neuroscience, to essentially do an experiment on myself in which I discovered the science underlying why exercise is the most transformative thing that you can do for your brain today. Now, as a neuroscientist, I know that our brains, that is the thing in our head right now, that is the most complex structure known to humankind. But it's one thing to talk about the brain, and it's another to see it. So here is a real preserved human brain. And it's going to illustrate two key areas that we are going to talk about today. The first is the prefrontal cortex, right behind your forehead, critical for things like decision-making, focus, attention and your personality. The second key area is located in the temporal lobe, shown right here. You have two temporal lobes in your brain, the right and the left, and deep in the temporal lobe is a key structure critical for your ability to form and retain new long-term memories for facts and events. And that structure is called the hippocampus. So I've always been fascinated with the hippocampus. How could it be that an event that lasts just a moment, say, your first kiss, or the moment your first child was born, can form a memory that has changed your brain, that lasts an entire lifetime? That's what I want to understand. I wanted to start and record the activity of individual brain cells in the hippocampus as subjects were forming new memories. And essentially try and decode how those brief bursts of electrical activity, which is how neurons communicate with each other, how those brief bursts either allowed us to form a new memory, or did not. But a few years ago, I did something very unusual in science. As a full professor of neural science, I decided to completely switch my research program. Because I encountered something that was so amazing, with the potential to change so many lives that I had to study it. I discovered and I experienced the brain-changing effects of exercise. And I did it in a completely inadvertent way. I was actually at the height of all the memory work that I was doing -- data was pouring in, I was becoming known in my field for all of this memory work. And it should have been going great. It was, scientifically. But when I stuck my head out of my lab door, I noticed something. I had no social life. I spent too much time listening to those brain cells in a dark room, by myself. (Laughter) I didn't move my body at all. I had gained 25 pounds. And actually, it took me many years to realize it, I was actually miserable. And I shouldn't be miserable. And I went on a river-rafting trip -- by myself, because I had no social life. And I came back -- (Laughter) thinking, \"Oh, my God, I was the weakest person on that trip.\" And I came back with a mission. I said, \"I'm never going to feel like the weakest person on a river-rafting trip again.\" And that's what made me go to the gym. And I focused my type-A personality on going to all the exercise classes at the gym. I tried everything. I went to kickbox, dance, yoga, step class, and at first it was really hard. But what I noticed is that after every sweat-inducing workout that I tried, I had this great mood boost and this great energy boost. And that's what kept me going back to the gym. Well, I started feeling stronger. I started feeling better, I even lost that 25 pounds. And now, fast-forward a year and a half into this regular exercise program and I noticed something that really made me sit up and take notice. I was sitting at my desk, writing a research grant, and a thought went through my mind that had never gone through my mind before. And that thought was, \"Gee, grant-writing is going well today.\" And all the scientists -- (Laughter) yeah, all the scientists always laugh when I say that, because grant-writing never goes well. It is so hard; you're always pulling your hair out, trying to come up with that million-dollar-winning idea. But I realized that the grant-writing was going well, because I was able to focus and maintain my attention for longer than I had before. And my long-term memory -- what I was studying in my own lab -- seemed to be better in me. And that's when I put it together. Maybe all that exercise that I had included and added to my life was changing my brain. Maybe I did an experiment on myself without even knowing it. So as a curious neuroscientist, I went to the literature to see what I could find about what we knew about the effects of exercise on the brain. And what I found was an exciting and a growing literature that was essentially showing everything that I noticed in myself. Better mood, better energy, better memory, better attention. And the more I learned, the more I realized how powerful exercise was. Which eventually led me to the big decision to completely shift my research focus. And so now, after several years of really focusing on this question, I've come to the following conclusion: that exercise is the most transformative thing that you can do for your brain today for the following three reasons. Number one: it has immediate effects on your brain. A single workout that you do will immediately increase levels of neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline. That is going to increase your mood right after that workout, exactly what I was feeling. My lab showed that a single workout can improve your ability to shift and focus attention, and that focus improvement will last for at least two hours. And finally, studies have shown that a single workout will improve your reaction times which basically means that you are going to be faster at catching that cup of Starbucks that falls off the counter, which is very, very important. (Laughter) But these immediate effects are transient, they help you right after. What you have to do is do what I did, that is change your exercise regime, increase your cardiorespiratory function, to get the long-lasting effects. And these effects are long-lasting because exercise actually changes the brain's anatomy, physiology and function. Let's start with my favorite brain area, the hippocampus. The hippocampus -- or exercise actually produces brand new brain cells, new brain cells in the hippocampus, that actually increase its volume, as well as improve your long-term memory, OK? And that including in you and me. Number two: the most common finding in neuroscience studies, looking at effects of long-term exercise, is improved attention function dependent on your prefrontal cortex. You not only get better focus and attention, but the volume of the hippocampus increases as well. And finally, you not only get immediate effects of mood with exercise but those last for a long time. So you get long-lasting increases in those good mood neurotransmitters. But really, the most transformative thing that exercise will do is its protective effects on your brain. Here you can think about the brain like a muscle. The more you're working out, the bigger and stronger your hippocampus and prefrontal cortex gets. Why is that important? Because the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus are the two areas that are most susceptible to neurodegenerative diseases and normal cognitive decline in aging. So with increased exercise over your lifetime, you're not going to cure dementia or Alzheimer's disease, but what you're going to do is you're going to create the strongest, biggest hippocampus and prefrontal cortex so it takes longer for these diseases to actually have an effect. You can think of exercise, therefore, as a supercharged 401K for your brain, OK? And it's even better, because it's free. So this is the point in the talk where everybody says, \"That sounds so interesting, Wendy, but I really will only want to know one thing. And that is, just tell me the minimum amount of exercise I need to get all these changes.\" (Laughter) And so I'm going to tell you the answer to that question. First, good news: you don't have to become a triathlete to get these effects. The rule of thumb is you want to get three to four times a week exercise minimum 30 minutes an exercise session, and you want to get aerobic exercise in. That is, get your heart rate up. And the good news is, you don't have to go to the gym to get a very expensive gym membership. Add an extra walk around the block in your power walk. You see stairs -- take stairs. And power-vacuuming can be as good as the aerobics class that you were going to take at the gym. So I've gone from memory pioneer to exercise explorer. From going into the innermost workings of the brain, to trying to understand how exercise can improve our brain function, and my goal in my lab right now is to go beyond that rule of thumb that I just gave you -- three to four times a week, 30 minutes. I want to understand the optimum exercise prescription for you, at your age, at your fitness level, for your genetic background, to maximize the effects of exercise today and also to improve your brain and protect your brain the best for the rest of your life. But it's one thing to talk about exercise, and it's another to do it. So I'm going to invoke my power as a certified exercise instructor, to ask you all to stand up. (Laughter) We're going to do just one minute of exercise. It's call-and-response, just do what I do, say what I say, and make sure you don't punch your neighbor, OK? Music! (Upbeat music) Five, six, seven, eight, it's right, left, right, left. And I say, I am strong now. Let's hear you. Audience: I am strong now. Wendy Suzuki: Ladies, I am Wonder Woman-strong. Let's hear you! Audience: I am Wonder Woman-strong. WS: New move -- uppercut, right and left. I am inspired now. You say it! Audience: I am inspired now. WS: Last move -- pull it down, right and left, right and left. I say, I am on fire now! You say it. Audience: I am on fire now. WS: And done! OK, good job! (Applause) Thank you. I want to leave you with one last thought. And that is, bringing exercise in your life will not only give you a happier, more protective life today, but it will protect your brain from incurable diseases. And in this way it will change the trajectory of your life for the better. Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)",

While the benefit of exercise has been observed in humans of all ages, the availability of preclinical models has permitted systematic investigations into the mechanisms by which exercise supports and protects the brain. Over the past twenty-five years, rodent models have shown that increased physical activity elevates neurotrophic factors in the hippocampal and cortical areas, facilitating neurotransmission throughout the brain. Increased physical activity (such as by the voluntary use of a running wheel or regular, timed sessions on a treadmill) also promotes proliferation, maturation and survival of cells in the dentate gyrus, contributing to the process of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. In this way, rodent studies have tremendous value as they demonstrate that an \u2018active lifestyle\u2019 has the capacity to ameliorate a number of age\u2013related changes in the brain, including the decline in adult neurogenesis. Moreover, these studies have shown that greater physical activity may protect the brain health into advanced age through a number of complimentary mechanisms: in addition to upregulating factors in pro-survival neurotrophic pathways and enhancing synaptic plasticity, increased physical activity promotes brain health by supporting the cerebrovasculature, sustaining the integrity of the blood\u2013brain barrier, increasing glymphatic clearance and proteolytic degradation of amyloid beta species, and regulating microglia activation. Collectively, preclinical studies demonstrate that exercise initiates diverse and powerful neuroprotective pathways that may converge to promote continued brain health into old age. This review will draw on both seminal and current literature that highlights mechanisms by which exercise supports the functioning of the brain, and aids in its protection.\nRegular exercise plays essential role in maintaining a healthy lifestyle. It bolsters the cardiovascular, and immune and metabolic systems and in addition, modulates the internal milieu of the brain [1\u20136]. Both acute, high-intensity activity and regular, moderate aerobic exercise have been reported to increase levels of circulating neurotrophic factors and enhance neurotransmission, exerting beneficial effects on mood and cognitive functions in individuals of all ages [7\u201316]. In young adults, an acute bout of high-intensity cycling induced an increase in serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) that correlated with blood lacate [7], as did long-term exercise of moderate intensity (i.e. 5 weeks of cycling, 3 times per week, at intensities below the ventilatory threshold) [8]; both regimens correlated with improved cognitive performance. Adults over 65 years of age that participated in regular exercise (e.g. walking, hiking, biking, weight-training, stretching, or others) score higher on common memory tests and have been shown to be at a reduced risk for dementia and impairment in executive functions associated with advancing age [17\u201321]. These benefits often correlated with measures such as frequency and/or intensity of exercise, and caloric expenditure. Exercise such as walking, aerobic exercise, and strength training, was also shown to improve executive functions and cognition in individuals already suffering from early stages of dementia [18, 22\u201324]. To this end, the importance of exercise in supporting continued brain health in the aging brain, even individuals affected by the early stages of neurodegeneration, is gaining recognition. Moreover, because studies suggest that physical activity can reduce the risk of cognitive decline, an active lifestyle can be thought of as a \u2018preventative\u2019 strategy to ameliorate the deterioration of brain health much as it is with cardiovascular dysfunction.\nIn humans, age-related changes in the brain commonly underlie cognitive decline; these may include progressive reductions in neurotrophic levels, alterations in the cerebrovasculature, and declining neurogenesis [25\u201334]. The hippocampus is particularly vulnerable to age-related morphological and functional alterations [34\u201339]. Similar age-related alterations have been observed in rodents, making them an ideal model for identifying changes that occur on a cellular level and for investigating interventional or preventative strategies [40\u201343]. As in humans, rodent models have shown age\u2013related reductions in hippocampal volume [38, 44, 45]. This is, in part, a consequence of a decline in cell proliferation [46, 47] and morphologic changes in the rodent brain, such as reductions in dendritic branching, spine densities, and fibres projecting into the hippocampus [38, 42, 43, 45, 48\u201351]. In addition, advanced age in both rodents and humans have been associated with a reduction in trophic support to the brain, such as declining levels of BDNF and its full-length receptor, tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) [35, 37, 42]. The loss of neurotrophic support is concomitant with attenuated neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity [29, 36, 43, 48, 50, 52, 53]. Importantly, age-related neurological changes correlate with functional decline, particularly in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory tasks, and navigational strategies [5, 54\u201359].\nNotably, though the hippocampus is known to be a principle site of mammalian adult neurogenesis [60], there has been some discrepancy as to whether this occurs in humans [61\u201365]. A recent paper by Sorrells and colleagues found no evidence for neurogenesis beyond youth [64], while Boldrini et al. published a paper shortly thereafter showing that neurogenesis did in fact persist into adulthood, with a small age-related decline [61], in keeping with previous studies [62, 65]. Indeed, numerous studies have suggested that adult-born neural stem cells may be stimulat\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

It is ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nMayo Clinic offers appointments in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota and at Mayo Clinic Health System locations.\nExercise in almost any form can act as a stress reliever. Being active can boost your feel-good endorphins and distract you from daily worries.\nYou know that exercise does your body good. But you're too busy and stressed to fit it into your daily plan. There's good news when it comes to exercise and stress.\nAlmost any form of exercise, from aerobics to yoga, can act as a stress reliever. If you're not an athlete or you're out of shape, you can still use exercise to help manage your stress.\nFind the connection between exercise and stress relief, and learn why exercise should be part of your stress management plan.\nExercise improves your health and sense of well-being, which gives you more energy every day. Exercise also has some clear benefits to relieve your stress.\nThis can have positive effects on the body \u2014 including the heart and blood vessels, digestive. and immune systems \u2014 helping protect against harmful results of stress. For example, it can lower resting heart rate and blood pressure, and help improve the immune system. It can even lessen the effects of aging.\nAs you start to regularly shed your daily tensions through movement and physical activity, you may find that this focus on a single task helps you stay calm. It can increase your energy and optimism. It can help you focus and think clearly, and it even can help you use your imagination and improve problem-solving skills.\nA successful exercise program begins with a few simple steps.\nWalk before you run. Start slowly and build up your activity level gradually. Excitement about a new exercise plan can lead to overdoing it and possibly even injury.\nMost healthy adults should get at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity each week. You can mix the two types. Examples of moderate aerobic activity include brisk walking, biking or swimming. Vigorous aerobic activity can include running or swimming laps.\nAim to exercise most days of the week. For even more benefits, and to help keep or speed up weight loss, get 300 minutes or more of moderate aerobic activity each week. Also, aim to do strength training exercises for all major muscle groups at least two times a week.\nDo what you love. Almost any form of exercise or movement can increase your fitness level while decreasing your stress. The most important thing is to pick an activity that you enjoy. For example, you might try walking, stair climbing, jogging, dancing, bicycling, yoga, tai chi, gardening, weightlifting or swimming.\nAnd remember, you don't need to join a gym to get moving. Take a walk with the dog, try body-weight exercises or do a yoga video at home.\nStarting an exercise plan is just the first step. Here are some tips for sticking with a new exercise plan or refreshing a tired workout:\nSet SMART goals. Write down SMART goals \u2014 specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and timely goals.\nFor example, find a specific time to exercise that works for you. If your main goal is to lower stress, you could make a specific goal to walk during your lunch hour three times a week. Or try a goal such as doing online fitness videos at home two evenings a week. If needed, find a babysitter to watch your children so that you can attend a cycling class once a week. Some gyms even offer child care.\nExercise in short bursts. Even small amounts of physical activity can be helpful. Being active during the day can add up and have health benefits. For instance, if you can't fit in one 30-minute walk, try a few 10-minute walks instead. Take a midmorning or afternoon break to move and stretch, go for a walk, or do some squats or pushups.\nOr try interval training, which involves short bursts (30 to 60 seconds) of intense activity at almost full effort. This type of exercise can be a safe, effective and efficient way of gaining many of the benefits of longer duration exercise.\nWhat's most important is making physical activity part of your lifestyle every week. Don't think of exercise as one more thing on your to-do list. Find an activity you enjoy and make it part of your weekly and daily plan. Maybe you enjoy an active tennis or pickleball match, or maybe you like a meditative walk down the street. Any form of physical activity can help you unwind and become an important part of your approach to easing stress.\nSign up for free and stay up to date on research advancements, health tips, current health topics, and expertise on managing health.

An ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nExercise boosts physical capabilities and can even change physical appearance, but it also improves the condition of the brain and cognition. BYU cell biology and physiology professor Jeff Edwards\u2019 research findings validate those new year\u2019s resolutions to get the heart pumping and exercise more. He provides information on three ways that exercise affects the mind and can improve quality of life.\nExercise feeds the brain Exercise increases blood flow to the brain. Due to its high metabolic demand, the brain demands good circulation, and exercise aids it. An increase in blood flow is not only extremely beneficial, it is essential. Exercise induces good blood flow to deliver all the nutrients required to carry out the brain\u2019s job, while it also increases production molecules important to brain function, including memory.\nExercise secures priceless memories People hold their memories dear, yet, in reality, we only remember a fraction of our lives. Accessing memories, writing them down, and sharing them with others helps solidify their presence in the brain, but exercising improves memory\u2019s capacity and strength.\nExercise improves memory by increasing molecular targets like the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). This molecular factor increases synaptogenesis, forming new synapses that mediate learning and memory, making it easier to absorb information and form long-term memories. The more BDNF, the more the memory improves in function and capacity. If you aren\u2019t motivated to work out, consider how priceless your memories are and start moving to preserve them.\nExercise lowers stress impact Exercise is not a direct solution to stress, but it does pacify the experience. It is important to note that exercise does not decrease stress hormones, but it does decrease the number of stress receptors in the hippocampus. Reducing stress receptors minimizes the effect of stress hormones on the brain, decreasing the impact of stressful experiences.\nThe phenomenon most commonly known as \u201crunner\u2019s high\u201d is another stress-related benefit of exercise. Working out stimulates the release of endorphins that act on opiate receptors in the brain to create the blissful feeling of a workout high. This euphoric sensation can be felt during or after any workout and is paired with a reduction in feelings of anxiety and depression. Exercise is an indirect but effective treatment for stress.\nLife Science Lifestyle: connecting you to science The Lifestyle series provides practical tips to enhance the quality of your every-day life through the outstanding scientific expertise and research of the faculty within the eight departments of the College of Life Sciences.\nCollege of Life Sciences Life Sciences Building (LSB) Provo, Utah 84602 - Dean's Suite: 801-422-1458 Advisement Center: 801-422-3042\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of dementia, is by no means an inevitable consequence of growing old. Several lifestyle factors may increase, or reduce, an individual's risk of developing AD. Much has been written over the ages about the benefits of exercise and physical activity. Among the risk factors associated with AD is a low level of physical activity. The relationship between physical and mental health was established several years ago. In this review, we discuss the role of exercise (aerobic and resistance) training as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment and prevention of AD. Older adults who exercise are more likely to maintain cognition. We address the main protective mechanism on brain function modulated by physical exercise by examining both human and animal studies. We will pay especial attention to the potential role of exercise in the modulation of amyloid \u03b2 turnover, inflammation, synthesis and release of neurotrophins, and improvements in cerebral blood flow. Promoting changes in lifestyle in presymptomatic and predementia disease stages may have the potential for delaying one-third of dementias worldwide. Multimodal interventions that include the adoption of an active lifestyle should be recommended for older populations.\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia and one of the most frequent neurodegenerative pathologies in elderly people, constituting about 90% of the cases of dementia in this population. AD is characterized by its irreversibility and progressive functional, cognitive, and behavioral loss. It is usually accompanied by various brain disorders such as amnesia, agnosia, apraxia, and aphasia.1\nTwenty-four million people in the world suffer from AD, and it is expected that by 2050 this number will be 4 times greater.2 These alarming numbers are explained by the fact that the main risk factor for this disease is age,3 and by 2050 it is estimated that the population over 65 years will be 3 times larger than it was in 2010, reaching close to 1.5 billion people.\nAD is a devastating disease. The social and human cost for patients and caregivers is overwhelming, and the economic cost of AD is unaffordable. For instance, in the United States in 2017, the annual cost of care per patient over 65 with AD or another type of dementia was USD 48,000, or 3.5 times more than for a person without any type of dementia.4,5\nAD is characterized by the loss of neuronal synapses and pyramidal neurons accompanied by progressive cognitive neurodegeneration.6 The regions associated with more complex brain functions, such as the hippocampus and the neocortex, are the most affected.\nAlthough there are several hypotheses to explain the origin of AD, the 2 main neuropathological features include the extracellular accumulation of senile plaques around the neurons and the glia, and the intracellular formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Senile plaques are formed mainly by the accumulation of insoluble amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) protein, especially its isoform A\u03b242, which is formed by the enzymatic cleavage of the transmembrane amyloid precursor protein (APP).7,8 NFTs are formed from the hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein. The main function of this protein is to stabilize the microtubules so that they connect with other elements of the neuronal cytoskeleton, such as neurofilaments and actin.9\nAnother feature in AD is the inflammatory response at the brain level. In the early stages of the disease, the immune response results in a removal of A\u03b2, ameliorating its symptoms.10,11 To generate a balance between the deposition and the clearance of A\u03b2, microglia plays a fundamental role by engulfing insoluble deposits of this peptide through the activation of receptors that promote phagocytic action, such as cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36), and receptors for advanced-glycosylation end products.12,13 Microglia also activates extracellular proteases such as neprilysin, the insulin degrading enzyme, endothelin converting enzyme 1, angiotensin converting enzyme, matrix metalloprotease, and the presequence peptidase.14, 15, 16 During advanced stages of the disease there is a prolonged stimulation of the immune response caused by A\u03b2, which leads to a decrease in the efficiency of the microglia to degrade it.17 In turn, this leads to the release of several proinflammatory products, such as cytokines, reactive oxygen, and nitrogen species, leading to an increase in the production of A\u03b2 and the hyperphosphorylation of tau, generating more damage and neuronal death.18, 19, 20 This state contributes to an increase in cognitive decline and the development of the disease.\nThe risk factors associated with AD, apart from age, are low educational level, diabetes, genetics, belonging to certain minority ethnic groups (prevalence of dementia is higher in British African\u2013Caribbean people),21 diet, previous brain injuries, sleep disorders, hypertension, hearing loss, and low levels of physical activity.22 Physical activity (\u201cany movement of the body\u201d) and exercise (\u201cphysical activity that is typified by specific and purposeful training\u201d) constitute 2 different concepts.23 However, for the sake of clarity we refer to both these concepts interchangeably since some of the reports we refer to in this review use these expressions as synonyms. Older adults are considered physically active when they perform moderate-intensity aerobic physical act\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

It can improve memory and reduce anxiety or depression.\nRegular physical activity can also improve signs of brain health, and short bursts of physical activity can boost brain functions such as memory and thinking skills1. What\u2019s more, regular physical activity can reduce your risk of cognitive decline and dementia. In fact, the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recognizes prevention of dementia (including Alzheimer's) as a benefit of participating in moderate to vigorous intensity activity, which can include brisk walking, swimming, dancing, and even doing household chores2. The mechanisms for this are not completely known but could include hormonal changes3 and changes to brain volume45.\nRegular physical activity can help you sleep and feel better, reduce the risk of some common cancers and other diseases such heart diseases and diabetes, and add years to your life.\nYou don't have to be a fitness guru to reap the benefits. No matter your age or fitness level, any amount of physical activity can help.\nFor the most benefit, adults need at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity weekly or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity. It doesn't have to happen in one stretch. For example, moderate-intensity activity could be broken into 22 minutes daily, 30 minutes a day on 5 days a week, or smaller amounts that add up.\nSee a sample schedule for adults.\nAll adults also need muscle-strengthening activities two or more days a week. And adults 65 and older need activities to improve balance as well.\nSee a sample schedule for older adults.\nHere are ways to be more physically active:\nTurn up the music and dance. Twisting and turning can be a fun way to be physically active.\nTake active breaks. Break up your sedentary time with physical activity. For example, squat or march in place between programs while you're watching television. Or stand on one leg to improve your balance.\nAdd physical activity to your routine. When shopping, park at the back of the parking lot and walk to the shop. Inside, walk around the perimeter of the store before getting what you need. Use the stairs instead of the elevator. Get off transit one stop sooner and walk to your destination. If you already walk routinely, start carrying hand weights on your treks.\nWalk the dog. Dogs are great walking companions and can help you have an active lifestyle. One study found that dog owners on average walk 22 minutes more every day compared to people who don't own a dog. If you already walk your dog, try going a little further on your walks.\nRemember that some activity is better than none, and every little bit counts. Even some chores such as raking and bagging leaves, using a lawn mower, or vacuuming can help you get active.\nGet started by keeping track of your daily activities for one week with this diary. Think about times throughout the day you could be physically active. Make those times a regular part of your daily or weekly schedule.

It preserves muscle strength; keeps your heart strong; maintains a healthy body weight; and staves off chronic diseases such as diabetes.\nBut exercise has brain benefits too. Many studies have suggested that the parts of the brain that control thinking and memory are larger in volume in people who exercise than in people who don't. One finding is that engaging in a program of regular exercise of moderate intensity over six months or a year is associated with an increase in the volume of selected brain regions.\nExercise can also boost memory and thinking indirectly by improving mood and sleep, and by reducing stress and anxiety. Problems in these areas frequently cause or contribute to cognitive impairment.\nIs one exercise better than another in terms of brain health? We don't know the answer to this question, because almost all of the research so far has looked at one form of exercise: walking. \"But it's likely that other forms of aerobic exercise that get your heart pumping might yield similar benefits,\" explains Dr. Scott McGinnis, assistant professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School.\nA study published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society found that tai chi may enhance cognitive function in older adults, especially in executive function, which manages cognitive processes such as planning, working memory, attention, problem solving, and verbal reasoning. That may be because tai chi, a martial art that involves slow, focused movements, requires learning and memorizing new skills and movement patterns.\nDr. McGinnis recommends establishing exercise as a habit, almost like taking a prescription medication. Aim for a goal of exercising at a moderate intensity \u2014 such as brisk walking \u2014 for 150 minutes per week. Start with a few minutes a day and increase the amount by five or 10 minutes every week until you reach your goal.\nAnd since several studies have shown that it takes about six months to start reaping the cognitive benefits of exercise, he reminds you to be patient as you look for the first results \u2014 and to continue exercising for life.\nFor additional advice and tips to help you get the most from your workouts, read the Workout Workbook, a Special Health Report from Harvard Medical School.\nImage: monkeybusinessimages/Getty Images\nAs a service to our readers, Harvard Health Publishing provides access to our library of archived content.
