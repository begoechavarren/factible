    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nhi everyone this is monty i've been doing some investigation into the floor nation of our uh water here in lebanon oregon and i got a letter from the harvard university they posted in the federal government's journal confirms that fluoride lowers iqs and that was on july 27 2012. you can you can most likely find it in uh just by typing in but you can see it's a major harvard university study that confirms that the fluorination of our city water lowers our children's iq now you would think that that would cause writing in the streets demanding that we would have fluoride removed from our water but ironically it doesn't another study this one done by harvard university on july 26th that says it was published in the national institute of health journal finds that fluoride lowers children's iq that's the florida nation of your city water and this is the article right here again it's a harvard university study now both of those were done in this year and you would think that as soon as the american people found out for sure through harvard university after they've done extensive studies that the fluoridation of our water supply causes our children redox retardation making our children's iqs lower causing problems and and families and health you think that people would uh be freaking out and getting the flu right out you think we wouldn't even have to ask our governments and our townships to remove the fluoride fluoride from our water they don't do it you have to fight tooth and now and chances are they're sterile aren't going to do it but if you're not worried about lowering iqs you know everybody says oh my kid's stupid you know we're used to hearing it but here's another release published in april 5th 2006 another one from harvard university studies shows a link between fluorinated water and bone cancer in boys so you know it just goes on and on it's just link after link all of these studies from harvard university uh not to mention the 3600 000 other studies that have been done by numerous people that just plagues this whole fluoridation of water and that people aren't doing anything about it they're not stopping it why is this being put in our water when it is causing the iqs of our children to be lowered causing uh all kinds of problems now here's a great thing me and my girl went to see her obgyn the other day and she had some work done on her while i was in the office i was talking to this specialist with women and children this lady is a doctor who specializes in child rearing and and women issues and stuff and i asked her what she knew about fluoride and she said that she strongly recommends that babies be fed special water that has been specially more foreign more fluorination put in the baby's water for the use of their uh for for their feedings and i asked her if she looked into it she said she felt some concerns about the recent stories of uh you know how fluoride is linked in in brain damage and she she said she hadn't really looked into it too much and i said well i just got you know i told her the story i just got this information on july 26 27th that uh from harvard saying that they definitely have confirmed it does lower uh children's iq and she said for years she'd been telling mothers of newborn babies to buy fluorinated water to feed their babies to put in their babies bottles so that their baby's teeth would be better and stronger well here's an interesting note the nurse that was helping this doctor says hey wait a minute uh i come from austin texas and they have natural fluorination of the water there where the water is over fluorinated and everybody in the town all the town of 300 000 people have white pitted stuff on their teeth and uh she said and everybody in the town acts literally like a bunch of dumbasses those are her words not mine she said that it's just a bunch of hooligans and everybody's kind of hillbilly mentality real low iq individuals and of course their waters naturally overflowed fluorinated it's called uh fluorination opmosis or something like that when you have too much fluorine in your body you get uh white spots on your teeth now here's just a thought if you know anybody with white spots on their teeth ask them a couple of simple questions and see if they're a dumbass because from what i hear from this nurse the people over in austin texas or somewhere around that uh all live in a town where the water has too much fluorine in it naturally and they're all a bunch of dumbasses uh hicks you know she this is her words not mine i i don't know i live in lebanon oregon and uh at any rate get sidetracked here there's all these studies out there saying that uh people who generally are angry and have gang-related problems and are fighting and are criminals usually have lower iqs people who are afraid when you become afraid your iq automatically goes down you lose a couple of points when you get really scared also when you get really angry you lose a couple of points you know it's briefly that's why people who get angry do stupid things what happens when you feed a baby from birth fluorinated water and they drink it their whole life haven't you noticed lately that our kids in america or just slightly not normal i have and i'm only 46 years old and i've noticed a huge decline in intelligence in our kids and i believe the world steady on children's iqs america's kids come in way under the mark like a hundred in the world our children that are being fed by by our country fluoride have the lowest iqs in in the world i mean there's a few countries that are lower in ours but i'm not even really sure there's anybody living there anyway these are just my views and they're backed with you know facts and i did talk to an ogbyn who said that she was recommending that babies drink specially high fluorinated water babies teeth fall out and they get new ones wouldn't it make more sense to wait until they were older to drink fluorinated water however fluoride isn't something that's brought in through the body system through digestion it's a topical thing if you go to a dentist the dentist puts it in a cup and sticks it on your teeth it's because it's absorbed through the teeth it's not absorbed through the body by drinking it and what what parts of it is is absorbed through it would require large amounts for it to do anything your teeth uh hence austin texas and then getting the white spots on their teeth look this stuff up it's on the internet i would like everybody to go and stop the fluorination of water and i think that we need to investigate how this stuff got put in and what is behind it now some people say well monty you're just a conspiracy theorist well that may very well be true but at least if i'm a conspiracy theorist then these people over in the harvard university need to be tarred and feathered because they're saying the same thing i am fluoride makes our children a bunch of retards anyways if you have any thoughts about this feel free to uh drop me a message also you know share this information and hit like on there and also uh subscribe thank you have a good day",

    "input_prompt": "Claim:\nFluoridation of water causes children's IQs to lower, leading to health problems.\n\nArticle Title:\nDoes Fluoride Lower IQ Scores? - I Like My Teeth\n\nGoogle Search Snippet:\nExposure to fluoridated water during the first five years of life was not associated with altered measures of child emotional and behavioral development and ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAmerica has been preventing tooth decay with fluoridated water for over 80 years. Fluoridation is effective, safe and benefits everyone regardless of age or income. About 3 out of 4 people in U.S. communities enjoy fluoridated water. So, until recently, questions about fluoride and IQ were rare.\nStudies conducted in New Zealand and Sweden showed that the IQ scores of adolescents and adults living in fluoridated communities during infancy and childhood were no different than the scores of people who lived in unfluoridated communities. These two studies are uniquely robust because they tracked IQ and other possible effects in large numbers of participants over a long period of time, well into adulthood.\nOpponents of fluoridation began focusing on IQ after the 2012 publication of a systematic review of 27 studies from around the world. Opponents claimed that this review showed that lower IQ scores in children were \u201ccaused\u201d by fluoride. There are many reasons why the evidence does not support this claim.\nIn recent years, opponents have focused on prenatal exposure to fluoride, with studies from Mexico City and Canada, where fluoride exposure is similar to U.S. and Canadian communities. These studies reported some differences in the IQ scores of 3 and 4 year olds related to the level of fluoride their mothers were exposed to. However, the Canadian study showed a significant difference only for boys \u2014 and only on one of the two tests.\nMany issues have been raised about the quality of the studies from Mexico City and Canada and, importantly, the results have not been confirmed by other research teams.\nThe Canadian studies are based on a single data set that was not designed to measure a mother\u2019s exposure to fluoride and how it might affect the IQ of offspring. This recently published analysis cites authoritative sources that dismiss the validity of both the measure of the individual mothers\u2019 exposures to fluoride and how the IQ of their children were tested.\nAny study of IQ differences must take into account the many factors that affect intelligence scores. Some of these include breastfeeding, nutrition, and mothers\u2019 IQ. Researchers work to account for these factors to increase confidence that a study\u2019s results are not skewed or otherwise affected.\nThe studies from Mexico City and Canada accounted for some but not all these factors. They relied on IQ testing that was conducted at only one age. By contrast, the New Zealand study tested IQ several times, starting at age 7 and ending at age 38. The fact that multiple test scores were collected, and over 31 year a period time, means that we can have more confidence in these results over others.\nIn 2015, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) initiated a review of studies on fluoride and possible effects on neurodevelopment. Before its publication in 2024, the NTP sought peer-review of its work, choosing the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. After performing two reviews, the National Academies concluded that the NTP had not identified \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence to support its initial claim that fluoride causes low IQ. As a result, the NTP had to remove its classification of fluoride as a \u201chazard\u201d.\nGoing one step further, the National Academies instructed the NTP to state very clearly that the studies it reviewed did not adequately examine exposure to low levels of fluoride, \u201cincluding those typically associated with drinking-water fluoridation.\u201d Although NTP\u2019s report found an association between high fluoride concentrations and lower IQ in children where fluoride levels exceeded WHO guidelines (1.5 mg/L), that is more than twice the 0.7 mg/L level of fluoridation in the U.S. and Canada.\nThe authors of the NTP report also publish a meta-analysis within which they acknowledged that three low-risk-of-bias studies on fluoride levels under 1.5 mg/L showed no association of fluoride with children\u2019s IQ. These findings are consistent with a meta-analysis conducted by other researchers who examined eight studies conducted in areas with water fluoridation comparable to the U.S., below 1.5 mg/L. They, too, found no association between fluoride exposure and IQ.\nNonetheless, publication of the meta-analysis spurred immediate criticism. Defects serious enough to call for retraction of the meta-analysis were enumerated in another such critique which concluded, \u201cWe further find major problems with the sources employed, including reliance on studies from non-MEDLINE indexed publications with an anti-fluoridation editorial stance, and major underlying issues with the data reported in several instances, indicative of impossible or unreliable data. Taylor et al is not reliable nor are its errors remediable. It should be retracted to avoid harms to public health and scientific discourse.\u201d\nIn 2021, a study from Spain agreed with the 2019 Canadian study that mothers\u2019 prenatal fluoride exposure was not associated with any difference in girls\u2019 IQ. However, it had an opposite finding regarding boys, finding higher cognitive scores in boys at age 4, not lower. A much larger 2022 study in Australia followed boys and girls with different lifetime fluoride exposures from birth to age 5. This study assessed the children\u2019s emotional and behavioral development later, before they reached age 18. Their conclusion? Exposure to fluoridated water during the first five years of life was not associated with altered measures of child emotional and behavioral development and executive functioning.\nMore than 7,000 studies and research papers have been conducted on fluoridation, and the overwhelming evidence demonstrates its safety and benefits. This enormous body of research and over 80 years of public health practice consistently point to the effectiveness and safety of fluoride use in the U.S.\nScience looks for patterns. The public is well-served when research \u2013 from process to data to analysis \u2013 is challenged through peer review and tested through replication. \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Fluoridation is effective, safe and benefits everyone regardless of age or income. About 3 out of 4 people in U.S. communities enjoy fluoridated water. So, until recently, questions about fluoride and IQ were rare.\nStudies conducted in New Zealand and Sweden showed that the IQ scores of adolescents and adults living in fluoridated communities during infancy and childhood were no different than the scores of people who lived in unfluoridated communities. These two studies are uniquely robust because they tracked IQ and other possible effects in large numbers of participants over a long period of time, well into adulthood.\nOpponents of fluoridation began focusing on IQ after the 2012 publication of a systematic review of 27 studies from around the world. Opponents claimed that this review showed that lower IQ scores in children were \u201ccaused\u201d by fluoride. There are many reasons why the evidence does not support this claim.\nIn recent years, opponents have focused on prenatal exposure to fluoride, with studies from Mexico City and Canada, where fluoride exposure is similar to U.S. and Canadian communities. These studies reported some differences in the IQ scores of 3 and 4 year olds related to the level of fluoride their mothers were exposed to. However, the Canadian study showed a significant difference only for boys \u2014 and only on one of the two tests.\nMany issues have been raised about the quality of the studies from Mexico City and Canada and, importantly, the results have not been confirmed by other research teams.\nThe Canadian studies are based on a single data set that was not designed to measure a mother\u2019s exposure to fluoride and how it might affect the IQ of offspring. This recently published analysis cites authoritative sources that dismiss the validity of both the measure of the individual mothers\u2019 exposures to fluoride and how the IQ of their children were tested.\nAny study of IQ differences must take into account the many factors that affect intelligence scores. Some of these include breastfeeding, nutrition, and mothers\u2019 IQ. Researchers work to account for these factors to increase confidence that a study\u2019s results are not skewed or otherwise affected.\nThe studies from Mexico City and Canada accounted for some but not all these factors. They relied on IQ testing that was conducted at only one age. By contrast, the New Zealand study tested IQ several times, starting at age 7 and ending at age 38. The fact that multiple test scores were collected, and over 31 year a period time, means that we can have more confidence in these results over others.\nIn 2015, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) initiated a review of studies on fluoride and possible effects on neurodevelopment. Before its publication in 2024, the NTP sought peer-review of its work, choosing the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. After performing two reviews, the National Academies concluded that the NTP had not identified \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence to support its initial claim that fluoride causes low IQ. As a result, the NTP had to remove its classification of fluoride as a \u201chazard\u201d.\nGoing one step further, the National Academies instructed the NTP to state very clearly that the studies it reviewed did not adequately examine exposure to low levels of fluoride, \u201cincluding those typically associated with drinking-water fluoridation.\u201d Although NTP\u2019s report found an association between high fluoride concentrations and lower IQ in children where fluoride levels exceeded WHO guidelines (1.5 mg/L), that is more than twice the 0.7 mg/L level of fluoridation in the U.S. and Canada.\nThe authors of the NTP report also publish a meta-analysis within which they acknowledged that three low-risk-of-bias studies on fluoride levels under 1.5 mg/L showed no association of fluoride with children\u2019s IQ. These findings are consistent with a meta-analysis conducted by other researchers who examined eight studies conducted in areas with water fluoridation comparable to the U.S., below 1.5 mg/L. They, too, found no association between fluoride exposure and IQ.\nNonetheless, publication of the meta-analysis spurred immediate criticism. Defects serious enough to call for retraction of the meta-analysis were enumerated in another such critique which concluded, \u201cWe further find major problems with the sources employed, including reliance on studies from non-MEDLINE indexed publications with an anti-fluoridation editorial stance, and major underlying issues with the data reported in several instances, indicative of impossible or unreliable data. Taylor et al is not reliable nor are its errors remediable. It should be retracted to avoid harms to public health and scientific discourse.\u201d\nIn 2021, a study from Spain agreed with the 2019 Canadian study that mothers\u2019 prenatal fluoride exposure was not associated with any difference in girls\u2019 IQ. However, it had an opposite finding regarding boys, finding higher cognitive scores in boys at age 4, not lower. A much larger 2022 study in Australia followed boys and girls with different lifetime fluoride exposures from birth to age 5. This study assessed the children\u2019s emotional and behavioral development later, before they reached age 18. Their conclusion?

The recent article in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Pediatrics \u201cFluoride Exposure and Children\u2019s IQ Scores: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis\u201d consists of the metanalysis left out of the National Toxicology Program\u2019s (NTP) monograph released in August and does not provide any new evidence to warrant changing current community water fluoridation practices.\nAn accompanying commentary, \u201cCaution Needed in Interpreting the Evidence Base on Fluoride and IQ,\u201d by University of Iowa dental professor and international expert on fluoride intake, Steven Levy, D.D.S., M.P.H., cautions that the systematic review and meta-analysis, which contend fluoride exposure can lower children\u2019s IQ levels, are deeply flawed. \u201cWhile I have serious concerns about biases and other methodological flaws in this meta-analysis, the main takeaway is that it did not find any connection between lower IQ and fluoride intake at the level recommended for community water fluoridation,\u201d Dr. Levy\u2019s commentary explains. Dr. Levy is also a member of the ADA\u2019s National Fluoridation Advisory Committee.\n\u201cThe public needs to understand that the levels examined in NTP report are from countries with high levels of naturally occurring fluoride that is more than double the amount recommended by the U.S. Public Health Service to optimally fluoridate community water systems and help prevent dental disease,\u201d said Brett Kessler, D.D.S., president of the American Dental Association. \u201cA more recent study in which the level of fluoride in water is comparable to that in the U.S. found no measurable effect on cognitive neurodevelopment or IQ scores in children. To prevent dental disease the ADA continues to recommend drinking optimally fluoridated water along with twice daily brushing with fluoride toothpaste and eating a healthy diet, low in added sugars,\u201d said Dr. Kessler.\nThe ADA\u2019s National Fluoridation Advisory Committee and other experts concluded the final National Toxicology Program did not adequately address or overcome biases and weaknesses of the studies reviewed as identified from initial NTP draft reports. The report twice failed peer review by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM), required additional scientific review by an NTP Board of Scientific Counselors (BSC), and underwent a significant number of revisions and edits before it was finally released earlier this year.\nThe final NTP report was also considered in a recent District Court case, and the key takeaway from the District Court ruling is that the final NTP report \u201cdoes not conclude with any certainty that fluoridated water is injurious to public health,\u201d as stated by District Court Judge Edward Chen.\n\u201cAs a science-based organization with health care professionals dedicated to improving the oral and overall health of the public, the ADA welcomes future U.S.-based research and data relevant to this country\u2019s practice of fluoridating water,\u201d Dr. Kessler states. \u201cThe ADA has yet to see any peer-reviewed published research that would alter its long-standing position that optimally fluoridated water is beneficial and safe for the oral health of the public.\u201d\nFor more information on community water fluoridation and ADA advocacy, visit ADA.org/fluoride.\nAbout the American Dental Association The not-for-profit ADA is the nation's largest dental association, representing 154,000 dentist members.

These meta-analyses show that fluoride exposure relevant to community water fluoridation is not associated with lower IQ scores in children.\n\nFull Page Content:\nAmerica has been preventing tooth decay with fluoridated water for over 80 years. Fluoridation is effective, safe and benefits everyone regardless of age or income. About 3 out of 4 people in U.S. communities enjoy fluoridated water. So, until recently, questions about fluoride and IQ were rare.\nStudies conducted in New Zealand and Sweden showed that the IQ scores of adolescents and adults living in fluoridated communities during infancy and childhood were no different than the scores of people who lived in unfluoridated communities. These two studies are uniquely robust because they tracked IQ and other possible effects in large numbers of participants over a long period of time, well into adulthood.\nOpponents of fluoridation began focusing on IQ after the 2012 publication of a systematic review of 27 studies from around the world. Opponents claimed that this review showed that lower IQ scores in children were \u201ccaused\u201d by fluoride. There are many reasons why the evidence does not support this claim.\nIn recent years, opponents have focused on prenatal exposure to fluoride, with studies from Mexico City and Canada, where fluoride exposure is similar to U.S. and Canadian communities. These studies reported some differences in the IQ scores of 3 and 4 year olds related to the level of fluoride their mothers were exposed to. However, the Canadian study showed a significant difference only for boys \u2014 and only on one of the two tests.\nMany issues have been raised about the quality of the studies from Mexico City and Canada and, importantly, the results have not been confirmed by other research teams.\nThe Canadian studies are based on a single data set that was not designed to measure a mother\u2019s exposure to fluoride and how it might affect the IQ of offspring. This recently published analysis cites authoritative sources that dismiss the validity of both the measure of the individual mothers\u2019 exposures to fluoride and how the IQ of their children were tested.\nAny study of IQ differences must take into account the many factors that affect intelligence scores. Some of these include breastfeeding, nutrition, and mothers\u2019 IQ. Researchers work to account for these factors to increase confidence that a study\u2019s results are not skewed or otherwise affected.\nThe studies from Mexico City and Canada accounted for some but not all these factors. They relied on IQ testing that was conducted at only one age. By contrast, the New Zealand study tested IQ several times, starting at age 7 and ending at age 38. The fact that multiple test scores were collected, and over 31 year a period time, means that we can have more confidence in these results over others.\nIn 2015, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) initiated a review of studies on fluoride and possible effects on neurodevelopment. Before its publication in 2024, the NTP sought peer-review of its work, choosing the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. After performing two reviews, the National Academies concluded that the NTP had not identified \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence to support its initial claim that fluoride causes low IQ. As a result, the NTP had to remove its classification of fluoride as a \u201chazard\u201d.\nGoing one step further, the National Academies instructed the NTP to state very clearly that the studies it reviewed did not adequately examine exposure to low levels of fluoride, \u201cincluding those typically associated with drinking-water fluoridation.\u201d Although NTP\u2019s report found an association between high fluoride concentrations and lower IQ in children where fluoride levels exceeded WHO guidelines (1.5 mg/L), that is more than twice the 0.7 mg/L level of fluoridation in the U.S. and Canada.\nThe authors of the NTP report also publish a meta-analysis within which they acknowledged that three low-risk-of-bias studies on fluoride levels under 1.5 mg/L showed no association of fluoride with children\u2019s IQ. These findings are consistent with a meta-analysis conducted by other researchers who examined eight studies conducted in areas with water fluoridation comparable to the U.S., below 1.5 mg/L. They, too, found no association between fluoride exposure and IQ.\nNonetheless, publication of the meta-analysis spurred immediate criticism. Defects serious enough to call for retraction of the meta-analysis were enumerated in another such critique which concluded, \u201cWe further find major problems with the sources employed, including reliance on studies from non-MEDLINE indexed publications with an anti-fluoridation editorial stance, and major underlying issues with the data reported in several instances, indicative of impossible or unreliable data. Taylor et al is not reliable nor are its errors remediable. It should be retracted to avoid harms to public health and scientific discourse.\u201d\nIn 2021, a study from Spain agreed with the 2019 Canadian study that mothers\u2019 prenatal fluoride exposure was not associated with any difference in girls\u2019 IQ. However, it had an opposite finding regarding boys, finding higher cognitive scores in boys at age 4, not lower. A much larger 2022 study in Australia followed boys and girls with different lifetime fluoride exposures from birth to age 5. This study assessed the children\u2019s emotional and behavioral development later, before they reached age 18. Their conclusion? Exposure to fluoridated water during the first five years of life was not associated with altered measures of child emotional and behavioral development and executive functioning.\nMore than 7,000 studies and research papers have been conducted on fluoridation, and the overwhelming evidence demonstrates its safety and benefits. This enormous body of research and over 80 years of public health practice consistently point to the effectiveness and safety of fluoride use in the U.S.\nScience looks for patterns. The public is well-served when research \u2013 from process to data to analysis \u2013 is challenged through peer review and tested through replication. \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Our analysis was limited to cases less than 20 years old. We standardized fluoride exposure estimates based on CDC-recommended target levels that take climate into account. We categorized exposure into three groups (<30%, 30-99%, >99% of target) and used conditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios.\nResults: Analysis is based on 103 cases under the age of 20 and 215 matched controls. For males, the unadjusted odds ratios for higher exposures were greater than 1.0 at each exposure age, reaching a peak of 4.07 (95% CI 1.43, 11.56) at age 7 years for the highest exposure. Adjusting for potential confounders produced similar results with an adjusted odds ratio for males of 5.46 (95% CI 1.50, 19.90) at age 7 years. This association was not apparent among females.\nConclusions: Our exploratory analysis found an association between fluoride exposure in drinking water during childhood and the incidence of osteosarcoma among males but not consistently among females.

The recent article in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Pediatrics \u201cFluoride Exposure and Children\u2019s IQ Scores: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis\u201d consists of the metanalysis left out of the National Toxicology Program\u2019s (NTP) monograph released in August and does not provide any new evidence to warrant changing current community water fluoridation practices.\nAn accompanying commentary, \u201cCaution Needed in Interpreting the Evidence Base on Fluoride and IQ,\u201d by University of Iowa dental professor and international expert on fluoride intake, Steven Levy, D.D.S., M.P.H., cautions that the systematic review and meta-analysis, which contend fluoride exposure can lower children\u2019s IQ levels, are deeply flawed. \u201cWhile I have serious concerns about biases and other methodological flaws in this meta-analysis, the main takeaway is that it did not find any connection between lower IQ and fluoride intake at the level recommended for community water fluoridation,\u201d Dr. Levy\u2019s commentary explains. Dr. Levy is also a member of the ADA\u2019s National Fluoridation Advisory Committee.\n\u201cThe public needs to understand that the levels examined in NTP report are from countries with high levels of naturally occurring fluoride that is more than double the amount recommended by the U.S. Public Health Service to optimally fluoridate community water systems and help prevent dental disease,\u201d said Brett Kessler, D.D.S., president of the American Dental Association. \u201cA more recent study in which the level of fluoride in water is comparable to that in the U.S. found no measurable effect on cognitive neurodevelopment or IQ scores in children. To prevent dental disease the ADA continues to recommend drinking optimally fluoridated water along with twice daily brushing with fluoride toothpaste and eating a healthy diet, low in added sugars,\u201d said Dr. Kessler.\nThe ADA\u2019s National Fluoridation Advisory Committee and other experts concluded the final National Toxicology Program did not adequately address or overcome biases and weaknesses of the studies reviewed as identified from initial NTP draft reports. The report twice failed peer review by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM), required additional scientific review by an NTP Board of Scientific Counselors (BSC), and underwent a significant number of revisions and edits before it was finally released earlier this year.\nThe final NTP report was also considered in a recent District Court case, and the key takeaway from the District Court ruling is that the final NTP report \u201cdoes not conclude with any certainty that fluoridated water is injurious to public health,\u201d as stated by District Court Judge Edward Chen.\n\u201cAs a science-based organization with health care professionals dedicated to improving the oral and overall health of the public, the ADA welcomes future U.S.-based research and data relevant to this country\u2019s practice of fluoridating water,\u201d Dr. Kessler states. \u201cThe ADA has yet to see any peer-reviewed published research that would alter its long-standing position that optimally fluoridated water is beneficial and safe for the oral health of the public.\u201d\nFor more information on community water fluoridation and ADA advocacy, visit ADA.org/fluoride.\nAbout the American Dental Association The not-for-profit ADA is the nation's largest dental association, representing 154,000 dentist members.

Safety of fluoridated water ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nHarvard University said it is investigating whether a dentistry professor who edits a newsletter funded by a toothpaste maker played down research showing an increased cancer risk from drinking fluoridated tap water.\nThe school will work with the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences to review Chester Douglass\u2019 research into fluoride exposure and osteosarcoma, a rare form of bone cancer, Harvard Medical School spokesman John Lacey said.\nThe institute awarded a $1.3 million study grant in 1992 to Douglass, who found that the odds of having osteosarcoma after drinking fluoridated water were \u201cnot statistically different\u201d from the odds for those who drank non-fluoridated water.\nElise Bassin, a doctoral student supervised by Douglass who studied some of the same people, reported in her 2001 thesis that boys who drink fluoridated water appear to have an increased risk of developing the bone cancer.\nThe Environmental Working Group, an advocacy group based in Washington, D.C., filed an ethics complaint against Douglass last month after discovering that he cited Bassin\u2019s research in his final grant report. In it, he said her work supported his claim that there was no significant risk from fluoridated water, even though Bassin had found a strong link between fluoride levels in tap water and an increased osteosarcoma risk for boys.\nRichard Wiles, senior vice president of the environmental group, also said there is a conflict of interest between Douglass\u2019 research and his position as editor in chief of the Colgate Oral Health Report, a quarterly newsletter funded by Colgate-Palmolive Co., which makes fluoridated toothpaste.\n\u201cIt\u2019s safe to say that he appears to be one of the leading members of the fluoride apologists group of scientists,\u201d Wiles said. \u201cClearly, the fluoride-using industry, the dental industry, has an interest in the image of fluoride as being a healthy, good thing.\u201d\nA woman who answered the phone on Wednesday at Douglass\u2019 office said he was on vacation and unavailable for comment.\nCommittee to review allegations In a statement Wednesday, the Harvard School of Dental Medicine said it was following standard practice in allegations of research impropriety and will assemble a committee to review them.\nChristine Bruske, a spokeswoman for NIEHS, said the institute is reviewing the letter it received from the Environmental Working Group alleging \u201cscientific misconduct\u201d by Douglass, who heads Harvard\u2019s Department of Oral Health Policy and Epidemiology.\nBassin declined to comment. Her thesis has not yet been published and is not available to the public, but the environmental group obtained it and cited excerpts in a letter sent to Douglass last month.\n\u201cAmong males, exposure to fluoride at or above the target level was associated with an increased risk of developing osteosarcoma,\u201d Bassin wrote. \u201cThe association was most apparent between ages 5-10 with a peak at 6 to 8 years of age.\u201d\nDouglass\u2019 study looked at men and women of all different ages who drank fluoridated tap water. Bassin looked at the boys and girls used in Douglass\u2019 study and verified fluoride levels in tap water for each year of the child\u2019s life.\n\u201cShe found the strongest association ever between fluoridated tap water and bone cancer among boys,\u201d Wiles said.\nSafety of fluoridated water questioned Fluoridation of tap water in the United States began in the 1950s and was seen as an effective way to fight tooth decay.\nControversy over the practice began to grow in the 1970s after a study found a high incident in bone structure defects in Newburgh, N.Y., one of the first communities in the country to fluoridate its water, when compared with the rate in the non-fluoridated town of Kingston, N.Y.\nA study completed in 1991 by the U.S. Public Health Service found that rates of osteosarcoma were significantly higher among males under 20 who lived in communities with fluoridated water than in those without it.\nOther major studies have reached the opposite conclusion, including a 1995 study by the New York State Health Department that found fluoride exposure does not increase the risk for childhood osteosarcoma.\nWiles said the Environmental Working Group does not oppose fluoridated toothpaste because most fluoride in toothpaste is not ingested. He said when fluoride is ingested through tap water, it can stimulate growth at the end of bones, where osteosarcoma occurs.\n\u201cI think the industry realizes that the public may not make the distinction,\u201d Wiles said. If fluoride gets a big black eye in tap water then the public is going to wonder about this fluoride in my toothpaste.\u201d\n\u00a9 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Further, the EPA ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nPosted November 25, 2013 & filed under What the Experts Say about Fluoride.\nIn October 2012, Environmental Health Perspectives published an article entitled \u201cDevelopmental Fluoride Neurotoxicity: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis\u201d that noted \u201cthe possibility of an adverse effect of high fluoride exposure on children\u2019s neurodevelopment.\u201d Anti-fluoride groups often cite this finding out of context. Here are four important observations that the Campaign for Dental Health research team has made after reviewing the study, often referred to as \u201cthe Harvard study\u201d because the first of four authors is with the Harvard School of Public Health.\n1. Harvard did not conduct primary research or data collection on this topic. This study is a systematic review and meta-analysis of 27 previously published studies. The quality of the studies under review varied widely, causing the authors to state that \u201ceach of the articles reviewed had deficiencies, in some cases rather serious, which limit the conclusions that can be drawn.\u201d\n2. The study reviewed data on IQ test scores for children living in areas of China, Mongolia, and Iran where fluoride levels were significantly higher than those of fluoridated public water systems in the United States. The highest levels observed in any of the studies \u2013 up to 11.5 mg/L \u2013 are more than 10 times higher than the optimal level used in the U.S.\n3. The study found a very small difference in IQ test scores between children in the high-fluoride and low-fluoride areas. In addition, the authors acknowledge that the average difference \u201cmay be within the measurement error of IQ testing.\u201d\n4. The authors call for future research to include more precise data on the children involved and greater confidence that other factors have been ruled out as contributing to differences in IQ test scores. The authors noted, for example, that \u201creports of lead concentrations in the study villages in China were not available.\u201d\nThis article describes a complex analysis of heterogeneous studies published over 22 years in several different countries, the result of which is a cautious association between high levels of fluoride exposure and possible reductions in IQ test scores. It is not a conclusive study nor can it be represented as definitive evidence of a link between fluoride and lower IQs in children.

Loc Do, Ph.D., co-author of the study, said factors that could impact the relationship between fluoride and IQ, such as socioeconomic status, were taken into account when determining the results.\nHe added that while there are claims water fluoridation can negatively affect children\u2019s neurodevelopment, \u201cthese results provide consistent evidence this is not the case.\u201d\n\u201cThis population-based follow-up study has provided consistent scientific evidence that early-life exposure to fluoride was not negatively associated with cognitive neurodevelopment. The findings, in combination with the current body of knowledge, provide assurance that the currently practiced [water fluoridation] programs are both effective and safe for young children,\u201d the study concludes.\nIn Australia, 89% of the population served by community water systems benefit from water fluoridated at 0.6- 1.1 mg/L. Research from studies such as the National Child Oral Health Study and Environmental Research\u2019s systematic review of water fluoridation in Australia have shown that fluoride decrease the rate of tooth decay by 26-44% in adults and children.\nThis new research is currently being reviewed by the National Fluoridation Advisory Committee, the ADA\u2019s standing panel of experts that provide advice about the safety and effectiveness of fluoride.\nThe ADA has continually advocated for community water fluoridation, highlighting the mineral\u2019s proven effectiveness in preventing tooth decay. For more than 75 years strong scientific evidence has consistently shown that fluoride is safe and beneficial, according to the ADA.\nJayanth Kumar, D.D.S., former California state dental director and National Fluoridation Advisory Committee member, said the follow-up study provided additional scientific evidence that early-life exposure to fluoride is not negatively associated with brain development.\n\u201cThe findings add to the growing body of evidence from more than a dozen studies showing that fluoride concentration relevant to community water fluoridation is safe,\u201d he said.\nFor more information on community water fluoridation, visit ADA.org/fluoride.\nGame Changer: AI-Driven Matchmaking for Practice Transitions\nElevate your career, your life and your momentum with resources and benefits from the nation\u2019s leading dental association\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The report didn' ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAmerica has been preventing tooth decay with fluoridated water for over 80 years. Fluoridation is effective, safe and benefits everyone regardless of age or income. About 3 out of 4 people in U.S. communities enjoy fluoridated water. So, until recently, questions about fluoride and IQ were rare.\nStudies conducted in New Zealand and Sweden showed that the IQ scores of adolescents and adults living in fluoridated communities during infancy and childhood were no different than the scores of people who lived in unfluoridated communities. These two studies are uniquely robust because they tracked IQ and other possible effects in large numbers of participants over a long period of time, well into adulthood.\nOpponents of fluoridation began focusing on IQ after the 2012 publication of a systematic review of 27 studies from around the world. Opponents claimed that this review showed that lower IQ scores in children were \u201ccaused\u201d by fluoride. There are many reasons why the evidence does not support this claim.\nIn recent years, opponents have focused on prenatal exposure to fluoride, with studies from Mexico City and Canada, where fluoride exposure is similar to U.S. and Canadian communities. These studies reported some differences in the IQ scores of 3 and 4 year olds related to the level of fluoride their mothers were exposed to. However, the Canadian study showed a significant difference only for boys \u2014 and only on one of the two tests.\nMany issues have been raised about the quality of the studies from Mexico City and Canada and, importantly, the results have not been confirmed by other research teams.\nThe Canadian studies are based on a single data set that was not designed to measure a mother\u2019s exposure to fluoride and how it might affect the IQ of offspring. This recently published analysis cites authoritative sources that dismiss the validity of both the measure of the individual mothers\u2019 exposures to fluoride and how the IQ of their children were tested.\nAny study of IQ differences must take into account the many factors that affect intelligence scores. Some of these include breastfeeding, nutrition, and mothers\u2019 IQ. Researchers work to account for these factors to increase confidence that a study\u2019s results are not skewed or otherwise affected.\nThe studies from Mexico City and Canada accounted for some but not all these factors. They relied on IQ testing that was conducted at only one age. By contrast, the New Zealand study tested IQ several times, starting at age 7 and ending at age 38. The fact that multiple test scores were collected, and over 31 year a period time, means that we can have more confidence in these results over others.\nIn 2015, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) initiated a review of studies on fluoride and possible effects on neurodevelopment. Before its publication in 2024, the NTP sought peer-review of its work, choosing the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. After performing two reviews, the National Academies concluded that the NTP had not identified \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence to support its initial claim that fluoride causes low IQ. As a result, the NTP had to remove its classification of fluoride as a \u201chazard\u201d.\nGoing one step further, the National Academies instructed the NTP to state very clearly that the studies it reviewed did not adequately examine exposure to low levels of fluoride, \u201cincluding those typically associated with drinking-water fluoridation.\u201d Although NTP\u2019s report found an association between high fluoride concentrations and lower IQ in children where fluoride levels exceeded WHO guidelines (1.5 mg/L), that is more than twice the 0.7 mg/L level of fluoridation in the U.S. and Canada.\nThe authors of the NTP report also publish a meta-analysis within which they acknowledged that three low-risk-of-bias studies on fluoride levels under 1.5 mg/L showed no association of fluoride with children\u2019s IQ. These findings are consistent with a meta-analysis conducted by other researchers who examined eight studies conducted in areas with water fluoridation comparable to the U.S., below 1.5 mg/L. They, too, found no association between fluoride exposure and IQ.\nNonetheless, publication of the meta-analysis spurred immediate criticism. Defects serious enough to call for retraction of the meta-analysis were enumerated in another such critique which concluded, \u201cWe further find major problems with the sources employed, including reliance on studies from non-MEDLINE indexed publications with an anti-fluoridation editorial stance, and major underlying issues with the data reported in several instances, indicative of impossible or unreliable data. Taylor et al is not reliable nor are its errors remediable. It should be retracted to avoid harms to public health and scientific discourse.\u201d\nIn 2021, a study from Spain agreed with the 2019 Canadian study that mothers\u2019 prenatal fluoride exposure was not associated with any difference in girls\u2019 IQ. However, it had an opposite finding regarding boys, finding higher cognitive scores in boys at age 4, not lower. A much larger 2022 study in Australia followed boys and girls with different lifetime fluoride exposures from birth to age 5. This study assessed the children\u2019s emotional and behavioral development later, before they reached age 18. Their conclusion? Exposure to fluoridated water during the first five years of life was not associated with altered measures of child emotional and behavioral development and executive functioning.\nMore than 7,000 studies and research papers have been conducted on fluoridation, and the overwhelming evidence demonstrates its safety and benefits. This enormous body of research and over 80 years of public health practice consistently point to the effectiveness and safety of fluoride use in the U.S.\nScience looks for patterns. The public is well-served when research \u2013 from process to data to analysis \u2013 is challenged through peer review and tested through replication. \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

While researchers considered the evidence to be equivocal, Dr. Hayes said, they did find a slightly higher incidence of bone cancer in those particular rats.\nAn exploratory analysis from 2006 found an increased risk for osteosarcoma in boys aged 7 exposed to fluoridated drinking water, but not consistently for girls, the ADA said. This prompted a case control study co-authored by Dr. Hayes that analyzed fluoride levels in bone samples from 137 human patients with primary osteosarcoma and bone samples from 51 patients with other malignant bone tumors who served as the control group.\n\u201cWhat was found is that there was no difference in bone fluoride concentrations in the people who had the osteosarcoma versus those who did not. And that was pretty significant because no one had really ever done that before,\u201d Dr. Hayes said.\nShe noted that researchers examined patients\u2019 residential histories and fluoride supplements. They conducted an analysis on individuals who lived in fluoridated communities versus those who did not, and found there was no difference in osteosarcoma risk. Dr. Hayes also added that osteosarcoma is already a very rare form of cancer.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence whatsoever to suggest that fluoridated water causes osteosarcoma.

Harvard did not conduct primary research or data collection on this topic. This study is a systematic review and meta-analysis of 27 previously published studies. The quality of the studies under review varied widely, causing the authors to state that \u201ceach of the articles reviewed had deficiencies, in some cases rather serious, which limit the conclusions that can be drawn.\u201d\n2. The study reviewed data on IQ test scores for children living in areas of China, Mongolia, and Iran where fluoride levels were significantly higher than those of fluoridated public water systems in the United States. The highest levels observed in any of the studies \u2013 up to 11.5 mg/L \u2013 are more than 10 times higher than the optimal level used in the U.S.\n3. The study found a very small difference in IQ test scores between children in the high-fluoride and low-fluoride areas. In addition, the authors acknowledge that the average difference \u201cmay be within the measurement error of IQ testing.\u201d\n4. The authors call for future research to include more precise data on the children involved and greater confidence that other factors have been ruled out as contributing to differences in IQ test scores. The authors noted, for example, that \u201creports of lead concentrations in the study villages in China were not available.\u201d\nThis article describes a complex analysis of heterogeneous studies published over 22 years in several different countries, the result of which is a cautious association between high levels of fluoride exposure and possible reductions in IQ test scores. It is not a conclusive study nor can it be represented as definitive evidence of a link between fluoride and lower IQs in children.

The recent article in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Pediatrics \u201cFluoride Exposure and Children\u2019s IQ Scores: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis\u201d consists of the metanalysis left out of the National Toxicology Program\u2019s (NTP) monograph released in August and does not provide any new evidence to warrant changing current community water fluoridation practices.\nAn accompanying commentary, \u201cCaution Needed in Interpreting the Evidence Base on Fluoride and IQ,\u201d by University of Iowa dental professor and international expert on fluoride intake, Steven Levy, D.D.S., M.P.H., cautions that the systematic review and meta-analysis, which contend fluoride exposure can lower children\u2019s IQ levels, are deeply flawed. \u201cWhile I have serious concerns about biases and other methodological flaws in this meta-analysis, the main takeaway is that it did not find any connection between lower IQ and fluoride intake at the level recommended for community water fluoridation,\u201d Dr. Levy\u2019s commentary explains. Dr. Levy is also a member of the ADA\u2019s National Fluoridation Advisory Committee.\n\u201cThe public needs to understand that the levels examined in NTP report are from countries with high levels of naturally occurring fluoride that is more than double the amount recommended by the U.S. Public Health Service to optimally fluoridate community water systems and help prevent dental disease,\u201d said Brett Kessler, D.D.S., president of the American Dental Association. \u201cA more recent study in which the level of fluoride in water is comparable to that in the U.S. found no measurable effect on cognitive neurodevelopment or IQ scores in children. To prevent dental disease the ADA continues to recommend drinking optimally fluoridated water along with twice daily brushing with fluoride toothpaste and eating a healthy diet, low in added sugars,\u201d said Dr. Kessler.\nThe ADA\u2019s National Fluoridation Advisory Committee and other experts concluded the final National Toxicology Program did not adequately address or overcome biases and weaknesses of the studies reviewed as identified from initial NTP draft reports. The report twice failed peer review by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM), required additional scientific review by an NTP Board of Scientific Counselors (BSC), and underwent a significant number of revisions and edits before it was finally released earlier this year.\nThe final NTP report was also considered in a recent District Court case, and the key takeaway from the District Court ruling is that the final NTP report \u201cdoes not conclude with any certainty that fluoridated water is injurious to public health,\u201d as stated by District Court Judge Edward Chen.\n\u201cAs a science-based organization with health care professionals dedicated to improving the oral and overall health of the public, the ADA welcomes future U.S.-based research and data relevant to this country\u2019s practice of fluoridating water,\u201d Dr. Kessler states. \u201cThe ADA has yet to see any peer-reviewed published research that would alter its long-standing position that optimally fluoridated water is beneficial and safe for the oral health of the public.\u201d\nFor more information on community water fluoridation and ADA advocacy, visit ADA.org/fluoride.\nAbout the American Dental Association The not-for-profit ADA is the nation's largest dental association, representing 154,000 dentist members.

Many substances are healthy and beneficial when taken ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAmerica has been preventing tooth decay with fluoridated water for over 80 years. Fluoridation is effective, safe and benefits everyone regardless of age or income. About 3 out of 4 people in U.S. communities enjoy fluoridated water. So, until recently, questions about fluoride and IQ were rare.\nStudies conducted in New Zealand and Sweden showed that the IQ scores of adolescents and adults living in fluoridated communities during infancy and childhood were no different than the scores of people who lived in unfluoridated communities. These two studies are uniquely robust because they tracked IQ and other possible effects in large numbers of participants over a long period of time, well into adulthood.\nOpponents of fluoridation began focusing on IQ after the 2012 publication of a systematic review of 27 studies from around the world. Opponents claimed that this review showed that lower IQ scores in children were \u201ccaused\u201d by fluoride. There are many reasons why the evidence does not support this claim.\nIn recent years, opponents have focused on prenatal exposure to fluoride, with studies from Mexico City and Canada, where fluoride exposure is similar to U.S. and Canadian communities. These studies reported some differences in the IQ scores of 3 and 4 year olds related to the level of fluoride their mothers were exposed to. However, the Canadian study showed a significant difference only for boys \u2014 and only on one of the two tests.\nMany issues have been raised about the quality of the studies from Mexico City and Canada and, importantly, the results have not been confirmed by other research teams.\nThe Canadian studies are based on a single data set that was not designed to measure a mother\u2019s exposure to fluoride and how it might affect the IQ of offspring. This recently published analysis cites authoritative sources that dismiss the validity of both the measure of the individual mothers\u2019 exposures to fluoride and how the IQ of their children were tested.\nAny study of IQ differences must take into account the many factors that affect intelligence scores. Some of these include breastfeeding, nutrition, and mothers\u2019 IQ. Researchers work to account for these factors to increase confidence that a study\u2019s results are not skewed or otherwise affected.\nThe studies from Mexico City and Canada accounted for some but not all these factors. They relied on IQ testing that was conducted at only one age. By contrast, the New Zealand study tested IQ several times, starting at age 7 and ending at age 38. The fact that multiple test scores were collected, and over 31 year a period time, means that we can have more confidence in these results over others.\nIn 2015, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) initiated a review of studies on fluoride and possible effects on neurodevelopment. Before its publication in 2024, the NTP sought peer-review of its work, choosing the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. After performing two reviews, the National Academies concluded that the NTP had not identified \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence to support its initial claim that fluoride causes low IQ. As a result, the NTP had to remove its classification of fluoride as a \u201chazard\u201d.\nGoing one step further, the National Academies instructed the NTP to state very clearly that the studies it reviewed did not adequately examine exposure to low levels of fluoride, \u201cincluding those typically associated with drinking-water fluoridation.\u201d Although NTP\u2019s report found an association between high fluoride concentrations and lower IQ in children where fluoride levels exceeded WHO guidelines (1.5 mg/L), that is more than twice the 0.7 mg/L level of fluoridation in the U.S. and Canada.\nThe authors of the NTP report also publish a meta-analysis within which they acknowledged that three low-risk-of-bias studies on fluoride levels under 1.5 mg/L showed no association of fluoride with children\u2019s IQ. These findings are consistent with a meta-analysis conducted by other researchers who examined eight studies conducted in areas with water fluoridation comparable to the U.S., below 1.5 mg/L. They, too, found no association between fluoride exposure and IQ.\nNonetheless, publication of the meta-analysis spurred immediate criticism. Defects serious enough to call for retraction of the meta-analysis were enumerated in another such critique which concluded, \u201cWe further find major problems with the sources employed, including reliance on studies from non-MEDLINE indexed publications with an anti-fluoridation editorial stance, and major underlying issues with the data reported in several instances, indicative of impossible or unreliable data. Taylor et al is not reliable nor are its errors remediable. It should be retracted to avoid harms to public health and scientific discourse.\u201d\nIn 2021, a study from Spain agreed with the 2019 Canadian study that mothers\u2019 prenatal fluoride exposure was not associated with any difference in girls\u2019 IQ. However, it had an opposite finding regarding boys, finding higher cognitive scores in boys at age 4, not lower. A much larger 2022 study in Australia followed boys and girls with different lifetime fluoride exposures from birth to age 5. This study assessed the children\u2019s emotional and behavioral development later, before they reached age 18. Their conclusion? Exposure to fluoridated water during the first five years of life was not associated with altered measures of child emotional and behavioral development and executive functioning.\nMore than 7,000 studies and research papers have been conducted on fluoridation, and the overwhelming evidence demonstrates its safety and benefits. This enormous body of research and over 80 years of public health practice consistently point to the effectiveness and safety of fluoride use in the U.S.\nScience looks for patterns. The public is well-served when research \u2013 from process to data to analysis \u2013 is challenged through peer review and tested through replication. \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The recent article in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Pediatrics \u201cFluoride Exposure and Children\u2019s IQ Scores: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis\u201d consists of the metanalysis left out of the National Toxicology Program\u2019s (NTP) monograph released in August and does not provide any new evidence to warrant changing current community water fluoridation practices.\nAn accompanying commentary, \u201cCaution Needed in Interpreting the Evidence Base on Fluoride and IQ,\u201d by University of Iowa dental professor and international expert on fluoride intake, Steven Levy, D.D.S., M.P.H., cautions that the systematic review and meta-analysis, which contend fluoride exposure can lower children\u2019s IQ levels, are deeply flawed. \u201cWhile I have serious concerns about biases and other methodological flaws in this meta-analysis, the main takeaway is that it did not find any connection between lower IQ and fluoride intake at the level recommended for community water fluoridation,\u201d Dr. Levy\u2019s commentary explains. Dr. Levy is also a member of the ADA\u2019s National Fluoridation Advisory Committee.\n\u201cThe public needs to understand that the levels examined in NTP report are from countries with high levels of naturally occurring fluoride that is more than double the amount recommended by the U.S. Public Health Service to optimally fluoridate community water systems and help prevent dental disease,\u201d said Brett Kessler, D.D.S., president of the American Dental Association. \u201cA more recent study in which the level of fluoride in water is comparable to that in the U.S. found no measurable effect on cognitive neurodevelopment or IQ scores in children. To prevent dental disease the ADA continues to recommend drinking optimally fluoridated water along with twice daily brushing with fluoride toothpaste and eating a healthy diet, low in added sugars,\u201d said Dr. Kessler.\nThe ADA\u2019s National Fluoridation Advisory Committee and other experts concluded the final National Toxicology Program did not adequately address or overcome biases and weaknesses of the studies reviewed as identified from initial NTP draft reports. The report twice failed peer review by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM), required additional scientific review by an NTP Board of Scientific Counselors (BSC), and underwent a significant number of revisions and edits before it was finally released earlier this year.\nThe final NTP report was also considered in a recent District Court case, and the key takeaway from the District Court ruling is that the final NTP report \u201cdoes not conclude with any certainty that fluoridated water is injurious to public health,\u201d as stated by District Court Judge Edward Chen.\n\u201cAs a science-based organization with health care professionals dedicated to improving the oral and overall health of the public, the ADA welcomes future U.S.-based research and data relevant to this country\u2019s practice of fluoridating water,\u201d Dr. Kessler states. \u201cThe ADA has yet to see any peer-reviewed published research that would alter its long-standing position that optimally fluoridated water is beneficial and safe for the oral health of the public.\u201d\nFor more information on community water fluoridation and ADA advocacy, visit ADA.org/fluoride.\nAbout the American Dental Association The not-for-profit ADA is the nation's largest dental association, representing 154,000 dentist members.

The excess fluoride levels only affect the teeth that are still developing under the gums, and leads to permanent stains on adult teeth.\nChildren under the age of nine should not drink city tap water, Kyle officials warn city residents in the annual water quality report.\n\u201cWe had been giving our kids that water for six months,\u201d said Mosier, a former stay-at-home mom, now a web marketing manager. \u201cIt was a little disconcerting, especially since it\u2019s not something that\u2019s apparent until their adult teeth come out.\u201d\nFor decades, Kyle dentists have seen high levels of fluorosis in their patients, thanks to a drinking water well in Gregg-Clarke Park that draws highly-fluoridated water out of the aquifer. Fluoride levels in the city tap water have actually decreased in recent years, as the city has piped in other sources of well and surface water to mix into the total water supply.\nKyle Mayor Lucy Johnson said the city is monitoring the fluoride levels and was glad to see they didn\u2019t increase from the year prior.\n\u201cHaving more fluoride than normal in this area is actually pretty prevalent,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cYou won\u2019t find a lot of cities around central Texas that don\u2019t have high fluoride. With our water source, there\u2019s not too much we can do about it.\u201d\nJohnson encouraged parents of young children to follow city guidelines, and noted that parents may want to get the water at their home tested for fluoride.\nCity officials say the water that comes out of the tap of most homes in Kyle actually has fluoride levels far below the maximums shown in the water quality report. Homes that are closest to the affected well in Gregg-Clarke Park typically have higher fluoride levels, while those that are farther away have more moderate rates.\nThe water testing showed fluoride levels have decreased slightly in the last two years, likely due to the city connecting its wells.\nIn the report released in the summer of 2008, fluoride levels ranged from 3.29 \u2013 3.3 parts per million (ppm). This year\u2019s report, released in late June, showed the levels at 2.95 \u2013 3.22 ppm. Levels over 2 ppm trigger the automatic warning from the Environmental Protection Agency that children under the age of nine years old should not drink tap water, while long-term consumption of levels higher than 4 ppm may lead to bone damage.\nThe city of Buda also has some elevated levels in isolated testing, but not high enough to trigger a fluoride alert. Buda\u2019s most recent report had levels ranging from 0.23 \u2013 1.94 ppm, with an average of 0.95. The city of Austin maintains its levels at 0.53 ppm.\nMany families such as the Mosiers give their children alternate drinking water, buying or arranging for delivery of bottled water or installing a reverse osmosis filtration system. But that can lead to different set of dental problems. Most bottled water contains little or no fluoride, and dentists suggest giving fluoride supplements to kids who drink bottled water to help prevent cavities. Families can also have their water tested, and then mix filtered and unfiltered water to achieve the correct proportion of fluoride.\nMosier said she would like to see the city address the excess fluoride problem at the level of the city\u2019s water treatment plants, rather than telling residents they need to spend additional money to purchase drinking water for their young children. They also need to do a better job of alerting residents to the problem, she said.\n\u201cI feel like at a minimum, when you open your water account with the city of Kyle, they need to tell you up front,\u201d Mosier said.\nTesting the Waters\nTo get your home tap water tested for fluoride, bring a sample of at least 125 milliliters in a clean container to the Edwards Aquifer Research and Data Center on the Texas State University campus in San Marcos.
