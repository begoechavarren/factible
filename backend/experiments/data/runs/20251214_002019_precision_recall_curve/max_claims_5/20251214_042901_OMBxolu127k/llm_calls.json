    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nThe nation's historical preservation group, is now suing the Trump administration over its plans to build a giant ballroom over at the white House. Back in October, the Trump administration quickly demolished the white House East Wing to make room for the ballroom for this project. Want to bring in CNN's Brian Todd? Brian, why is the National Trust taking this dramatic step? And this is a lengthy lawsuit. It's a lengthy lawsuit, Wolf, 47 pages. It was filed just moments ago. We have a copy of this lawsuit now to answer your question, Wolf. They are suing because they want this project halted, first and foremost. And they're suing because they said that the white House and its allies and in certain agencies like the National Park Service, did not get the necessary approvals or conduct the necessary reviews. We have a copy of this lawsuit. You see the pictures here. This has been what many people have been complaining about, the demolition of the East wing of the white House that began in October for the construction of a 90,000 square foot ballroom. And just moments ago, as Wolf mentioned, we've obtained a copy of this lawsuit from the National Trust for Historic Preservation. They are suing the National Park Service. They are suing President Trump himself, plus the National Park Service, plus the Department of the Interior and Interior Secretary Douglas Burgum, and others over the construction of the ballroom where the east wing and the colonnade used to be. And here is just one quote from one of the initial pages of the lawsuit. No president is legally allowed to tear down portions of the white House without any review whatsoever. Not President Trump, not President Biden, and not anyone else. And no president is legally allowed to construct a ballroom on public property without giving the public the opportunity to weigh in. President Trump's efforts to do so should be immediately halted, and work on the ballroom project should be paused until the defendants complete the required reviews. Reviews that should have taken place before the defendants demolish the East Wing and before they began construction of the ballroom and secured the necessary approvals. What they are also saying is that there are two entities, from which the white House needed to seek approval and at least a review of this project. The National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts. And according to this lawsuit from the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the white House did not seek any review from those agencies and did not seek any, public, input on this project. Now, I can I can tell you also, Wolf, we are reaching out to the white House for comment. Our colleague Kevin Liptak is handling that right now. We should be able to get that from Kevin in just a moment. But what I will say is that the president has had this in his, in his sights to to renovate this area, to do a ballroom for years, not just months, years, including before he came into office. He said he offered the Obama administration, you know, that he said he would pay for it. The Obama administration, he said, never got back to him. President Trump has said many times that he believes this is necessary, that people who come to the white House, for certain events, they have to go to a tent that's kind of separate from the main, main body of the white House. And in bad weather, a lot of people who are here for balls and things like that, they just get kind of, disheveled, having to walk through the rain and get into a tent. That's been his perspective. He's been eyeing this for a long time. His idea is to make this very much like the Donald Trump Ballroom at Mar-A-Lago. It's going to look a lot like that. And there are plenty of other ballrooms that I've been to, many of them. Right near the white House, huge ballrooms that they could go to, not just a. I've been to the tent on the backyard of the white House on this, on this on the North Lawn of the white House, and the South Lawn of the white House as well. And that east wing was beautiful. And too bad it's been destroyed. Ari. Brian, thank you very, very much. Kevin Liptak is over at the white House right now. This has been a huge priority for the president. And as Brian just said, you're working to get some reaction. Are you learning anything? Yeah. The white House hasn't responded to this lawsuit specifically, but I'll tell you that white House officials have sort of downplayed criticism from this particular group, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which you'll remember back in October as this project was getting underway, actually wrote a letter to the white House asking them to pause work to, go through some of these various boards for review. And the white House said at the time that this, trust, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, was comprised of, quote, loser Democrats and liberal donors. And so you see them kind of shrugging off the criticism, we should say that this body is chartered by Congress, tasked with, preserving some of the nation's historic buildings. It actually does have a relationship with President Trump dating back to the 1990s. It worked with him on some projects at Mar-A-Lago. So he does have sort of an existing relationship with this, body, going back several decades. We should say that, the boards that this, group is now requesting and demanding that the court, require that the administration go through the National Capital Planning Commission is now stacked with President Trump's appointees. It's led by Will Scharf, who's the staff secretary at the white House. He has said previously that this project will eventually go before that body, but that it's purview and that its remit does not cover demolition. And that is why they say this project didn't go before that board, before they began tearing down the East wing, but that once sort of vertical construction begins, that it will go before that body. And so, whether this lawsuit sort of spurs that action and prompts them to go more quickly remains to be seen. But you're right. This is an absolute priority of the president. He still mentions that, on almost a weekly basis, you know, when, the crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was here, for example, the president said, that the dinner he held in his honor on the white House state floor would have been a much grander occasion if they had had, that ballroom constructed in his honor. We should also say that there has been some, discord among the planning team. You know, the president has assigned a new architect, the previous architect still on board, but he had reportedly raised some questions about the sheer scale of this project. You know, the president is envisioning a 90,000 square foot ballroom. The white House itself is only about 55,000ft\u00b2. And one of the concerns that the National Trust for Historic Preservation has raised is that they would essentially dwarf the original building once it's completed. And so all of these concerns are now due to be, heard in court, Wolf, the president keeps pointing out that, this ballroom will be paid for by private donations, not taxpayers. Is that a factor here? It could be. And I think, you know, the president and the white House have said that they will be transparent and they have released, some of the names of the donors who will contribute to this project. One of the questions is how potentially they'll be honored as part of it, whether their names will be, written on the wall or whether they'll have sort of plaques, in the final, ballroom to designate who who donated and, what sort of contribution they were able to make to this project. But it has raised a certainly questions about what kind of influence those donors, might have with the white House and whether or not these individuals are essentially using these donations to curry favor with the president, recognizing that this is a major priority of his. All right. Kevin Liptak at the white House for us, Kevin, thank you very, very much.",

But the ballroom was to be 90,000 square feet. It would be larger than the ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nBut his architect is pushing back.\nPresident Donald Trump is advocating for his lavish White House ballroom, currently in the demolition phase, to be even larger than its planned 90,000 square feet. The president is reportedly in discussions with his architect, James McCrery of McCrery Architects, to expand the gilded hall. McCrery, however, is pushing back on the idea, per The Washington Post.\nThe $300 million project, announced in July, has already grown in scale once before. Its current planned seating capacity of 900 represents a 40 percent increase from the original 650.

The White House does not have space to host large-scale events without erecting tents outside.19 Its largest rooms can fit only 200 people, but up to 900 people will be accommodated by the new ballroom.20 When state dinners are set up outside, the \u201conly bathroom facilities for a tent are porta-potties,\u201d says Gahl Hodges Burt, who served as President Ronald Reagan\u2019s social secretary. \u201cSetting up a kitchen out there is hugely expensive. When the tent is up, the helicopter can\u2019t land. And the grass dies.\u201d21\nSupporters also note that past presidents across the political spectrum have made their own changes to the building to fit their needs, especially as the roles and responsibilities of the office of the president have grown. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said, \u201cNearly every single president who has lived in this beautiful White House \u2026 has made modernizations and renovations of their own.\u201d22\nMajor changes made to the White House include the additions of the North Portico, the West Wing, the Oval Office, and the Truman Balcony, plus the East Wing itself.23 And under the Truman administration, the entire interior of the White House was gutted and renovated to reinforce the crumbling building after decades of neglect.24\nIconic features of the White House today were once disparaged when their construction required the demolition of something else. When the Victorian conservatories (greenhouses) attached to the White House were destroyed in 1902 to make way for the West Wing, The Washington Post declared that President Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cattempt to \u2018modernize\u2019 [the White House] has destroyed its historic value and does not seem to have made it much more desirable as a residence.\u201d25 Criticism about cost, necessity, design, and what is lost has been a constant as the White House has changed over the last two centuries.\nCriticism and Concern\nA Yahoo News/YouGov poll found that 57 percent of Americans disapprove of the East Wing\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

At the same time, growing awareness of the value of historic places placed new demands on the NTHP, as did the mid-century boom in urban and suburban construction. To increase its programs, the organization needed to raise private funds. In 1968, the RBF made a $500,000 grant to the NTHP, the largest received for general purposes by the Trust since its 1949 inception. The grant enabled the Trust to expand its professional staff and increase its consultative services to local preservation groups. In the 1990s, the Trust partnered with the Fund to open the Pocantico Historic Area at the Rockefeller Estate in Westchester County, New York for publicly beneficial purposes.\nEvery year, the National Trust for Historic Preservation highlights 11 Most Endangered Historic Places.

However, the lawsuit on Friday is the first formal effort to halt construction.\n\u201cThe White House is arguably the most evocative building in our country and a globally recognised symbol of our powerful American ideals,\u201d Carol Quillen, the president of the organisation, said in a statement.\n\u201cAs the organisation charged with protecting places where our history happened, the National Trust was compelled to file this case,\u201d she said.\nThe filing charges that the Trump administration has violated several laws in beginning construction of the ballroom, including failing to file plans with the National Capital Planning Commission; failing to prepare an environmental assessment; and failing to obtain congressional approval for construction in a federal park.\nIt further states that the totality of the administration\u2019s actions violates the property clause of the US Constitution, which \u201creserves to Congress the right to dispose of and make all rules regarding property belonging to the United States\u201d.\nThe organisation had previously sent a letter to the National Capital Planning Commission, the National Park Service, and the Commission of Fine Arts calling for a pause in construction.\nThe Trump administration has not immediately responded to Friday\u2019s lawsuit but has maintained that planning and construction of the ballroom have been conducted in compliance with the law.\nIn October, Trump aide Steven Cheung, in a post on X, accused the organisation of being \u201crun by a bunch of loser Democrats and liberal donors who are playing political games\u201d.\nTrump, a real estate magnate known for a personal taste that tends toward the garish and gilded, has championed the construction of a new ballroom.\nThe president began demolishing a portion of the White House\u2019s east wing in October. He said the ballroom will seat nearly 1,000 people, up from the 650 seats the administration had previously announced.\nThe price has ballooned from $200m to $300m, although the administration has maintained that the funding is coming from private donors.\nWhile Trump has sought to transform the powers of the executive office and reshape the wider US government, the construction would be the most lasting physical change in Washington, DC, since he took office.\nCritics have said the ballroom would dwarf the White House\u2019s current 55,000-square-foot (16,764-square-metre) footprint and disrupt the balance of the smaller east and west wings.\nWhile presidents have made internal renovations and changes to the White House grounds, the building\u2019s exterior has remained largely unchanged since its reconstruction in the early 1800s.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:\nUse precise geolocation data.

The filing alleges that federal officials are violating the Administrative Procedure Act, the National Environmental Policy Act and the separation of powers under the Constitution.\n\u201cNo president is legally allowed to tear down portions of the White House without any review whatsoever \u2014 not President Trump, not President Biden, and not anyone else,\u201d the lawsuit says. \u201cAnd no president is legally allowed to construct a ballroom on public property without giving the public the opportunity to weigh in.\u201d\nThe lawsuit argues that construction of the ballroom \u201cshould be paused until the Defendants complete the required reviews \u2014 reviews that should have taken place before the Defendants demolished the East Wing, and before they began construction of the Ballroom \u2014 and secure the necessary approvals.\u201d\nThe National Trust for Historic Preservation is a private nonprofit organization established by Congress in 1949 to oversee and promote the preservation of historic sites across the country.\nCarol Quillen, president and CEO of the Trust, first raised concerns about the destruction of the East Wing \u2014 historically home to the offices of the first lady \u2014 in October. In a letter to the leaders of the National Park Service, the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts, she questioned the planned size of the ballroom \u2014 which, at an anticipated 90,000 square feet, would be nearly double the size of the rest of the White House \u2014 and requested the demolition be paused until the proper reviews had been fulfilled. According to the lawsuit filed Friday, Quillen never received a response to the letter.\nQuillen said in a statement that the Trust \u201cwas compelled to file this case.\u201d\n\u201cThe White House is arguably the most evocative building in our country and a globally recognized symbol of our powerful American ideals,\u201d Quillen said.\nWhite House officials have said the ballroom is needed to host larger events, and Trump has pledged that \u201cit\u2019ll be the most beautiful ballroom anywhere in the world I think.\u201d\nIn addition to Trump, the lawsuit names as defendants Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, the leaders of the National Park Service and the General Services Administration, and the superintendent of the White House.\n\u201cPresident Trump has full legal authority to modernize, renovate, and beautify the White House \u2013 just like all of his predecessors did,\u201d White House spokesman Davis Ingle said in a statement to MS NOW.\nAt the National Capital Planning Commission\u2019s Dec. 4 meeting \u2014 the first since the demolition of the East Wing began \u2014 commission chairman Will Scharf said the administration plans to submit the ballroom designs later this month, saying it will then go through the NCPC\u2019s review process at a \u201cnormal and deliberative pace.\u201d A White House official told MS NOW the plans are still being worked on.\nThe White House has maintained that they are still in the demolition phase, despite a construction crane on site.\nNews of the lawsuit was first reported by the Washington Post.\nEarlier this month, the White House hired another D.C.-based architect, Shalom Baranes, in the planning of the ballroom\u2019s construction. A White House official said James McCrery \u2014 the first architect Trump hired for the project, who had been at odds with the president over the size of the ballroom \u2014 remains as a valuable consultant on the ballroom project.\nThe cost of the ballroom has increased to $300 million as of October from its initial estimate of $200 million. Donors funding its construction include several companies and individuals, such as Amazon, Google, Lockheed Martin, Microsoft and Comcast, the parent company of NBCUniversal, which is in the process of spinning off MS NOW as part of a new company. The White House has declined to share the amount Comcast has donated.\nIn late October, Trump said $350 million has already been raised.
