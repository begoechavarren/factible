Their journeys are about to diverge with outcomes that impact nothing less than the fate of the planet. But they weren't always this way. To understand where these bottles end up, we must first explore their origins. The heroes of our story were conceived in this oil refinery. The plastic in their bodies was formed by chemically bonding oil and gas molecules together to make monomers. In turn, these monomers were bonded into long polymer chains to make plastic in the form of millions of pellets. Those were melted at manufacturing plants and reformed in molds to create the resilient material that makes up the triplets' bodies. Machines filled the bottles with sweet bubbily liquid and they were then wrapped, shipped, bought, opened, consumed and unceremoniously discarded. And now here they lie, poised at the edge of the unknown. Bottle one, like hundreds of millions of tons of his plastic brethren, ends up in a landfill. This huge dump expands each day as more trash comes in and continues to take up space. As plastics sit there being compressed amongst layers of other junk, rainwater flows through the waste and absorbs the water-soluble compounds it contains, and some of those are highly toxic. Together, they create a harmful stew called leachate, which can move into groundwater, soil and streams, poisoning ecosystems and harming wildlife. It can take bottle one an agonizing 1,000 years to decompose. Bottle two's journey is stranger but, unfortunately, no happier. He floats on a trickle that reaches a stream, a stream that flows into a river, and a river that reaches the ocean. After months lost at sea, he's slowly drawn into a massive vortex, where trash accumulates, a place known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Here the ocean's currents have trapped millions of pieces of plastic debris. This is one of five plastic-filled gyres in the world's seas. Places where the pollutants turn the water into a cloudy plastic soup. Some animals, like seabirds, get entangled in the mess. They, and others, mistake the brightly colored plastic bits for food. Plastic makes them feel full when they're not, so they starve to death and pass the toxins from the plastic up the food chain. For example, it's eaten by lanternfish, the lanternfish are eaten by squid, the squid are eaten by tuna, and the tuna are eaten by us. And most plastics don't biodegrade, which means they're destined to break down into smaller and smaller pieces called micro plastics, which might rotate in the sea eternally. But bottle three is spared the cruel purgatories of his brothers. A truck brings him to a plant where he and his companions are squeezed flat and compressed into a block. Okay, this sounds pretty bad, too, but hang in there. It gets better. The blocks are shredded into tiny pieces, which are washed and melted, so they become the raw materials that can be used again. As if by magic, bottle three is now ready to be reborn as something completely new. For this bit of plastic with such humble origins, suddenly the sky is the limit.",

Here's how you know we're official.\nGarbage patches are large areas of the ocean where litter, fishing gear, and other debris - known as marine debris - collects. They are formed by rotating ocean currents called \u201cgyres.\u201d You can think of them as big whirlpools that pull objects in. The gyres pull debris into one location, often the gyre\u2019s center, forming \u201cpatches.\u201d\nThere are five gyres in the ocean. One in the Indian Ocean, two in the Atlantic Ocean, and two in the Pacific Ocean. Garbage patches of varying sizes are located in each gyre.\nThe most famous of these patches is often called the \u201cGreat Pacific Garbage Patch.\u201d It is located in the North Pacific Gyre (between Hawaii and California). \u201cPatch\u201d is a misleading nickname, causing many to believe that these are islands of trash. Instead, the debris is spread across the surface of the water and from the surface all the way to the ocean floor. The debris ranges in size, from large abandoned fishing nets to tiny microplastics, which are plastic pieces smaller than 5mm in size. This makes it possible to sail through some areas of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and see very little to no debris.\nThe Great Pacific Garbage Patch is in the Pacific Ocean between Hawaii and California. It is the most well known patch. While some areas of the patch have more trash than others, much of the debris is made of microplastics (by count). Because microplastics are smaller than a pencil eraser, they are not immediately noticeable to the naked eye. It\u2019s more like pepper flakes swirling in a soup than something you can skim off the surface. You may come across larger items, like plastic bottles and nets, but it\u2019s possible to sail through some areas of a garbage patch and not see any debris at all. Garbage patches are huge! It\u2019s difficult to determine an exact size as the trash is constantly moving with ocean currents and winds.\nGarbage patches, especially the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, are far out in the middle of the ocean where people hardly ever go. Because they are so remote, it can be hard to study them. Scientists rarely get to see the impacts of garbage patches on animals first hand. So far, we know that marine debris found in garbage patches can impact wildlife in a number of ways:\nEntanglement and ghost fishing: Marine life can be caught and injured, or potentially killed in certain types of debris. Lost fishing nets are especially dangerous. In fact they are often called \u201cghost\u201d nets because they continue to fish even though they are no longer under the control of a fisher. Ghost nets can trap or wrap around animals, entangling them. Plastic debris with loops can also get hooked on wildlife - think packing straps, six-pack rings, handles of plastic bags, etc.\nIngestion: Animals may mistakenly eat plastic and other debris. We know that this can be harmful to the health of fish, seabirds, and other marine animals. These items can take up room in their stomachs, making the animals feel full and stopping them from eating real food.\nNon-native species: Marine debris can transport species from one place to another. Algae, barnacles, crabs, or other species can attach themselves to debris and be transported across the ocean. If the species is invasive, and can settle and establish in a new environment, it can outcompete or overcrowd native species, disrupting the ecosystem.\nWe don\u2019t know whether, or how, garbage patches are impacting human health. Generally speaking, we know that humans may be exposed to microplastics from a number of sources, such as seafood, sea salt, tap water, beer, and even honey. However, we do not know how or if humans are impacted by this. Plastic microfibers can also be transported in the air and found in household dust (e.g., from furniture, carpet, clothing etc.), so exposure from seafood and other ocean sources may be small in comparison. The research community is actively exploring this issue.\nMarine debris in garbage patches can have other impacts. For example, it may also cause damage to vessels and be a navigation hazard. Marine debris can be difficult to see in the ocean if it\u2019s floating below the water surface. A boat moving through the water can hit the debris, possibly resulting in costly vessel damage. Nets can become entangled in propellers and clog intakes.\nThe answer is that we do not know. The locations and sizes of these garbage patches are not likely to change very much any time soon. However, the amount of debris may continue to grow as more and more debris enters our ocean each year. This growth will likely worsen current impacts on the environment, navigation, vessel safety, and the economy.\nIt may not be possible to entirely get rid of garbage patches. Some of the material will take a very long time to break down in the environment, while other materials, like plastics, may never fully go away. Large debris, like fishing nets, can be removed by people, but debris in the garbage patches is also mostly made up (by count) of plastic pieces smaller than 5mm in size. The debris is also continuously mixed by wind and wave action and is spread from the surface all the way to the ocean floor. Since these microplastics are so small in size, constantly being mixed, and spread out, it would be very difficult to remove them. Finding a cost effective technological solution which can take on these challenges is an extremely daunting task. Unfortunately, we will be dealing with this problem for the foreseeable future.\nHere at the NOAA Marine Debris Program, we focus on marine debris prevention and removal from shorelines and coastal areas where debris is easier to pick up. Prevention is key to solving the marine debris problem over time. If you think about an overflowing sink, the first step before cleaning up the water is to turn the tap off. That is exactly how prevention works. By acting to prevent marine debris, we can stop this problem from growing.\nTo prevent \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Here's how you know we're official.\nGarbage patches are large areas of the ocean where litter, fishing gear, and other debris - known as marine debris - collects. They are formed by rotating ocean currents called \u201cgyres.\u201d You can think of them as big whirlpools that pull objects in. The gyres pull debris into one location, often the gyre\u2019s center, forming \u201cpatches.\u201d\nThere are five gyres in the ocean. One in the Indian Ocean, two in the Atlantic Ocean, and two in the Pacific Ocean. Garbage patches of varying sizes are located in each gyre.\nThe most famous of these patches is often called the \u201cGreat Pacific Garbage Patch.\u201d It is located in the North Pacific Gyre (between Hawaii and California). \u201cPatch\u201d is a misleading nickname, causing many to believe that these are islands of trash. Instead, the debris is spread across the surface of the water and from the surface all the way to the ocean floor. The debris ranges in size, from large abandoned fishing nets to tiny microplastics, which are plastic pieces smaller than 5mm in size. This makes it possible to sail through some areas of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and see very little to no debris.\nThe Great Pacific Garbage Patch is in the Pacific Ocean between Hawaii and California. It is the most well known patch. While some areas of the patch have more trash than others, much of the debris is made of microplastics (by count). Because microplastics are smaller than a pencil eraser, they are not immediately noticeable to the naked eye. It\u2019s more like pepper flakes swirling in a soup than something you can skim off the surface. You may come across larger items, like plastic bottles and nets, but it\u2019s possible to sail through some areas of a garbage patch and not see any debris at all. Garbage patches are huge! It\u2019s difficult to determine an exact size as the trash is constantly moving with ocean currents and winds.\nGarbage patches, especially the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, are far out in the middle of the ocean where people hardly ever go. Because they are so remote, it can be hard to study them. Scientists rarely get to see the impacts of garbage patches on animals first hand. So far, we know that marine debris found in garbage patches can impact wildlife in a number of ways:\nEntanglement and ghost fishing: Marine life can be caught and injured, or potentially killed in certain types of debris. Lost fishing nets are especially dangerous. In fact they are often called \u201cghost\u201d nets because they continue to fish even though they are no longer under the control of a fisher. Ghost nets can trap or wrap around animals, entangling them. Plastic debris with loops can also get hooked on wildlife - think packing straps, six-pack rings, handles of plastic bags, etc.\nIngestion: Animals may mistakenly eat plastic and other debris. We know that this can be harmful to the health of fish, seabirds, and other marine animals. These items can take up room in their stomachs, making the animals feel full and stopping them from eating real food.\nNon-native species: Marine debris can transport species from one place to another. Algae, barnacles, crabs, or other species can attach themselves to debris and be transported across the ocean. If the species is invasive, and can settle and establish in a new environment, it can outcompete or overcrowd native species, disrupting the ecosystem.\nWe don\u2019t know whether, or how, garbage patches are impacting human health. Generally speaking, we know that humans may be exposed to microplastics from a number of sources, such as seafood, sea salt, tap water, beer, and even honey. However, we do not know how or if humans are impacted by this. Plastic microfibers can also be transported in the air and found in household dust (e.g., from furniture, carpet, clothing etc.), so exposure from seafood and other ocean sources may be small in comparison. The research community is actively exploring this issue.\nMarine debris in garbage patches can have other impacts. For example, it may also cause damage to vessels and be a navigation hazard. Marine debris can be difficult to see in the ocean if it\u2019s floating below the water surface. A boat moving through the water can hit the debris, possibly resulting in costly vessel damage. Nets can become entangled in propellers and clog intakes.\nThe answer is that we do not know. The locations and sizes of these garbage patches are not likely to change very much any time soon. However, the amount of debris may continue to grow as more and more debris enters our ocean each year. This growth will likely worsen current impacts on the environment, navigation, vessel safety, and the economy.\nIt may not be possible to entirely get rid of garbage patches. Some of the material will take a very long time to break down in the environment, while other materials, like plastics, may never fully go away. Large debris, like fishing nets, can be removed by people, but debris in the garbage patches is also mostly made up (by count) of plastic pieces smaller than 5mm in size. The debris is also continuously mixed by wind and wave action and is spread from the surface all the way to the ocean floor. Since these microplastics are so small in size, constantly being mixed, and spread out, it would be very difficult to remove them. Finding a cost effective technological solution which can take on these challenges is an extremely daunting task. Unfortunately, we will be dealing with this problem for the foreseeable future.\nHere at the NOAA Marine Debris Program, we focus on marine debris prevention and removal from shorelines and coastal areas where debris is easier to pick up. Prevention is key to solving the marine debris problem over time. If you think about an overflowing sink, the first step before cleaning up the water is to turn the tap off. That is exactly how prevention works. By acting to prevent marine debris, we can stop this problem from growing.\nTo prevent \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

It is located halfway between ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government. Here's how you know we're official.\nGarbage patches are large areas of the ocean where litter, fishing gear, and other debris - known as marine debris - collects. They are formed by rotating ocean currents called \u201cgyres.\u201d You can think of them as big whirlpools that pull objects in. The gyres pull debris into one location, often the gyre\u2019s center, forming \u201cpatches.\u201d\nThere are five gyres in the ocean. One in the Indian Ocean, two in the Atlantic Ocean, and two in the Pacific Ocean. Garbage patches of varying sizes are located in each gyre.\nThe most famous of these patches is often called the \u201cGreat Pacific Garbage Patch.\u201d It is located in the North Pacific Gyre (between Hawaii and California). \u201cPatch\u201d is a misleading nickname, causing many to believe that these are islands of trash. Instead, the debris is spread across the surface of the water and from the surface all the way to the ocean floor. The debris ranges in size, from large abandoned fishing nets to tiny microplastics, which are plastic pieces smaller than 5mm in size. This makes it possible to sail through some areas of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and see very little to no debris.\nThe Great Pacific Garbage Patch is in the Pacific Ocean between Hawaii and California. It is the most well known patch. While some areas of the patch have more trash than others, much of the debris is made of microplastics (by count). Because microplastics are smaller than a pencil eraser, they are not immediately noticeable to the naked eye. It\u2019s more like pepper flakes swirling in a soup than something you can skim off the surface. You may come across larger items, like plastic bottles and nets, but it\u2019s possible to sail through some areas of a garbage patch and not see any debris at all. Garbage patches are huge! It\u2019s difficult to determine an exact size as the trash is constantly moving with ocean currents and winds.\nGarbage patches, especially the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, are far out in the middle of the ocean where people hardly ever go. Because they are so remote, it can be hard to study them. Scientists rarely get to see the impacts of garbage patches on animals first hand. So far, we know that marine debris found in garbage patches can impact wildlife in a number of ways:\nEntanglement and ghost fishing: Marine life can be caught and injured, or potentially killed in certain types of debris. Lost fishing nets are especially dangerous. In fact they are often called \u201cghost\u201d nets because they continue to fish even though they are no longer under the control of a fisher. Ghost nets can trap or wrap around animals, entangling them. Plastic debris with loops can also get hooked on wildlife - think packing straps, six-pack rings, handles of plastic bags, etc.\nIngestion: Animals may mistakenly eat plastic and other debris. We know that this can be harmful to the health of fish, seabirds, and other marine animals. These items can take up room in their stomachs, making the animals feel full and stopping them from eating real food.\nNon-native species: Marine debris can transport species from one place to another. Algae, barnacles, crabs, or other species can attach themselves to debris and be transported across the ocean. If the species is invasive, and can settle and establish in a new environment, it can outcompete or overcrowd native species, disrupting the ecosystem.\nWe don\u2019t know whether, or how, garbage patches are impacting human health. Generally speaking, we know that humans may be exposed to microplastics from a number of sources, such as seafood, sea salt, tap water, beer, and even honey. However, we do not know how or if humans are impacted by this. Plastic microfibers can also be transported in the air and found in household dust (e.g., from furniture, carpet, clothing etc.), so exposure from seafood and other ocean sources may be small in comparison. The research community is actively exploring this issue.\nMarine debris in garbage patches can have other impacts. For example, it may also cause damage to vessels and be a navigation hazard. Marine debris can be difficult to see in the ocean if it\u2019s floating below the water surface. A boat moving through the water can hit the debris, possibly resulting in costly vessel damage. Nets can become entangled in propellers and clog intakes.\nThe answer is that we do not know. The locations and sizes of these garbage patches are not likely to change very much any time soon. However, the amount of debris may continue to grow as more and more debris enters our ocean each year. This growth will likely worsen current impacts on the environment, navigation, vessel safety, and the economy.\nIt may not be possible to entirely get rid of garbage patches. Some of the material will take a very long time to break down in the environment, while other materials, like plastics, may never fully go away. Large debris, like fishing nets, can be removed by people, but debris in the garbage patches is also mostly made up (by count) of plastic pieces smaller than 5mm in size. The debris is also continuously mixed by wind and wave action and is spread from the surface all the way to the ocean floor. Since these microplastics are so small in size, constantly being mixed, and spread out, it would be very difficult to remove them. Finding a cost effective technological solution which can take on these challenges is an extremely daunting task. Unfortunately, we will be dealing with this problem for the foreseeable future.\nHere at the NOAA Marine Debris Program, we focus on marine debris prevention and removal from shorelines and coastal areas where debris is easier to pick up. Prevention is key to solving the marine debris problem over time. If you think about an overflowing sink, the first step before cleaning up the water is to turn the tap off. That is exactly how prevention works. By acting to prevent marine debris, we can stop this problem from growing.\nTo prevent \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Outside of the controlled conditions ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nA research team from the Yale School of the Environment created a first-of-its-kind life cycle assessment methodology to measure the environmental impact of biodegradable microplastics.\nBy Leah Campbell\nOver 20 million tons of plastic are estimated to end up in the environment every year, with much of it breaking down into microplastics that are harmful to the health of humans and wildlife. Biodegradable and bio-based plastics made from organic material are often touted as more sustainable alternatives, but until now, scientists haven\u2019t had the tools to assess the impact of biodegradable plastics that are not disposed of properly.\nA team of researchers from the Center for Industrial Ecology at the Yale School of Environment recently developed a valuable environmental impact assessment method to quantify the climate change and ecotoxicity impacts of biodegradable microplastics in the natural environment. The study, published in Nature Chemical Engineering, was led by postdoctoral associate Zhengyin Piao and co-authored by Yuan Yao, associate professor of industrial ecology and sustainable systems, and doctoral student Amma Asantewaa Agyei Boakye \u201920 MEM.\nOnly 50% of bio-plastics are in fact biodegradable, and many biodegradable options are fossil-fuel based. Outside of the controlled conditions of a waste management facility, biodegradable plastics can have some of the same impacts as conventional plastics, including breaking down into small, problematic pieces. While they take less time to degrade, they also release greenhouse gases.\n\u201cThere are a lot of people doing life cycle assessments for biodegradable plastics without being able to quantify impacts when those plastics enter nature,\u201d said Yao. \u201cThere just hasn\u2019t been any methodology available.\u201d\nWhen plastic engineers try to design plastics, they often think higher biodegradability will definitely always be better. Our results show that it\u2019s not a linear relationship.\u201d\nFor the study, the team modified existing tools to model the fate of biodegradable microplastics in aquatic environments, creating a more dynamic method that can account for fluctuations in emissions as plastics degrade. They tested it using the five types of biodegradable plastics that dominate the global market, two of which were made from petroleum and three from organic material.\nYao noted that it is a common assumption that growing biomass absorbs enough carbon dioxide to offset emissions from disposed bio-based biodegradable plastics. However, the research team found that the release of methane as these microplastics degraded in the natural environment had greater global warming potential than the carbon uptake from biomass growth.\nBiweekly, we highlight three news and research stories about the work we\u2019re doing at Yale School of the Environment.\nThe study also showed that the tradeoff depends on degradation rate and microplastic size. Shifting from conventional options to alternatives that degrade faster may reduce ecotoxicity, but itcould result in higher greenhouse gas emissions. The burden shifting did seem to disappear for smaller microplastics. For the smallest sizes tested \u2014 particles a million times smaller than an inch \u2014 the less biodegradable plastics had the highest emissions and toxicity.\n\u201cWhen plastic engineers try to design plastics, they often think higher biodegradability will definitely always be better,\u201d Yao said. \u201cOur results show that it\u2019s not a linear relationship.\u201d\nThe researchers said they hope the study will inform the design of sustainable plastics and waste management systems moving forward. The team is now refining the model to scale it up for a global analysis.\n\u201cDoing this kind of large-scale analysis is really important to have a better vision of what strategies the plastic industry can take if it wants to reduce all these environmental impacts,\u201d Yao said.\nAssociate Director of Communications\n195 Prospect Street, New Haven, CT 06511\n(203) 432-5100\nadmissions.yse@yale.edu\nCopyright \u00a9 2025, Yale University.

Plastics likely have a ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nPlastic and microplastic pollution has caused a great deal of ecological problems because of its persistence and potential adverse effects on human health. The degradation of plastics through biological processes is of great significance for ecological health, therefore, the feasibility of plastic degradation by microorganisms has attracted a lot of attention. This study comprises a preliminary discussion on the biodegradation mechanism and the advantages and roles of different bacterial enzymes, such as PET hydrolase and PCL-cutinase, in the degradation of different polymers, such as PET and PCL, respectively. With a particular focus on their modes of action and potential enzymatic mechanisms, this review sums up studies on the biological degradation of plastics and microplastics related to mechanisms and influencing factors, along with their enzymes in enhancing the degradation of synthetic plastics in the process. In addition, biodegradation of plastic is also affected by plastic additives and plasticizers. Plasticizers and additives in the composition of plastics can cause harmful impacts. To further improve the degradation efficiency of polymers, various pretreatments to improve the efficiency of biodegradation, which can cause a significant reduction in toxic plastic pollution, were also preliminarily discussed here. The existing research and data show a large number of microorganisms involved in plastic biodegradation, though their specific mechanisms have not been thoroughly explored yet. Therefore, there is a significant potential for employing various bacterial strains for efficient degradation of plastics to improve human health and safety.\nKeywords: plastics, microplastics, biodegradation, microorganism, enzymes, pretreatment\nPlastics have caused a great deal of ecological problems that have attracted a lot of attention worldwide. Plastic products are useful and they bring convenience to our lives. However, as a persistent pollutant, they can remain in natural environment for hundreds of years or longer [1]. In 1950, the global production of plastics (excluding fiber) was 1.3 million tons, and by 2018, it reached an alarming level of 359 million tons (excluding fiber), resulting in widespread environmental contamination [2]. It is estimated that only 10% of plastic waste is recycled, 14% is incinerated, and the rest is dumped into landfills, ultimately entering the natural environment [3]. Plastics are transported through air and water currents, therefore, they not only affect the natural environment but also pose adverse ecological impacts in the deep-sea sediments and polar regions [4]. In fact, plastics and microplastics (MPs, size 5 mm) have been commonly found in freshwater, the atmosphere, and soil environments across the world. A class of high molecular weight polymers is referred to as plastics in general. The formation of \u201cwhite pollution\u201d has caused serious environmental pollution and ecological damage around the world. Polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene (PS), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) are the most widely utilized plastics, with PE and PP making up more than half of global output [5]. Plastic waste is persistent when released into the environment, high polymers may take a much longer time for plastics to degrade in the environment, and even complete degradation of plastics may take centuries [6]. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the pathways of plastic degradation and their efficiency in the environment.\nPlastics are made up of numerous compounds, including a vast range of chemicals. These include basic substances, such as monomers, oligomers, polymers, and additives, and the additives are mainly divided into plasticizers, antioxidants, heat stabilizers, and pigments [7]. Apart from the pristine additives, plastics adsorb chemical pollutants from the surrounding environment, which makes plastics a hub for toxic substances. The microbial degradation of such plastics containing additives and adsorbed chemicals also needs special attention [8]. MPs contain additives with a large amount of mixed chemical components that may bio-accumulate in the food chain [9]. When released into the environment, plastics and MPs can undergo degradation processes, such as hydrolysis, thermal oxidative degradation, biodegradation, electrochemistry, and photodegradation [10]. Microbial biodegradation has been regarded as one of the main ways to effectively deal with plastic pollution [11]. It is a process in which microorganisms use carbon sources in the form of organic matter to metabolize, which can not only produce non-toxic by-products but also provide energy to microorganisms or transform them into other useful products [12]. Biodegradation may effectively reduce the harm of additives to plastics and achieve a better ecological environment [13].\nPlastics likely have a negative impact on biodiversity loss and the life cycle of plastics and plastic pollution may directly change. Microbial degradation is of great significance in reducing the negative impact of plastics. Due to the diversity and richness in the composition of the microbial communities, there will be more possibilities for plastic biodegradation research. We focus on the advantages of biodegradation, especially in terms of bacterial degradation. The literature suggests that the more suitable and eco-friendly way lies in microbial-mediated degradation [9]. Microbial enzymatic degradation will be based on the degradation ability of bacterial enzymes and appropriate biodegradation efficiency [14]. Although knowledge of the environmental degradation of plastics is still limited, the fate and effects of plastics are determined by the type and strength of degradation [2]. Therefore, exploring the ability of bacteria and the interaction between bacterial enzymes and plastics is critical to obtain key biodegradable mi\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Marine debris is litter that ends up in oceans, seas, and other large bodies of water.\nThe Great Pacific Garbage Patch, also known as the Pacific trash vortex, spans waters from the West Coast of North America to Japan. The patch is actually comprised of the Western Garbage Patch, located near Japan, and the Eastern Garbage Patch, located between the U.S. states of Hawai'i and California.\nThese areas of spinning debris are linked together by the North Pacific Subtropical Convergence Zone, located a few hundred kilometers north of Hawai'i. This convergence zone is where warm water from the South Pacific meets up with cooler water from the Arctic. The zone acts like a highway that moves debris from one patch to another.\nThe entire Great Pacific Garbage Patch is bounded by the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) defines a gyre as a large system of swirling ocean currents. Increasingly, however, it also refers to the garbage patch as a vortex of plastic waste and debris broken down into small particles in the ocean. The North Pacific Subtropical Gyre is formed by four currents rotating clockwise around an area of 20 million square kilometers (7.7 million square miles): the California current, the North Equatorial current, the Kuroshio current, and the North Pacific current.\nThe area in the center of a gyre tends to be very calm and stable. The circular motion of the gyre draws debris into this stable center, where it becomes trapped. A plastic water bottle discarded off the coast of California, for instance, takes the California Current south toward Mexico. There, it may catch the North Equatorial Current, which crosses the vast Pacific. Near the coast of Japan, the bottle may travel north on the powerful Kuroshiro Current. Finally, the bottle travels eastward on the North Pacific Current. The gently rolling vortexes of the Eastern and Western Garbage Patches gradually draw in the bottle.\nThe amount of debris in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch accumulates because much of it is not biodegradable. Many plastics, for instance, do not wear down; they simply break into tinier and tinier pieces.\nFor many people, the idea of a \u201cgarbage patch\u201d conjures up images of an island of trash floating on the ocean. In reality, these patches are almost entirely made up of tiny bits of plastic, called microplastics. Microplastics can\u2019t always be seen by the naked eye. Even satellite imagery doesn\u2019t show a giant patch of garbage. The microplastics of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch can simply make the water look like a cloudy soup. This soup is intermixed with larger items, such as fishing gear and shoes.\nThe seafloor beneath the Great Pacific Garbage Patch may also be an underwater trash heap. Oceanographers and ecologists recently discovered that about 70 percent of marine debris actually sinks to the bottom of the ocean.\nWhile oceanographers and climatologists predicted the existence of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, it was a racing boat captain by the name of Charles Moore who actually discovered the trash vortex. Moore was sailing from Hawai'i to California after competing in a yachting race. Crossing the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, Moore and his crew noticed millions of pieces of plastic surrounding his ship.\nMarine Debris\nNo one knows how much debris makes up the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. The North Pacific Subtropical Gyre is too large for scientists to trawl. In addition, not all of the trash floats on the surface. Denser debris can sink centimeters or even several meters beneath the surface, making the vortex\u2019s area nearly impossible to measure.\n80 percent of plastic in the ocean is estimated to come from land-based sources, with the remaining 20 percent coming from boats and other marine sources. These percentages vary by region, however. A 2018 study found that synthetic fishing nets made up nearly half the mass of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, due largely to ocean current dynamics and increased fishing activity in the Pacific Ocean.\nWhile many different types of trash enter the ocean, plastics make up the majority of marine debris for two reasons. First, plastic\u2019s durability, low cost, and malleability mean that it\u2019s being used in more and more consumer and industrial products. Second, plastic goods do not biodegrade but instead, break down into smaller pieces.\nIn the ocean, the sun breaks down these plastics into tinier and tinier pieces, a process known as photodegradation. Most of this debris comes from plastic bags, bottle caps, plastic water bottles, and Styrofoam cups.\nMarine debris can be very harmful to marine life in the gyre. For instance, loggerhead sea turtles often mistake plastic bags for jellies, their favorite food. Albatrosses mistake plastic resin pellets for fish eggs and feed them to chicks, which die of starvation or ruptured organs.\nSeals and other marine mammals are especially at risk. They can get entangled in abandoned plastic fishing nets, which are being discarded largely due to inclement weather and illegal fishing. Seals and other mammals often drown in these forgotten nets\u2014a phenomenon known as \u201cghost fishing.\u201d\nMarine debris can also disturb marine food webs in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre.

Also known as the Pacific trash vortex, the garbage patch is actually two distinct collections of debris bounded by the massive North Pacific Subtropical Gyre.\nMAP BY NOAA\nThis resource is also available in Spanish.\nThe Great Pacific Garbage Patch is a collection of marine debris in the North Pacific Ocean. Marine debris is litter that ends up in oceans, seas, and other large bodies of water.\nThe Great Pacific Garbage Patch, also known as the Pacific trash vortex, spans waters from the West Coast of North America to Japan. The patch is actually comprised of the Western Garbage Patch, located near Japan, and the Eastern Garbage Patch, located between the U.S. states of Hawai'i and California.\nThese areas of spinning debris are linked together by the North Pacific Subtropical Convergence Zone, located a few hundred kilometers north of Hawai'i. This convergence zone is where warm water from the South Pacific meets up with cooler water from the Arctic. The zone acts like a highway that moves debris from one patch to another.\nThe entire Great Pacific Garbage Patch is bounded by the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) defines a gyre as a large system of swirling ocean currents. Increasingly, however, it also refers to the garbage patch as a vortex of plastic waste and debris broken down into small particles in the ocean. The North Pacific Subtropical Gyre is formed by four currents rotating clockwise around an area of 20 million square kilometers (7.7 million square miles): the California current, the North Equatorial current, the Kuroshio current, and the North Pacific current.\nThe area in the center of a gyre tends to be very calm and stable. The circular motion of the gyre draws debris into this stable center, where it becomes trapped. A plastic water bottle discarded off the coast of California, for instance, takes the California Current south toward Mexico. There, it may catch the North Equatorial Current, which crosses the vast Pacific. Near the coast of Japan, the bottle may travel north on the powerful Kuroshiro Current. Finally, the bottle travels eastward on the North Pacific Current. The gently rolling vortexes of the Eastern and Western Garbage Patches gradually draw in the bottle.\nThe amount of debris in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch accumulates because much of it is not biodegradable. Many plastics, for instance, do not wear down; they simply break into tinier and tinier pieces.\nFor many people, the idea of a \u201cgarbage patch\u201d conjures up images of an island of trash floating on the ocean. In reality, these patches are almost entirely made up of tiny bits of plastic, called microplastics. Microplastics can\u2019t always be seen by the naked eye. Even satellite imagery doesn\u2019t show a giant patch of garbage. The microplastics of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch can simply make the water look like a cloudy soup. This soup is intermixed with larger items, such as fishing gear and shoes.\nThe seafloor beneath the Great Pacific Garbage Patch may also be an underwater trash heap. Oceanographers and ecologists recently discovered that about 70 percent of marine debris actually sinks to the bottom of the ocean.\nWhile oceanographers and climatologists predicted the existence of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, it was a racing boat captain by the name of Charles Moore who actually discovered the trash vortex. Moore was sailing from Hawai'i to California after competing in a yachting race. Crossing the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, Moore and his crew noticed millions of pieces of plastic surrounding his ship.\nMarine Debris\nNo one knows how much debris makes up the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. The North Pacific Subtropical Gyre is too large for scientists to trawl. In addition, not all of the trash floats on the surface. Denser debris can sink centimeters or even several meters beneath the surface, making the vortex\u2019s area nearly impossible to measure.\n80 percent of plastic in the ocean is estimated to come from land-based sources, with the remaining 20 percent coming from boats and other marine sources. These percentages vary by region, however. A 2018 study found that synthetic fishing nets made up nearly half the mass of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, due largely to ocean current dynamics and increased fishing activity in the Pacific Ocean.\nWhile many different types of trash enter the ocean, plastics make up the majority of marine debris for two reasons. First, plastic\u2019s durability, low cost, and malleability mean that it\u2019s being used in more and more consumer and industrial products. Second, plastic goods do not biodegrade but instead, break down into smaller pieces.\nIn the ocean, the sun breaks down these plastics into tinier and tinier pieces, a process known as photodegradation. Most of this debris comes from plastic bags, bottle caps, plastic water bottles, and Styrofoam cups.\nMarine debris can be very harmful to marine life in the gyre. For instance, loggerhead sea turtles often mistake plastic bags for jellies, their favorite food. Albatrosses mistake plastic resin pellets for fish eggs and feed them to chicks, which die of starvation or ruptured organs.\nSeals and other marine mammals are especially at risk. They can get entangled in abandoned plastic fishing nets, which are being discarded largely due to inclement weather and illegal fishing. Seals and other mammals often drown in these forgotten nets\u2014a phenomenon known as \u201cghost fishing.\u201d\nMarine debris can also disturb marine food webs in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre.

The wind on the beach just snatched a plastic bag out of your hand and now it\u2019s cartwheeling down the shoreline faster than you can run after it. Look at that thing go. The wind catches it like a kite. It swoops high over the surf and then dives into the sea. You feel guilty, of course, for littering. But maybe the bag will later wash up on shore and somebody will put it in a trash bin.\nIt\u2019s more likely, though, that your plastic bag will be shredded to bits. On the sea surface, ultraviolet radiation in sunlight makes plastic brittle, and heat and wave action shear it off in flakes. Over time, the flakes are shredded further by the elements, becoming smaller and smaller and smaller \u2014until they can become food particles for tiny organisms.\nSome plastic flakes drift like snow down the water column where fish can consume them. Other bits fall farther to the muddy bottom where they are gobbled up by grass shrimp and other creatures. Still other plastic pieces wash up onto beaches and salt marshes where they become food for burrowing worms and filter-feeding oysters.\nBut maybe your plastic bag remains intact and washes up on a beach or a salt marsh. The same weathering processes will degrade it there. Plastic breaks up far faster on a hot, bright, abrasive place like a salt marsh or beach than it does in colder, deeper water.\n\u201cIf you have a plastic bottle that\u2019s sitting up in the marsh,\u201d says S.C. Sea Grant researcher John Weinstein, a biologist at The Citadel, \u201cit\u2019s going to fragment from sunlight and wave action. It may take a long time, but someday that bottle will disappear from view. Its fragments, though, will still be there, and they will get smaller until they become particles. The plastic will still be in the environment. It just won\u2019t be of a size that we can see. But it could be the right size for organisms in the salt marsh that ordinarily feed on bits of detritus or other particles. My analogy is that we\u2019re sweeping these plastics under the rug. We can\u2019t see them anymore, but they\u2019re still there.\u201d\nPlastic Food. John Weinstein, a biologist at The Citadel, notes that plastic items trapped in salt marshes will eventually deteriorate into particles that can endanger the health of tiny grazing animals. Photo by Grace Beahm.\nMany animals, of course, can suffocate on plastic bags after ingesting them. Sea turtles, for instance, mistake plastic bags for jellyfish. Albatrosses mistake red plastic pieces for squid; photos of bird corpses show dozens of red bottle caps in their decayed guts. Plastics can block or abrade animals\u2019 guts, so they can\u2019t get adequate nutrition and they starve. Other animals lose the energy to search for food, fend off predators, or reproduce.\nNow scientists are finding compelling evidence that tiny bits of plastic in the ocean can be just as dangerous for small marine life.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) defines microplastics as pieces smaller than 5 millimeters in diameter, or about the diameter of a pencil eraser. But many scientists, including Weinstein, define microplastics as items smaller than 1 millimeter, which is also the upper size limit of plankton and detritus particles that many aquatic organisms consume as food.\nMicroplastics have shown up in the guts of mussels, barnacles, worms, fish, and many other creatures. In a series of experiments, Richard Thompson, at biologist at Plymouth University in Britain, added plastic particles and fibers to the diet of three different bottom-feeding creatures: lugworms, barnacles, and sand fleas. The animals consumed the plastic items. The plastic items passed through the guts of some individuals. But others were not so lucky; the particles blocked up their guts and killed them.\nJohn Weinstein is studying how grass shrimp (Palaemonetes pugio) respond to a diet of plastic beads.\nA crustacean about the size of half of a shelled peanut, a grass shrimp consumes microalgae that grow on plant detritus\u2014especially decomposing saltmarsh stems called \u201cwrack\u201d\u2014along estuaries and coasts, but it\u2019s also a predator on a wide variety of small animals.\nBecause of its abundance, sensitivity, and ecological importance in southeastern U.S. estuaries, the grass shrimp is often used to study the effects of pollution in the field and laboratory.\nIn Weinstein\u2019s lab, Austin Gray, a graduate student in biology at The Citadel, has been feeding grass shrimp two types of beads: one a bright green and the other one translucent.\nThe green beads are polyethylene, the type of plastic used in plastic bags, bottles, plastic wrap and other films for food preservation, and many other products. Polyethylene is the most common type of plastic found in marine debris around the world.\nThe translucent beads are polypropylene, a type of plastic used in bottle caps, candy- or chip-wrappers, and food containers. Polypropylene is the second most common type of plastic found in marine debris.\nIn a lab dish, Austin Gray deposits translucent 75-micron beads. But a visitor looks in the dish and can\u2019t find a single bead. Under the dissecting microscope, though, dozens of tiny spheres suddenly appear.

But maybe the bag will later wash up on shore and somebody will put it in a trash bin.\nIt\u2019s more likely, though, that your plastic bag will be shredded to bits. On the sea surface, ultraviolet radiation in sunlight makes plastic brittle, and heat and wave action shear it off in flakes. Over time, the flakes are shredded further by the elements, becoming smaller and smaller and smaller \u2014until they can become food particles for tiny organisms.\nSome plastic flakes drift like snow down the water column where fish can consume them. Other bits fall farther to the muddy bottom where they are gobbled up by grass shrimp and other creatures. Still other plastic pieces wash up onto beaches and salt marshes where they become food for burrowing worms and filter-feeding oysters.\nBut maybe your plastic bag remains intact and washes up on a beach or a salt marsh.

It may take a long time, but someday that bottle will disappear from view. Its fragments, though, will still be there, and they will get smaller until they become particles. The plastic will still be in the environment. It just won\u2019t be of a size that we can see. But it could be the right size for organisms in the salt marsh that ordinarily feed on bits of detritus or other particles. My analogy is that we\u2019re sweeping these plastics under the rug. We can\u2019t see them anymore, but they\u2019re still there.\u201d\nPlastic Food. John Weinstein, a biologist at The Citadel, notes that plastic items trapped in salt marshes will eventually deteriorate into particles that can endanger the health of tiny grazing animals. Photo by Grace Beahm.\nMany animals, of course, can suffocate on plastic bags after ingesting them. Sea turtles, for instance, mistake plastic bags for jellyfish. Albatrosses mistake red plastic pieces for squid; photos of bird corpses show dozens of red bottle caps in their decayed guts. Plastics can block or abrade animals\u2019 guts, so they can\u2019t get adequate nutrition and they starve. Other animals lose the energy to search for food, fend off predators, or reproduce.\nNow scientists are finding compelling evidence that tiny bits of plastic in the ocean can be just as dangerous for small marine life.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) defines microplastics as pieces smaller than 5 millimeters in diameter, or about the diameter of a pencil eraser. But many scientists, including Weinstein, define microplastics as items smaller than 1 millimeter, which is also the upper size limit of plankton and detritus particles that many aquatic organisms consume as food.\nMicroplastics have shown up in the guts of mussels, barnacles, worms, fish, and many other creatures. In a series of experiments, Richard Thompson, at biologist at Plymouth University in Britain, added plastic particles and fibers to the diet of three different bottom-feeding creatures: lugworms, barnacles, and sand fleas. The animals consumed the plastic items. The plastic items passed through the guts of some individuals. But others were not so lucky; the particles blocked up their guts and killed them.\nJohn Weinstein is studying how grass shrimp (Palaemonetes pugio) respond to a diet of plastic beads.\nA crustacean about the size of half of a shelled peanut, a grass shrimp consumes microalgae that grow on plant detritus\u2014especially decomposing saltmarsh stems called \u201cwrack\u201d\u2014along estuaries and coasts, but it\u2019s also a predator on a wide variety of small animals.\nBecause of its abundance, sensitivity, and ecological importance in southeastern U.S. estuaries, the grass shrimp is often used to study the effects of pollution in the field and laboratory.\nIn Weinstein\u2019s lab, Austin Gray, a graduate student in biology at The Citadel, has been feeding grass shrimp two types of beads: one a bright green and the other one translucent.\nThe green beads are polyethylene, the type of plastic used in plastic bags, bottles, plastic wrap and other films for food preservation, and many other products. Polyethylene is the most common type of plastic found in marine debris around the world.\nThe translucent beads are polypropylene, a type of plastic used in bottle caps, candy- or chip-wrappers, and food containers.

Smaller particles capture waterborne contaminants.\nMicroplastics Created. On the beach, sunlight and surf will break up plastic bottles and cups into tiny pieces that can\u2019t be seen with the naked eye.

The wind on the beach just snatched a plastic bag out of your hand and now it\u2019s cartwheeling down the shoreline faster than you can run after it. Look at that thing go. The wind catches it like a kite. It swoops high over the surf and then dives into the sea. You feel guilty, of course, for littering. But maybe the bag will later wash up on shore and somebody will put it in a trash bin.\nIt\u2019s more likely, though, that your plastic bag will be shredded to bits. On the sea surface, ultraviolet radiation in sunlight makes plastic brittle, and heat and wave action shear it off in flakes. Over time, the flakes are shredded further by the elements, becoming smaller and smaller and smaller \u2014until they can become food particles for tiny organisms.\nSome plastic flakes drift like snow down the water column where fish can consume them. Other bits fall farther to the muddy bottom where they are gobbled up by grass shrimp and other creatures. Still other plastic pieces wash up onto beaches and salt marshes where they become food for burrowing worms and filter-feeding oysters.\nBut maybe your plastic bag remains intact and washes up on a beach or a salt marsh. The same weathering processes will degrade it there. Plastic breaks up far faster on a hot, bright, abrasive place like a salt marsh or beach than it does in colder, deeper water.\n\u201cIf you have a plastic bottle that\u2019s sitting up in the marsh,\u201d says S.C. Sea Grant researcher John Weinstein, a biologist at The Citadel, \u201cit\u2019s going to fragment from sunlight and wave action. It may take a long time, but someday that bottle will disappear from view. Its fragments, though, will still be there, and they will get smaller until they become particles. The plastic will still be in the environment. It just won\u2019t be of a size that we can see. But it could be the right size for organisms in the salt marsh that ordinarily feed on bits of detritus or other particles. My analogy is that we\u2019re sweeping these plastics under the rug. We can\u2019t see them anymore, but they\u2019re still there.\u201d\nPlastic Food. John Weinstein, a biologist at The Citadel, notes that plastic items trapped in salt marshes will eventually deteriorate into particles that can endanger the health of tiny grazing animals. Photo by Grace Beahm.\nMany animals, of course, can suffocate on plastic bags after ingesting them. Sea turtles, for instance, mistake plastic bags for jellyfish. Albatrosses mistake red plastic pieces for squid; photos of bird corpses show dozens of red bottle caps in their decayed guts. Plastics can block or abrade animals\u2019 guts, so they can\u2019t get adequate nutrition and they starve. Other animals lose the energy to search for food, fend off predators, or reproduce.\nNow scientists are finding compelling evidence that tiny bits of plastic in the ocean can be just as dangerous for small marine life.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) defines microplastics as pieces smaller than 5 millimeters in diameter, or about the diameter of a pencil eraser. But many scientists, including Weinstein, define microplastics as items smaller than 1 millimeter, which is also the upper size limit of plankton and detritus particles that many aquatic organisms consume as food.\nMicroplastics have shown up in the guts of mussels, barnacles, worms, fish, and many other creatures. In a series of experiments, Richard Thompson, at biologist at Plymouth University in Britain, added plastic particles and fibers to the diet of three different bottom-feeding creatures: lugworms, barnacles, and sand fleas. The animals consumed the plastic items. The plastic items passed through the guts of some individuals. But others were not so lucky; the particles blocked up their guts and killed them.\nJohn Weinstein is studying how grass shrimp (Palaemonetes pugio) respond to a diet of plastic beads.\nA crustacean about the size of half of a shelled peanut, a grass shrimp consumes microalgae that grow on plant detritus\u2014especially decomposing saltmarsh stems called \u201cwrack\u201d\u2014along estuaries and coasts, but it\u2019s also a predator on a wide variety of small animals.\nBecause of its abundance, sensitivity, and ecological importance in southeastern U.S. estuaries, the grass shrimp is often used to study the effects of pollution in the field and laboratory.\nIn Weinstein\u2019s lab, Austin Gray, a graduate student in biology at The Citadel, has been feeding grass shrimp two types of beads: one a bright green and the other one translucent.\nThe green beads are polyethylene, the type of plastic used in plastic bags, bottles, plastic wrap and other films for food preservation, and many other products. Polyethylene is the most common type of plastic found in marine debris around the world.\nThe translucent beads are polypropylene, a type of plastic used in bottle caps, candy- or chip-wrappers, and food containers. Polypropylene is the second most common type of plastic found in marine debris.\nIn a lab dish, Austin Gray deposits translucent 75-micron beads. But a visitor looks in the dish and can\u2019t find a single bead. Under the dissecting microscope, though, dozens of tiny spheres suddenly appear. To put it in perspective, an item at about 40 microns is the width of two spooning human hairs.\nGray fed 16 grass shrimp a die\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",
