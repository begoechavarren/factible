    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nThe week of Valentine's Day 2021, the temperature dropped below zero. Nobody could remember it being this cold for this long. This was Texas, not Siberia. But Texas is the energy state. There was nothing to fear. Just go home, turn on the heat, and hunker down. That's how it should have gone. Instead, over five days, four million Texans lost power during what turned out to be the coldest winter storm in a half a century. Hundreds died, including an 11-year-old boy who froze to death in his sleep. The state's electric grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, ERCOT, later reported the state was just four minutes away from total grid collapse. The media was quick to blame the state government for not being fully prepared and not acting fast enough. This may be true, but ERCOT's mistakes were symptoms, not the cause, of the problem. The real cause is decades of misguided policies that have left the Lone Star state with an unreliable energy infrastructure. It's a cautionary tale that the rest of the country needs to learn from. From 2010 to 2020, the population of Texas increased by 4 million people, and the state's economy grew by 35%. But while all this growth was happening, the state's reliable energy capacity was actually shrinking. Meanwhile, its unreliable energy capacity was surging. In fact, it almost tripled. Let's break this down. Reliable energy is fossil fuels\u2014coal and natural gas\u2014and nuclear. These fuels produce a near-constant flow of electricity. Unreliable, or variable energy, is renewable energy\u2014wind and solar. They're unreliable because they depend on the whims of Mother Nature. In 2020, Texans got 25% of their energy from renewables. During the February storm, however, that fell to 8%, at one point reaching a deadly low of just 1.5%. The reason? Renewable energy only works when the weather cooperates, but it's useless when it doesn't\u2014like when it conjures up a giant snowstorm. Solar panels don't capture sunlight and wind turbines don't spin when covered in snow and ice. Given renewables' unreliability, how is it that Texas, of all places, became so dependent on them? That story begins in 1999, when Texas politicians on the left and the right fell in love with the idea that they could turn the state into a green energy powerhouse. It sounded like a great idea at the time: Instead of passing any new mandates, they would do it by offering massive subsidies, marketed as \"incentives,\" to produce wind and solar power. This ended up working out great for the wind and solar companies, but not so great for reliable energy providers. To illustrate this, imagine that you own a restaurant. One day you learn that your competitor down the street is getting government support. He gets so much help that, instead of charging his customers, he can pay them to eat his food. Not surprisingly, your customers abandon your restaurant for his. Your competitor prospers off the taxpayers' backs while your business withers. Let's apply this analogy to the real world of renewable energy. Wind and solar get so much in subsidies they're guaranteed a profit. And unlike fossil fuel producers, they're not even required to provide reliable power. It's no wonder fossil fuel plants are closing, and nuclear plants are not being built. The wind and solar companies are protected from the laws of supply and demand. They can't lose, and the fossil fuel plants can't compete. That's how out of whack the Texas electricity market has become. Since 2006, the state has subsidized renewable energy to the tune of $19 billion. All of this came right out of Texans' wallets, courtesy of ever-increasing electric bills and rising property taxes. And what does Texas have to show for it? An electric grid that failed when Texans needed it most. Unfortunately, this scenario is playing out across America. Over the past decade, the federal government has spent over $230 billion on energy subsidies, and that doesn't even include subsidies the states give away. It's true that Uncle Sam also grants favors to fossil fuel companies. Renewable energy advocates love to point this out, but here's what they neglect to mention: compared to fossil fuel companies, for every unit of electricity generated, Washington subsidizes wind 17 times and solar 75 times more. Yet, despite all this aid, renewables provide just 4 percent of the country's total energy supply. The verdict is in: renewable energy is expensive and unreliable. And if it can render America's leading power producer powerless, it can do the same to your state. Government meddling got us into this mess. It's time for politicians to step aside and let the free market get us out of it. I'm Jason Isaac from the Texas Public Policy Foundation, for Prager University.",

The storms triggered the worst energy infrastructure failure in Texas state history, leading to shortages of water, food, and heat.[8] More than 4.5 million homes and businesses were left without power,[9][10][11][12] some for several days. At least 246 people were killed directly or indirectly,[3] with some estimates as high as 702 killed as a result of the crisis.[4]\nState officials, including Republican governor Greg Abbott,[13] initially erroneously blamed[14] the outages on frozen wind turbines and solar panels. Data showed that failure to winterize traditional power sources, principally natural gas infrastructure but also to a lesser extent wind turbines, had caused the grid failure,[15][16] with a drop in power production from natural gas more than five times greater than that from wind turbines. Texas's power grid has long been separate from the two major national grids to avoid federal oversight, though it is still connected to the other national grids and Mexico's;[17] the limited number of ties made it difficult for the state to import electricity from other states during the crisis.[18] Deregulation of its electricity market beginning in the 1990s resulted in competition in wholesale electricity prices, but also cost cutting for contingency preparation.[18]\nThe crisis drew much attention to the state's lack of preparedness for such storms,[19] and to a report from U.S. federal regulators ten years earlier that had warned Texas that its power plants would fail in sufficiently cold conditions.[20][21] Damages due to the cold wave and winter storm were estimated to be at least $195 billion,[5] likely the most expensive disaster in the state's history.[22] According to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the Texas power grid was four minutes and 37 seconds away from complete failure when partial grid shutdowns were implemented.[23][24] During the crisis, some energy firms made billions in profits, while others went bankrupt, due to some firms being able to pass extremely high wholesale prices ($9,000/MWh, typically $50/MWh) on to consumers, while others could not, with this price being allegedly held at the $9,000 cap by ERCOT for two days longer than necessary, creating $16 billion in unnecessary charges.[25][26]\nIn 2011, Texas was hit by the Groundhog Day blizzard between February 1 and 5, resulting in rolling blackouts across more than 75% of the state.[27] Many roads around Houston were impassable, and boil-water advisories were issued in several areas.[28] Following this disaster, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation made several recommendations for upgrading Texas's electrical infrastructure to prevent a similar event occurring in the future, but these recommendations were ignored due to the cost of winterizing the systems.[29] At the time the blackouts and failures in the power grid were likened to those that occurred in December 1989, after which similar recommendations were made to the state government and ERCOT, which were similarly ignored.[30][29] On August 16, 2011, a 357-page report was released by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in response to the February 2011 power outage in Texas.[31]\nIn mid-February 2021, a series of severe winter storms swept across the United States. This outbreak was due to the polar jet stream dipping particularly far south into the U.S.,[32] stretching from Washington to Texas, and running back north along the East Coast, allowing a polar vortex to bring very cold air across the country, and spawning multiple storms along the jet stream track as a result.[33] This weather phenomenon resulted in record low temperatures throughout Texas, with temperatures in Dallas, Austin, Houston and San Antonio falling below temperatures in Anchorage, Alaska.[34]\nOn February 10, a winter storm formed north of the Gulf coast, dropping significant amounts of sleet and ice on many states in the Deep South and the Ohio Valley, including Texas, Georgia, Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee, as well as states on the East Coast.[35] A second storm developed off the Pacific Northwest on February 13 and began to gradually develop into an organized storm as it tracked southward toward Texas. It grew even more organized as it turned toward the northeast U.S. before splitting in half \u2014 one half continuing into Quebec and the other moving out over the Atlantic Ocean.[36]\nThis storm, along with various other storms from the previous two weeks, resulted in over 75% of the contiguous U.S. being covered in snow.[37] This storm was directly responsible for nearly 10 million people losing power, with 5.2 million in the U.S. and 4.7 million in Mexico.[38][9] A third winter storm caused an additional 4 million power outages, and 29 deaths, with 23 in the U.S. and 6 in Mexico. At least 246 people lost their lives during the winter storms.[3][39][40]\nThe winter storm caused a record low temperature at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport of \u22122 \u00b0F (\u221219 \u00b0C) on February 16, the coldest in North Texas in 72 years.[44] Many Texan homes, though typically well-insulated to deal with extreme summer heat, may have lower efficiency heating systems, many with heat pumps backed up by inefficient electric resistance heaters for extreme cold ambient temperatures, resulting in extremely high electricity demand in those conditions.[22] Power equipment in Texas was not winterized, leaving it vulnerable to extended periods of cold weather.[45][46] Natural gas power generating facilities had equipment freeze up and faced shortages of fuel. Texas Governor Greg Abbott and some other politicians initially said renewable energy sources were the cause for the power outages, citing frozen wind turbines as an example of their unreliability.[47]\nVir\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The storms triggered the worst energy infrastructure failure in Texas state history, leading to shortages of water, food, and heat.[8] More than 4.5 million homes and businesses were left without power,[9][10][11][12] some for several days. At least 246 people were killed directly or indirectly,[3] with some estimates as high as 702 killed as a result of the crisis.[4]\nState officials, including Republican governor Greg Abbott,[13] initially erroneously blamed[14] the outages on frozen wind turbines and solar panels. Data showed that failure to winterize traditional power sources, principally natural gas infrastructure but also to a lesser extent wind turbines, had caused the grid failure,[15][16] with a drop in power production from natural gas more than five times greater than that from wind turbines. Texas's power grid has long been separate from the two major national grids to avoid federal oversight, though it is still connected to the other national grids and Mexico's;[17] the limited number of ties made it difficult for the state to import electricity from other states during the crisis.[18] Deregulation of its electricity market beginning in the 1990s resulted in competition in wholesale electricity prices, but also cost cutting for contingency preparation.[18]\nThe crisis drew much attention to the state's lack of preparedness for such storms,[19] and to a report from U.S. federal regulators ten years earlier that had warned Texas that its power plants would fail in sufficiently cold conditions.[20][21] Damages due to the cold wave and winter storm were estimated to be at least $195 billion,[5] likely the most expensive disaster in the state's history.[22] According to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the Texas power grid was four minutes and 37 seconds away from complete failure when partial grid shutdowns were implemented.[23][24] During the crisis, some energy firms made billions in profits, while others went bankrupt, due to some firms being able to pass extremely high wholesale prices ($9,000/MWh, typically $50/MWh) on to consumers, while others could not, with this price being allegedly held at the $9,000 cap by ERCOT for two days longer than necessary, creating $16 billion in unnecessary charges.[25][26]\nIn 2011, Texas was hit by the Groundhog Day blizzard between February 1 and 5, resulting in rolling blackouts across more than 75% of the state.[27] Many roads around Houston were impassable, and boil-water advisories were issued in several areas.[28] Following this disaster, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation made several recommendations for upgrading Texas's electrical infrastructure to prevent a similar event occurring in the future, but these recommendations were ignored due to the cost of winterizing the systems.[29] At the time the blackouts and failures in the power grid were likened to those that occurred in December 1989, after which similar recommendations were made to the state government and ERCOT, which were similarly ignored.[30][29] On August 16, 2011, a 357-page report was released by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in response to the February 2011 power outage in Texas.[31]\nIn mid-February 2021, a series of severe winter storms swept across the United States. This outbreak was due to the polar jet stream dipping particularly far south into the U.S.,[32] stretching from Washington to Texas, and running back north along the East Coast, allowing a polar vortex to bring very cold air across the country, and spawning multiple storms along the jet stream track as a result.[33] This weather phenomenon resulted in record low temperatures throughout Texas, with temperatures in Dallas, Austin, Houston and San Antonio falling below temperatures in Anchorage, Alaska.[34]\nOn February 10, a winter storm formed north of the Gulf coast, dropping significant amounts of sleet and ice on many states in the Deep South and the Ohio Valley, including Texas, Georgia, Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee, as well as states on the East Coast.[35] A second storm developed off the Pacific Northwest on February 13 and began to gradually develop into an organized storm as it tracked southward toward Texas. It grew even more organized as it turned toward the northeast U.S. before splitting in half \u2014 one half continuing into Quebec and the other moving out over the Atlantic Ocean.[36]\nThis storm, along with various other storms from the previous two weeks, resulted in over 75% of the contiguous U.S. being covered in snow.[37] This storm was directly responsible for nearly 10 million people losing power, with 5.2 million in the U.S. and 4.7 million in Mexico.[38][9] A third winter storm caused an additional 4 million power outages, and 29 deaths, with 23 in the U.S. and 6 in Mexico. At least 246 people lost their lives during the winter storms.[3][39][40]\nThe winter storm caused a record low temperature at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport of \u22122 \u00b0F (\u221219 \u00b0C) on February 16, the coldest in North Texas in 72 years.[44] Many Texan homes, though typically well-insulated to deal with extreme summer heat, may have lower efficiency heating systems, many with heat pumps backed up by inefficient electric resistance heaters for extreme cold ambient temperatures, resulting in extremely high electricity demand in those conditions.[22] Power equipment in Texas was not winterized, leaving it vulnerable to extended periods of cold weather.[45][46] Natural gas power generating facilities had equipment freeze up and faced shortages of fuel. Texas Governor Greg Abbott and some other politicians initially said renewable energy sources were the cause for the power outages, citing frozen wind turbines as an example of their unreliability.[47]\nVir\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

General hospitals offer a comprehensive range of services and facilities for medical diagnoses and treatments, including surgical services.

Winter Storm Uri was an overlapping emergency with overwhelming and cascading statewide impacts to power, water, transportation, communications, and all of our livelihoods. Before the storm arrived, the Austin-Travis County Emergency Operations Center along with City and County departments had already been operating for 11 months on the COVID-19 response. City of Austin and Travis County departments along with community partners had recently ramped up mass vaccination sites; the COVID-19 Alternate Care Site (ACS) at the Austin Convention Center had supported 215 patients; and COVID-19 Protective Lodges, Isolation Facilities, and testing sites operated across Austin-Travis County region. On February 14, 2021, Winter Storm Uri arrived in the Austin area as an additional emergency, taxing already strained resources; and the storm\u2019s impacts escalated quickly. Austin received more than six inches of snow, nearly an inch of ice from freezing rain, and consecutive days of below-freezing temperatures. Statewide supply chains buckled and, at times, stopped functioning, further complicating the procurement of food and potable water. There were 381 water line breaks in City pipelines, and more than 200 apartment complexes lost water due to private plumbing damage.A City-wide boil water notice was issued on February 17 and was in effect for six days. Approximately two weeks later, warmer temperatures returned to the region. The boil water notice was rescinded in stages for residents, then completely lifted on February 23. Power was restored to 100% of Austin Energy customers by February 21. As Austinites gradually recovered, the City and County continued operating food and water distribution sites while demobilizing warming centers and overnight shelters. Eventually, the Palmer Events Center closed to residents on February 26, 2021. After all was said and done, the City and Travis County jointly: Responded to more than 700 traffic accidents Answered more 911 calls than ever before for five consecutive days Assisted hospitals, long-term care facilities, dialysis centers and other community lifelines remain open to care for the community Sheltered more than 1,000 people in dozens of locations Provided thousands of meals to those sheltered Established a medical shelter to help those who needed power for medical equipment or other medical treatments Sustained COVID-19 operations including the Alternate Care Site, multiple Isolation Facilities and Protective Lodges Placed 60 water tanks for bulk water distribution at apartment complexes Distributed 52,000 gallons of bulk water using tanker trucks Installed 65 fire hydrant adapters to provide access to potable water throughout the community Repaired 381 water line breaks in City system in 10 days Responded to more than 1,500 emergency water shutoffs for customers Nationwide, Winter Storm Uri resulted in more than 170 million Americans being placed under winter weather alerts issued by the National Weather Service and caused more than five million people in the United States to experience blackouts, and nearly 18 million Texans experienced a boil water notice. In the State of Texas, Winter Storm Uri created more than $195 billion in damage, making it the costliest natural disaster in Texas history.

General hospitals offer a comprehensive range of services and facilities for medical diagnoses and treatments, including surgical services. Special hospitals provide clinical laboratory facilities, diagnostic X-ray facilities, treatment facilities or other definitive medical treatments.\nFor a list of facilities offering services other than hospitals \u2014 such as rural health clinics, community mental health centers and birthing centers \u2014 visit Texas Health and Human Services. Each of the Comptroller\u2019s economic regions offers a variety of hospital options (Exhibit 6).\nNote: State psychiatric hospitals data as of February 2019 Source: Texas Department of Health and Human Services\nAccess to health care facilities adds to the viability of a community. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the share of Texans without health insurance \u2014 18.4 percent in 2019 \u2014 was twice the national average of 9.2 percent.\nIn 2019, the rate of uninsured people in Texas ranged from a low of 16.1 percent in the Capital region to a high of 24.9 percent in the South Texas region (Exhibit 7). (For additional information, see Uninsured Texans, Fiscal Notes, October 2020.)\nNote: Uninsured population includes under 65 (ages 0-64) only. Source: U.S. Census Bureau, SAHIE (Small Area Health Insurance Estimates)\nIn 2020, Texas had a gross domestic product (GDP) of $1.8 trillion, about 8.5 percent of the U.S. GDP. Between 2010 and 2020, Texas GDP rose by an average annual rate of 3.6 percent, more than the national average annual rate of 3.3 percent. In 2020, Texas GDP fell from the previous year by 4.7 percent, more than the national GDP fall of 2.2 percent. (GDP values not adjusted for inflation.) Preliminary data for the first two quarters of 2021, however, suggest a significant economic rebound in many industries and regions.\nThere were 13.2 million people employed in Texas in 2020, a 17.1 percent rise from 2010. U.S. employment, by comparison, rose by 7.8 percent during this period (Exhibit 8).\nSource: JobsEQ using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages\nIn the five-year period between 2015 and 2020, industry employment in Texas rose by 3.3 percent, or about 420,000 jobs. During this period, by comparison, U.S. industry employment fell by 0.5 percent.\nThe state\u2019s largest industries by employment levels are in restaurants, education and health care services. Among these industries, grocery stores, physicians\u2019 offices and postsecondary schools have seen considerable job growth in the past five years (Exhibit 9).\nSource: JobsEQ using data provided by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages\nTexas industries that experienced the largest total job gains between 2015 and 2\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Statewide supply ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nData About User Resources Contact Us Sign In Year in Review Winter Storm Uri In February 2021, Austin experienced a series of winter and ice storms, unofficially referred to as Winter Storm Uri. Winter Storm Uri was an overlapping emergency with overwhelming and cascading statewide impacts to power, water, transportation, communications, and all of our livelihoods. Before the storm arrived, the Austin-Travis County Emergency Operations Center along with City and County departments had already been operating for 11 months on the COVID-19 response. City of Austin and Travis County departments along with community partners had recently ramped up mass vaccination sites; the COVID-19 Alternate Care Site (ACS) at the Austin Convention Center had supported 215 patients; and COVID-19 Protective Lodges, Isolation Facilities, and testing sites operated across Austin-Travis County region. On February 14, 2021, Winter Storm Uri arrived in the Austin area as an additional emergency, taxing already strained resources; and the storm\u2019s impacts escalated quickly. Austin received more than six inches of snow, nearly an inch of ice from freezing rain, and consecutive days of below-freezing temperatures. Statewide supply chains buckled and, at times, stopped functioning, further complicating the procurement of food and potable water. There were 381 water line breaks in City pipelines, and more than 200 apartment complexes lost water due to private plumbing damage.A City-wide boil water notice was issued on February 17 and was in effect for six days. Approximately two weeks later, warmer temperatures returned to the region. The boil water notice was rescinded in stages for residents, then completely lifted on February 23. Power was restored to 100% of Austin Energy customers by February 21. As Austinites gradually recovered, the City and County continued operating food and water distribution sites while demobilizing warming centers and overnight shelters. Eventually, the Palmer Events Center closed to residents on February 26, 2021. After all was said and done, the City and Travis County jointly: Responded to more than 700 traffic accidents Answered more 911 calls than ever before for five consecutive days Assisted hospitals, long-term care facilities, dialysis centers and other community lifelines remain open to care for the community Sheltered more than 1,000 people in dozens of locations Provided thousands of meals to those sheltered Established a medical shelter to help those who needed power for medical equipment or other medical treatments Sustained COVID-19 operations including the Alternate Care Site, multiple Isolation Facilities and Protective Lodges Placed 60 water tanks for bulk water distribution at apartment complexes Distributed 52,000 gallons of bulk water using tanker trucks Installed 65 fire hydrant adapters to provide access to potable water throughout the community Repaired 381 water line breaks in City system in 10 days Responded to more than 1,500 emergency water shutoffs for customers Nationwide, Winter Storm Uri resulted in more than 170 million Americans being placed under winter weather alerts issued by the National Weather Service and caused more than five million people in the United States to experience blackouts, and nearly 18 million Texans experienced a boil water notice. In the State of Texas, Winter Storm Uri created more than $195 billion in damage, making it the costliest natural disaster in Texas history.

Winter Storm Uri was an overlapping emergency with overwhelming and cascading statewide impacts to power, water, transportation, communications, and all of our livelihoods. Before the storm arrived, the Austin-Travis County Emergency Operations Center along with City and County departments had already been operating for 11 months on the COVID-19 response. City of Austin and Travis County departments along with community partners had recently ramped up mass vaccination sites; the COVID-19 Alternate Care Site (ACS) at the Austin Convention Center had supported 215 patients; and COVID-19 Protective Lodges, Isolation Facilities, and testing sites operated across Austin-Travis County region. On February 14, 2021, Winter Storm Uri arrived in the Austin area as an additional emergency, taxing already strained resources; and the storm\u2019s impacts escalated quickly. Austin received more than six inches of snow, nearly an inch of ice from freezing rain, and consecutive days of below-freezing temperatures. Statewide supply chains buckled and, at times, stopped functioning, further complicating the procurement of food and potable water. There were 381 water line breaks in City pipelines, and more than 200 apartment complexes lost water due to private plumbing damage.A City-wide boil water notice was issued on February 17 and was in effect for six days. Approximately two weeks later, warmer temperatures returned to the region. The boil water notice was rescinded in stages for residents, then completely lifted on February 23. Power was restored to 100% of Austin Energy customers by February 21. As Austinites gradually recovered, the City and County continued operating food and water distribution sites while demobilizing warming centers and overnight shelters. Eventually, the Palmer Events Center closed to residents on February 26, 2021. After all was said and done, the City and Travis County jointly: Responded to more than 700 traffic accidents Answered more 911 calls than ever before for five consecutive days Assisted hospitals, long-term care facilities, dialysis centers and other community lifelines remain open to care for the community Sheltered more than 1,000 people in dozens of locations Provided thousands of meals to those sheltered Established a medical shelter to help those who needed power for medical equipment or other medical treatments Sustained COVID-19 operations including the Alternate Care Site, multiple Isolation Facilities and Protective Lodges Placed 60 water tanks for bulk water distribution at apartment complexes Distributed 52,000 gallons of bulk water using tanker trucks Installed 65 fire hydrant adapters to provide access to potable water throughout the community Repaired 381 water line breaks in City system in 10 days Responded to more than 1,500 emergency water shutoffs for customers Nationwide, Winter Storm Uri resulted in more than 170 million Americans being placed under winter weather alerts issued by the National Weather Service and caused more than five million people in the United States to experience blackouts, and nearly 18 million Texans experienced a boil water notice. In the State of Texas, Winter Storm Uri created more than $195 billion in damage, making it the costliest natural disaster in Texas history.

After all was said and done, the City and Travis County jointly: Responded to more than 700 traffic accidents Answered more 911 calls than ever before for five consecutive days Assisted hospitals, long-term care facilities, dialysis centers and other community lifelines remain open to care for the community Sheltered more than 1,000 people in dozens of locations Provided thousands of meals to those sheltered Established a medical shelter to help those who needed power for medical equipment or other medical treatments Sustained COVID-19 operations including the Alternate Care Site, multiple Isolation Facilities and Protective Lodges Placed 60 water tanks for bulk water distribution at apartment complexes Distributed 52,000 gallons of bulk water using tanker trucks Installed 65 fire hydrant adapters to provide access to potable water throughout the community Repaired 381 water line breaks in City system in 10 days Responded to more than 1,500 emergency water shutoffs for customers Nationwide, Winter Storm Uri resulted in more than 170 million Americans being placed under winter weather alerts issued by the National Weather Service and caused more than five million people in the United States to experience blackouts, and nearly 18 million Texans experienced a boil water notice. In the State of Texas, Winter Storm Uri created more than $195 billion in damage, making it the costliest natural disaster in Texas history.

Between 2010 and 2020, Texas GDP rose by an average ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nEconomy\nTexas Statewide Snapshot\nDownload Printable Snapshot (PDF)\nThe Texas Comptroller\u2019s office divides the 268,000 square miles of Texas into 12 economic regions, each with at least one census-defined metropolitan statistical area (MSA), areas with relatively high population densities and close economic integration (Exhibit 1).\nSource: The U.S. Office of Management and Budget delineates Metropolitan Statistical Areas for use in Federal statistical activities.\nThis report examines statewide economic information and trends regarding population, personal income, jobs and wages, and education, as well as economic conditions unique to the state and its regions.\nAccording to the 2020 Census, the state of Texas had a total population of more than 29 million, or 8.8 percent of the nation\u2019s total population. More than half of Texas\u2019 population is concentrated in the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington MSA (26 percent) and Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land MSA (24 percent).\nThe state\u2019s population grew more than twice as fast as the nation\u2019s \u2014 15.9 percent versus 7.4 percent \u2014 between 2010 and 2020. Despite overall growth in the state, 143 of the 254 counties lost population during the past 10 years.\nTexas\u2019 median age was 34.6 years in 2019. College Station-Bryan was the youngest MSA in the state (27.8 years) and the Sherman-Denison MSA was the oldest (39.9 years) (Exhibit 2). A region\u2019s age distribution can reveal specific challenges. A younger area may prioritize education and workforce development, for example, while an older area might face retirement issues and higher health care costs.\nNote: Median age data for the MSAs are from the U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey, 2015-2019. Source: U.S. Census Bureau\nTexas had a median household income of $61,874 in 2019. The state\u2019s income distribution shows 41 percent of households with median income below $50,000 and 42 percent above $75,000 (Exhibit 3).\nSource: Income distribution derived by JobsEQ using data from U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey, 2015 to 2019.\nA strong educational foundation provides a cornerstone for growth and competitiveness in the global economy. Postsecondary education delivers a good return on investments of time and tuition.\nData for 2021 indicates that occupations in the state of Texas requiring at least an associate degree or certificate paid an average of $2,867 more annually than those requiring less than a postsecondary education. Occupations requiring at least a bachelor\u2019s degree paid an average of $44,067 more (Exhibit 4).\nNote: Figures may not sum due to rounding. Sources: JobsEQ; Education requirement category assignments are from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nA postsecondary education offers opportunity for greater job prospects, workplace advancement, higher wages and the development of a richer world view. Texas offers a variety of options for higher educational achievement, including 77 universities, 93 junior and community colleges and 15 health science schools (Exhibit 5).\nSee individual regional reports for more information on higher education institutions within each region.\nSource: Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board\nTexans have access to a variety of hospital services. General hospitals offer a comprehensive range of services and facilities for medical diagnoses and treatments, including surgical services. Special hospitals provide clinical laboratory facilities, diagnostic X-ray facilities, treatment facilities or other definitive medical treatments.\nFor a list of facilities offering services other than hospitals \u2014 such as rural health clinics, community mental health centers and birthing centers \u2014 visit Texas Health and Human Services. Each of the Comptroller\u2019s economic regions offers a variety of hospital options (Exhibit 6).\nNote: State psychiatric hospitals data as of February 2019 Source: Texas Department of Health and Human Services\nAccess to health care facilities adds to the viability of a community. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the share of Texans without health insurance \u2014 18.4 percent in 2019 \u2014 was twice the national average of 9.2 percent.\nIn 2019, the rate of uninsured people in Texas ranged from a low of 16.1 percent in the Capital region to a high of 24.9 percent in the South Texas region (Exhibit 7). (For additional information, see Uninsured Texans, Fiscal Notes, October 2020.)\nNote: Uninsured population includes under 65 (ages 0-64) only. Source: U.S. Census Bureau, SAHIE (Small Area Health Insurance Estimates)\nIn 2020, Texas had a gross domestic product (GDP) of $1.8 trillion, about 8.5 percent of the U.S. GDP. Between 2010 and 2020, Texas GDP rose by an average annual rate of 3.6 percent, more than the national average annual rate of 3.3 percent. In 2020, Texas GDP fell from the previous year by 4.7 percent, more than the national GDP fall of 2.2 percent. (GDP values not adjusted for inflation.) Preliminary data for the first two quarters of 2021, however, suggest a significant economic rebound in many industries and regions.\nThere were 13.2 million people employed in Texas in 2020, a 17.1 percent rise from 2010. U.S. employment, by comparison, rose by 7.8 percent during this period (Exhibit 8).\nSource: JobsEQ using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages\nIn the five-year period between 2015 and 2020, industry employment in Texas rose by 3.3 percent, or about 420,000 jobs. During this period, by comparison, U.S. industry employment fell by 0.5 percent.\nThe state\u2019s largest industries by employment levels are in restaurants, education and health care services. Among these industries, grocery stores, physicians\u2019 offices and postsecondary schools have seen considerable job growth in the past five years (Exhibit 9).\nSource: JobsEQ using data provided by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages\nTexas industries that experienced the largest total job gains between 2015 and 2\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Winter Storm Uri was an overlapping emergency with overwhelming and cascading statewide impacts to power, water, transportation, communications, and all of our livelihoods. Before the storm arrived, the Austin-Travis County Emergency Operations Center along with City and County departments had already been operating for 11 months on the COVID-19 response. City of Austin and Travis County departments along with community partners had recently ramped up mass vaccination sites; the COVID-19 Alternate Care Site (ACS) at the Austin Convention Center had supported 215 patients; and COVID-19 Protective Lodges, Isolation Facilities, and testing sites operated across Austin-Travis County region. On February 14, 2021, Winter Storm Uri arrived in the Austin area as an additional emergency, taxing already strained resources; and the storm\u2019s impacts escalated quickly. Austin received more than six inches of snow, nearly an inch of ice from freezing rain, and consecutive days of below-freezing temperatures. Statewide supply chains buckled and, at times, stopped functioning, further complicating the procurement of food and potable water. There were 381 water line breaks in City pipelines, and more than 200 apartment complexes lost water due to private plumbing damage.A City-wide boil water notice was issued on February 17 and was in effect for six days. Approximately two weeks later, warmer temperatures returned to the region. The boil water notice was rescinded in stages for residents, then completely lifted on February 23. Power was restored to 100% of Austin Energy customers by February 21. As Austinites gradually recovered, the City and County continued operating food and water distribution sites while demobilizing warming centers and overnight shelters. Eventually, the Palmer Events Center closed to residents on February 26, 2021.

What might have been a rare opportunity for residents to experience significant snow accumulation turned catastrophic as power blackouts spanned most of the state from Feb. 15-18. A survey conducted by the University of Houston (UH) Hobby School of Public Affairs in mid-March found that more than two out of three, or 69 percent, of Texans lost power at some point during Feb. 14-20, and almost half, or about 49 percent, had disruptions in water service. The storm contributed to at least 210 deaths, and sources cited by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas estimated the state\u2019s storm-related financial losses would range from $80 billion to $130 billion.\nLike many other things in Texas, energy is big, and much of it also is independent. That independence extends to Texas\u2019 unique place as the only state in the continental United States that is not substantially interconnected with either the Eastern Interconnection or the Western Interconnection (Exhibit 1). The Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC) regulates the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which manages the electricity grid.\nSource: ERCOT\nMore than 26 million Texas customers, or nearly 90 percent of the state\u2019s population, depend on ERCOT for electricity services. ERCOT does not have its own grid infrastructure but instead relies on power generation companies, electricity providers/utilities (i.e., investor-owned and municipally owned providers, electric cooperatives and the river authorities), and transmission and distribution utilities that participate in the wholesale energy market.\nTexas energy is generated from a variety of sources (PDF) with the majority supplied by natural gas, wind and coal \u2014 51 percent, 24.8 percent and 13.4 percent, respectively (Exhibit 2). More than 1,800 active market participants generate, move, buy, sell or use wholesale electricity, and ERCOT works with them to provide individual consumers with electricity. To ensure that the process runs smoothly, ERCOT produces seasonal planning reports to prepare for changes in weather and demand, as well as for potential emergencies based on historical data and planned outages for maintenance as well as other similar purposes.\nSource: ERCOT\nWinter Storm Uri far exceeded the parameters of ERCOT\u2019s seasonal planning. According to the National Weather Service, freezing rain and drizzle coated North and Central Texas as the storm began rolling in on Feb. 11, 2021, causing up to one-half inch of ice accumulation in some locations. Snow later followed on Feb. 14-17, with 5 inches recorded at Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) International Airport and 4.6 inches recorded at Waco Regional Airport. DFW recorded 139 consecutive hours of at or below freezing temperatures, and the Waco airport recorded 205 consecutive hours.\nGov. Greg Abbott issued a state of emergency declaration (PDF) on Feb. 12 due to the severity of the storm. On Feb. 13, some electricity generators began experiencing outages, and on Feb. 14, ERCOT issued a public plea for customers to reduce energy usage after power generation could not be increased to meet demand. As the grid continued to struggle to meet demand, controlled blackouts occurred, and on Feb. 15, ERCOT issued a declaration of emergency. According to a University of Texas at Austin (UT-Austin) Energy Report (PDF), the grid did not normalize until Feb. 19 and narrowly missed a catastrophic failure that potentially could have caused a total blackout throughout the state.\nThe UT-Austin report found that Uri, although not the most severe Texas winter storm on record, caused the most loss of electricity. The report also stated that rolling blackouts were intended to take stress off the power grid but turned into outages that \u2014 in some parts of the state \u2014 lasted several days. According to the report, multiple factors caused those extended blackouts, including that ERCOT underestimated peak demand by nearly 14 percent and weather forecasts misjudged the severity and timing of the storm.\nWhile planned generator outages fell within the appropriate range listed in ERCOT\u2019s seasonal plan, the report found that outages were still high in number. Additionally, energy power generators failed on all fronts, including those powered by natural gas, wind and coal.\nSource: University of Houston, Hobby School of Public Affairs, \u201cThe Winter Storm of 2021\u201d survey\nAs mentioned, 210 people perished because of Winter Storm Uri. According to the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS), most fatalities can be attributed to hypothermia, vehicle crashes, carbon monoxide poisoning and chronic medical conditions complicated by the storm. (DSHS continues to monitor and update this figure as new information becomes available.)\nMany residents found conditions within their homes unbearable, with indoor temperatures at or below freezing. Texas residents who were dependent on electrically powered medical equipment were especially vulnerable. According to the UH survey, of the 69 percent of Texans who lost power during the storm, their average disruption was 42 hours \u2014 31 of those consecutive.

What might have been a rare opportunity for residents to experience significant snow accumulation turned catastrophic as power blackouts spanned most of the state from Feb. 15-18. A survey conducted by the University of Houston (UH) Hobby School of Public Affairs in mid-March found that more than two out of three, or 69 percent, of Texans lost power at some point during Feb. 14-20, and almost half, or about 49 percent, had disruptions in water service. The storm contributed to at least 210 deaths, and sources cited by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas estimated the state\u2019s storm-related financial losses would range from $80 billion to $130 billion.\nLike many other things in Texas, energy is big, and much of it also is independent. That independence extends to Texas\u2019 unique place as the only state in the continental United States that is not substantially interconnected with either the Eastern Interconnection or the Western Interconnection (Exhibit 1). The Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC) regulates the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which manages the electricity grid.\nSource: ERCOT\nMore than 26 million Texas customers, or nearly 90 percent of the state\u2019s population, depend on ERCOT for electricity services. ERCOT does not have its own grid infrastructure but instead relies on power generation companies, electricity providers/utilities (i.e., investor-owned and municipally owned providers, electric cooperatives and the river authorities), and transmission and distribution utilities that participate in the wholesale energy market.\nTexas energy is generated from a variety of sources (PDF) with the majority supplied by natural gas, wind and coal \u2014 51 percent, 24.8 percent and 13.4 percent, respectively (Exhibit 2). More than 1,800 active market participants generate, move, buy, sell or use wholesale electricity, and ERCOT works with them to provide individual consumers with electricity. To ensure that the process runs smoothly, ERCOT produces seasonal planning reports to prepare for changes in weather and demand, as well as for potential emergencies based on historical data and planned outages for maintenance as well as other similar purposes.\nSource: ERCOT\nWinter Storm Uri far exceeded the parameters of ERCOT\u2019s seasonal planning. According to the National Weather Service, freezing rain and drizzle coated North and Central Texas as the storm began rolling in on Feb. 11, 2021, causing up to one-half inch of ice accumulation in some locations. Snow later followed on Feb. 14-17, with 5 inches recorded at Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) International Airport and 4.6 inches recorded at Waco Regional Airport. DFW recorded 139 consecutive hours of at or below freezing temperatures, and the Waco airport recorded 205 consecutive hours.\nGov. Greg Abbott issued a state of emergency declaration (PDF) on Feb. 12 due to the severity of the storm. On Feb. 13, some electricity generators began experiencing outages, and on Feb. 14, ERCOT issued a public plea for customers to reduce energy usage after power generation could not be increased to meet demand. As the grid continued to struggle to meet demand, controlled blackouts occurred, and on Feb. 15, ERCOT issued a declaration of emergency. According to a University of Texas at Austin (UT-Austin) Energy Report (PDF), the grid did not normalize until Feb. 19 and narrowly missed a catastrophic failure that potentially could have caused a total blackout throughout the state.\nThe UT-Austin report found that Uri, although not the most severe Texas winter storm on record, caused the most loss of electricity. The report also stated that rolling blackouts were intended to take stress off the power grid but turned into outages that \u2014 in some parts of the state \u2014 lasted several days. According to the report, multiple factors caused those extended blackouts, including that ERCOT underestimated peak demand by nearly 14 percent and weather forecasts misjudged the severity and timing of the storm.\nWhile planned generator outages fell within the appropriate range listed in ERCOT\u2019s seasonal plan, the report found that outages were still high in number. Additionally, energy power generators failed on all fronts, including those powered by natural gas, wind and coal.\nSource: University of Houston, Hobby School of Public Affairs, \u201cThe Winter Storm of 2021\u201d survey\nAs mentioned, 210 people perished because of Winter Storm Uri. According to the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS), most fatalities can be attributed to hypothermia, vehicle crashes, carbon monoxide poisoning and chronic medical conditions complicated by the storm. (DSHS continues to monitor and update this figure as new information becomes available.)\nMany residents found conditions within their homes unbearable, with indoor temperatures at or below freezing. Texas residents who were dependent on electrically powered medical equipment were especially vulnerable. According to the UH survey, of the 69 percent of Texans who lost power during the storm, their average disruption was 42 hours \u2014 31 of those consecutive. And of the 49 percent of Texans who lost running water, their average disruption was 52 hours (Exhibit 3).\nIn addition to electricity and other utility disruptions, Texas residents experienced a host of negative effects from the winter storm (Exhibit 4).

Meanwhile, 31 percent had water damage to their residences, and of those, only 18 percent believed insurance would likely cover the damage.\nSource: University of Houston, Hobby School of Public Affairs, \u201cThe Winter Storm of 2021\u201d survey\nA recent study by the Texas Real Estate Center at Texas A&M University reported that, in 2019, 11 percent of homeowners in metropolitan areas had n\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Widespread ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nMore than 4 million people in Texas don\u2019t have power, as severe winter weather continues to strain the state\u2019s electric grid.\nWidespread power outages across the state have left millions of Texans without electricity. Some Houston-area residents haven\u2019t had power since Monday morning, as the region enters its second day of below-freezing temperatures.\nHouston Public Media spoke with Dan Cohan, a professor of environmental engineering at Rice University, to learn more about what led to these widespread power outages and if they could have been prevented.\nRead or listen to our interview with him below, edited for length and clarity.\nTo embed this piece of audio in your site, please use this code:\nLarge swaths of Texas have experienced blackouts in the past day. Could you explain what led to these widespread power outages?\nWhat\u2019s happening now is that demand is at record highs as we\u2019re trying to keep our homes warm in the coldest freeze that we\u2019ve had in three decades. Demand for power right now is around 70 gigawatts and power plants in Texas right now can only supply about 45 gigawatts.\nAnd so the system simply isn\u2019t able to handle demand at the level it is, mostly because so many power plants are down right now. People are trying to keep their homes warm. Yet power plants aren\u2019t able to operate the way they normally do both because they weren\u2019t designed to operate well in freezing cold conditions and freezing rain conditions, and because many of the natural gas power plants aren\u2019t able to get enough gas to burn.\nBeyond the current conditions that are limiting operations and driving up demand, is there anything unique about Texas' energy infrastructure that has led us to this moment?\nWhat makes it challenging to handle this is that we don\u2019t have options that might give us more flexibility. We can\u2019t import power from other states because we have so few lines connecting the Texas grid to our neighboring states. When it comes to electricity, what happens in Texas stays in Texas. Because Texas made a decision many decades ago to have its own power grid that wouldn\u2019t connect to the rest of the country, in part because we didn\u2019t want federal rules telling us the way Texas would handle things. And we\u2019re paying the price for that now. Because just when we need the power most, we\u2019re not able to import any of it from our neighboring states.\nFROM THE TEXAS TRIBUNE | Why Does Texas Have Its Own Power Grid?\nTexas relies heavily on natural gas. But what about the other energy sources?\nIn general, the state gets around half of its power from natural gas, and around 20% from wind, around 20% from coal and most of the rest from nuclear. And usually it leads to pretty reliable power because usually wind and solar are able to generate as much as they can, and natural gas adjusts to be able to meet the ups and downs of wind and solar and of when we need power the most.\nWhat\u2019s happening now is what has traditionally been thought of as a viable source of power \u2014 natural gas \u2014 has been struggling. There\u2019s record demand for natural gas, not just from power plants, but also from burning natural gas directly in our homes and offices.\nLooking beyond right here, right now and keeping the bigger picture in mind, what can Texas do to prevent blackouts like this during cold weather weather events in the future?\nThere is no one silver bullet to keep this from happening again, we\u2019re going to need a menu of options. We\u2019re going to need to better insulate (and) weatherize our homes so that we can bring down the demand. We need to think about building some transmission lines to connect our isolated island with other states to be able to trade power. We need to have more storage on the grid \u2014 at the moment, there\u2019s only a very tiny, tiny amount of power that can be stored in batteries.\nAnd we need to be sure we\u2019re maintaining a diversified supply, especially during daytime \u2014 now, solar panels are working great, but we don\u2019t have many of them in the state. Having wind turbines in different parts of the state means that if we have icing conditions in some areas, then wind turbines can be operating well in others. So I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s an all-of-the-above approach, but it\u2019s not going to be a single approach.\nWhat do you think Texas can learn from the historic winter conditions and widespread power outages happening today?\nIf you had asked me a year ago whether to plan for an event like this, I would have thought this was very unlikely. Overall with climate change, warming is happening more strongly in the wintertime. In the 1970s, freezing events \u2014 nights that got below 32 \u00b0F \u2014 happened five times as often as they do today.\nSo most of the time when we\u2019re thinking about resiliency planning, we\u2019re thinking about preparing for the hottest summer afternoons, which are getting hotter than they ever were before.\nSo I think this event is going to tell us that even though we have this warming happening, we still do need to be prepared for winter freeze events and perhaps stronger winter freeze events than we thought seemed possible.\nHave a News Tip?
