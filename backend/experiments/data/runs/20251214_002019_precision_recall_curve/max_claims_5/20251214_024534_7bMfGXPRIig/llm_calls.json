had a bad vacation you fell off the wagon got ran over by the wagon you need to bounce back quickly here is exactly how to do it and the keys but let me talk a little bit more about the benefits of green juice and specifically just drinking that all day long it's going to lower your insulin if you make it right which i'm going to show you in just a few moments of how to make it proper so you don't raise insulin you're going to be lowering it which is an absolute key for getting the fat off the body it's going to help increase your human growth hormone that's right it increases the hormones that build muscle the more muscle you have you crank up the more metabolism a lot of people think you're going to lose a lot of muscle this way but if you do do it right you can actually gain it's going to increase that weight loss it's going to crank up that fat burning machine because you're going to be detoxing so much so many people when they start burning fat the fat contains toxins the toxins are released into the system they're floating around the blood and if they are not eliminated quickly they just take back up into tissue somewhere else and they're restored as fat it's called the rebounding effect so we want to increase weight loss by detoxing the system energy is going up you are putting in so much water so much cleansing so many nutrients when you're doing a juice cleanse like this and then if you do it proper which i'm gonna show you the ingredients in a moment you hit autophagy ding that's like the magic autophagy that is where your body starts recycling if you're not putting in lots of food because you're doing a green juice cleanse you're put your body starts to find other raw materials to make cells out of like old stuff sitting around the scrap pieces of wood and metal viruses microbes it cleans house that's where you want to be if you want long living graceful aging and less disease autophagy is where you want to be it aids the gut it aids the probiotics it gives that digestive system the nutrients that it needs to build up the microbiome which by the way makes up 70 plus percent of your immune system it gives the digestive system a rest some of you have not gone a day your entire life without eating give it a break so much of your energy there isn't a thing you could possibly do on this planet that would expend more energy than your digestive system does on a daily basis not a marathon not anything your digestive system takes a bulk of your energy if you give it a break your energy is going up you're going to feel great so those are the benefits of green juicing what are the keys based on a alternative cancer center that helps people through alternative ways of taking care of their cancer this comes straight from them and it nothing magical nothing proprietary but it helped me to understand this better to keep insulin down and get all the benefits of green juice here's what i used to make it out of number one are green apples granny smiths the red ones have a higher sugar content which is going to spike insulin more we want to keep this lower carbohydrate so we can get into autophagy so make sure the apples are green cucumbers oh you can see the video below for cucumbers their benefits i love cucumbers plus you get a lot of juice out of them so when you are juicing these vegetables it goes much further so i like to add several of those lemons fantastic one of the most nutritious fruits that there is contains a plethora of vitamins all the vitamins you need right there in that lemon celery another one there's a video below for you to check out the extreme effects of celery amazing for your digestive tract especially your stomach and for supporting your liver and detoxing you spinach is next great source of did i spell spinach let me make that an h great source of iron and other vital minerals that you can get in so that goes always kale this is always at the top of the scoring system if you go to the grocery store some grocery stores have this most nutritious food bam kale's always at the top of it broccoli i love broccoli it's so good there's a video below to help you fall in love with broccoli as well i eat this almost every day it is very anti-cancer next is parsley there's another parsley video as well parsley juice is incredible for uh vitamin c antioxidants iron it has more iron than spinach so it's really good for anemia it helps support so many different things parsley is a big one folic acid helps keep homocysteine down lowers your inflammation and then finally you can add in some dandelion which has a very good detox of iron effect so that's what i make the green juice out of you're going to want to get while you're doing this juice cleanse you're going to be taking in water in between the juice you're going to want to get in between 64 and 128 ounces of the juice i would aim for 64s if it's your first time doing it but you can make it out of this one of these if you're following uh will make if you do it proper 32 ounces you'll need to make a couple of them you can use greens powder which already has things like dried parsley dried broccoli dried kale dry spinach try celery dry cucumbers already in there and that greens powder is linked below so i use that in conjunction i just have this for breakfast each morning but you would be just drinking just this i combine the juice with the greens powder to get extra nutrients but it keeps low insulin because it's low carbohydrate that's key with the juice and with the juice powder you can also add in broth or collagen these are very insulin friendly they're going to help your gut during this process they're not going to spike that insulin level and if you like enjoying your tea and your coffee that's great maybe cut back on the milk or the dairy the creamer especially no sugars in there but if you do want a little bit of that so you don't involve like a headache or something wow i'm just not spelling today look at that coffee there we go all right if you want the recipe for this there's a link right below you can click on it and literally we'll send you the recipe we'll send you the benefits and then exactly how to do it day to day what you can drink what you can't drink and you're going to embark on your first one two or three day juice cleanse you can do this every month why get yourself into autophagy get yourself cleaning up all the garbage inside the system amplify your weight loss increase your energy there's so many benefits to it so hopefully i've won you over on the juice cleanse side of things i do it all the time i teach my people to do it all the time and that guide is right below who has the recipes there free resource for you really easy to grab check out the extra videos on these incredible juices start implementing it into your life watch your energy go up and your sickness go down that's how we make health simple subscribe and i'll see you

The reduced antioxidant defence leads to defective elimination of ROS and consequently, delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS). DOMS due to exhaustive or prolonged exercise typically peaks between 24 h and 72 h after exercise results in soreness, inflammation, pain and decreased muscle function. As a result, muscle strength will be reduced progressively and this situation might be detrimental to one\u2019s athletic performance, especially amidst competition season. Therefore, supplementation to improve muscle recovery and sports performance has become a common practice among athletes. However, it is suggested to consume natural-based fruit-derived antioxidants as a more effective and safe nutritional strategy. Fruits containing a high amount of polyphenol protect muscle cells from excessive and harmful ROS due to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant characteristics. To date, there are several expended studies on the consumption of supplements from various antioxidant-rich fruits to provide evidence on their effectiveness, giving better solutions and wider choices of supplementation to the athletes. Therefore, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of nutritional standpoint from previous literature on the effect of fruit juices supplementation on muscle recovery and sports performance.\nKeywords: sports nutrition, antioxidant, fruit juice, delayed-onset muscle soreness, exercise performance\nExhaustive and strenuous exercise has been shown to cause skeletal muscle damage and has been implicated as one of the factors leading to delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS) (1, 2). Strenuous exercise might also increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, leading to an imbalance between antioxidants and ROS (3). The reduced antioxidant defence might affect the elimination of ROS, leading to DOMS (4). DOMS following exercise depends on the type and the severity of exercise and usually peaks between 24 h and 72 h after exercise (5). This period is crucial for athletes during training and competition when there is a limited duration for recovery (2).\nExercise-induced skeletal muscle damage (EIMD) is a common complication of strenuous physical activity. Many studies have found that instantly after strenuous physical activity, biomarkers of skeletal muscle damage such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), myoglobin and creatinine kinase (CK) levels are increased significantly, often more than 5-fold\u2013100-fold (6\u20138). A study by Park et al. (7) observed athletes for a longer duration after a race found that these skeletal muscle damage biomarkers will return to normal after 7 days\u201310 days with proper post-race recovery. However, these damages may affect their performance and limit their potential during events since they only have a limited time allocation for recovery.\nFriden et al. (9) explained the complex mechanism of muscle damage. It was described as a mechanical imbalance between adjacent sarcomere, the breakdown of the sarcotubular system, myofibrillar disruption, cytoskeletal damage and defect on the extracellular myofiber matrix. According to Owens et al. (1), the postulated mechanism can be summarised into two phases. First, the mechanical work that causes the primary damage and second, the inflammatory response processes propagating tissue damage and causing secondary damage. The primary damage due to prolonged mechanical load caused coupling failure of the sarcomere and sarcolemma from eccentric lengthening and excitation-contraction (E\u2013C) (1, 10, 11). The primary phase triggered the cascade of the secondary phase, where there is an influx of Ca2+ into the cytoplasm to maintain homeostasis causes further damage (12\u201314). In this light, the secondary cascade increased the production of ROS and oxidative stress, which causes DOMS (12).\nExercise-induced muscle damages, which cause inflammatory responses, are common among athletes during prolonged training or competition. Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory nutritional supplements are common strategies used to reduce these damages (15). Theoretically, consuming antioxidants will help inhibit ROS formation. This is because antioxidants will bind to metal ions, reduce hydrogen peroxide formation, quench the superoxide and singlet oxygen, and break the chain reaction (3, 16\u201318). This process will improve muscle recovery and performance as it helps reduce inflammatory responses, which cause muscle damages.\nNowadays, various kinds of supplementation for muscle injury, recovery and performance are available in the market. However, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned that these supplements might contain additive and dangerous substances which could cause unwanted side effects. Previous studies have shown that about 38%\u201390% of athletes or the active population consume supplements despite a lack of scientific evidence to support their effectiveness in boosting performance and recovery (19\u201321). Therefore, it is crucial to recognise effective nutritional strategies to encourage faster recovery between intense training periods at pre-season, during 1 day training sessions and between competitions during competition or tournament seasons.\nIn general, antioxidants can be obtained from fruits and vegetables containing polyphenols. Close et al. (22) stated that inflammation and oxidative damage within the muscle causes fatigue and decreased performance due to excess ROS attenuated by the consumption of fruit-derived polyphenols with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Furthermore, the daily consumption of >1000 mg polyphenols for at least 3 days prior to and following exercise or approximately 300 mg polyphenol an hour prior to exercise may ameliorate muscle perfusion, enhancing muscle recovery and performance (17). Therefore, this paper aims to summa\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Vegetable/fruit juices provide polyphenols, oligosaccharides, fiber and nitrate (beet juice), which may induce a prebiotic-like effect. Juice-based diets are becoming popular. However, there is a lack of scientific evidence of their health benefits. It was our hypothesis that changes in the intestinal microbiota induced by a juice-based diet play an important role in their health benefits. Twenty healthy adults consumed only vegetable/fruit juices for 3 days followed by 14 days of customary diet. On day 4 we observed a significant decrease in weight and body mass index (p = 2.0E\u221205), which was maintained until day 17 (p = 3.0E\u221204). On day 4 the proportion of the phylum Firmicutes and Proteobacteria in stool was significantly decreased and Bacteroidetes and Cyanobacteria was increased compared to baseline and was partially reversed on day 17. On day 4 plasma and urine nitric oxide was increased by 244 \u00b1 89% and 450 \u00b1 360%, respectively, and urinary lipid peroxidation marker malondialdehyde was decreased by 32 \u00b1 21% compared to baseline. General well-being score was increased at the end of the study. In summary a 3-day juice-based diet altered the intestinal microbiota associated with weight loss, increase in the vasodilator NO, and decrease in lipid oxidation.\nVegetable/fruit juice-based diets have been very popular recently. However, well designed controlled research studies with clinical outcome measures providing scientific evidence of potential health benefits of juice only diets are limited1. The consumption of vegetable/fruit juice during the abstinence from food provides essential nutrients and improves compliance.\nFruit and vegetables are rich sources of several biologically active components that contribute to general health and decrease the risk of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease2. They are the most ubiquitous source of phenolic compounds3. Polyphenols exert a variety of physiological effects in vitro including antioxidative, immunomodulatory and antimicrobial activities4.\nThe absorption of polyphenols in the small intestine is limited and considerable amounts of these polyphenols can be found in the colon. There the colonic bacteria metabolize polyphenols to smaller compounds, which in turn alter the abundance of bacteria in the intestinal microbiome. In addition, fruit and vegetable are rich in fermentable fiber with prebiotic activity. High fiber intake is associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and some forms of cancer5. Fiber is composed of oligosaccharides, which resist digestion in the small intestine and are transported to the colon where they provide energy for gut bacteria6. Growing evidence is demonstrating the role of the microbiota in the health benefits of dietary fiber consumption6.\nIn the human intestine the gut microbiota is an important contributor to human health and has been implicated in the development of obesity and obesity-related diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease7\u20139. The two most abundant bacterial phyla in humans and in mice are Firmicutes (40\u201360%) and Bacteroidetes (20\u201340%) with lower abundance of Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia10. Recent studies show that dietary interventions with polyphenol rich extracts and foods, including dealcoholized red wine polyphenols, cocoa-derived flavanols, quercetin and grape anthocyanins, modulate the human gut microbiota by decreasing the abundance of Firmicutes and increasing Bifidobacteria, Lactobacillus and Verrucomicrobia11\u201313, which is also a key difference in the gut microbiota found in obese and lean individuals14, 15.\nWe therefore investigated whether the consumption of fruit and vegetable juices (6 bottles daily of mixtures of greens, roots, citrus, lemon, cayenne and vanilla almond) as part of a 3-day juice only program alters the intestinal microbiota in twenty healthy participants. Secondary outcomes of the study were to determine the effect of the 3-day juice based diet on change in weight and body composition and biomarkers of oxidation (urine malondialdehyde) and vasodilation (plasma and urine nitric oxide).\nThirty participants were screened. Twenty-five participants met enrollment criteria and were randomized and completed the 31-day study. Five participants were not able to provide stool samples at either day 4 or 17 and were excluded. All data included in this manuscript includes the twenty participants only (Table 1).\nBaseline characteristics of the study participants.\nAccording to the calorie content provided by the manufacturer the total calorie intake per person per day was 1310 kcal. During the 3-day juice intervention a significant weight loss of 1.7 \u00b1 1.2 kg was observed (p = 2.0E\u221205) (Fig. 1a). After the 2-week follow up period body weight remained decreased (0.91 \u00b1 0.9 kg) compared to baseline weight. Body mass index (BMI) was decreased by 0.6 \u00b1 0.4 after the 3-day juice fast and remained decreased by 0.33 \u00b1 0.3 after the 2 week follow up period (Fig. 1b).\nEffect of juice based diet on body weight (a) and body mass index (b).

However, no studies have evaluated the effects of BJ intake on CrossFit (CF) performance by linking hormonal, metabolic, and mechanical responses. The purpose of this study was to determine the causal physiological association between hormonal, metabolic and mechanical responses, and CF workouts performance after acute BJ intake.\nTwelve well-trained male practitioners undertook a CF workout \ufeffafter drinking 140 mL of BJ (~ 12.8 mmol NO3\u2212) or placebo. The two experimental conditions (BJ or placebo) were administered using a randomized, double-blind, crossover design. The CF workout consisted of repeating the same exercise routine twice: Wall ball (WB) shots plus full back squat (FBS) with 3-min rest (1st routine) or without rest (2nd routine) between the two exercises. A 3-min rest was established between the two exercise routines.\nAn interaction effect was observed in the number of repetitions performed (p = 0.04). The Bonferroni test determined a higher number of repetitions after BJ than placebo intake when a 3-min rest between WB and FBS (1st routine) was established (p = 0.007). An interaction effect was detected in cortisol response (p = 0.04). Cortisol showed a higher increase after BJ compared to placebo intake (76% vs. 36%, respectively). No interaction effect was observed in the testosterone and testosterone/cortisol ratio (p > 0.05). A significant interaction effect was found in oxygen saturation (p = 0.01). A greater oxygen saturation drop was observed in BJ compared to placebo (p < 0.05). An interaction effect was verified in muscular fatigue (p = 0.03) with a higher muscular fatigue being observed with BJ than placebo (p = 0.02).\nBJ intake improved anaerobic performance only after the recovery time between exercises. This increase in performance in the first routine probably generated greater hypoxia in the muscle mass involved, possibly conditioning post-exercise performance. This was observed with a fall in oxygen saturation and in muscle fatigue measured at the end of the CF workout. The greatest perceived changes in cortisol levels after BJ intake could be attributed to the nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway.\nKeywords: Workouts of the day, Testosterone, Cortisol, Testosterone/cortisol ratio, Lactate, Anaerobic performance, Oxygen saturation, Muscular fatigue, Countermovement jump\nCrossFit\u00ae (CF) is considered a strength and conditioning training method characterized by short and high intensity daily sessions called \u201cworkouts of the day\u201d (WOD) [1]. CF is based on three modalities such as metabolic conditioning, gymnastics and weightlifting according \ufeffto the contents of the WOD [2, 3]. Resistance exercises, gymnastic exercises and aerobic modalities (i.e., rowing, running, or cycling) are combined into a single WOD for improving physical condition [4, 5]. The purpose of WOD is to achieve the best time possible or the largest number of rounds and repetitions within a given time domain [6]. Therefore, performance requirements in CF are primarily linked to improvements in anaerobic power and aerobic capacity [7].\nBeetroot juice (BJ) is considered a scientific evidence-based nutritional supplement [8] for improving aerobic and anaerobic performance [9, 10]. This performance enhancement occurs due to the action of the inorganic nitrate (NO3\u2212) present in BJ. Once ingested, approximately 25% of NO3\u2212 existent in the mouth is reduced by NO3\u2212 reductase produced by microorganisms [11] to nitrite (NO2\u2212) [12]. As it reaches the stomach, NO2\u2212 is partially reduced to nitric oxide (NO) by the action of stomach acids and is subsequently absorbed in the gut passing into the bloodstream. In conditions of low oxygen levels, the NO2\u2212\ufeff present in plasma could be reduced to NO [12].\nNO is a gaseous signaling molecule that plays a determining role in various physiological, hemodynamic and metabolic processes [13]. The most relevant functions include an increase in blood flow into the muscle, reduced oxygen uptake (VO2) at a given work rate [14], and blood vessel dilation through mediation by guanylate cyclase [15], among others. Furthermore, NO regulates muscle contraction [16], muscle glucose uptake [17] and mitochondrial biogenesis [18]. All of these functions attributed to NO contribute to optimizing aerobic and anaerobic performance [9, 10].\nThe assumption that BJ improves aerobic and anaerobic performance is widely debated when referring to well-trained athletes [19]. During exercise in an aerobic domain, Lansley et al. observed that acute dietary NO3\u2212 supplementation improved time trial performance in \ufeffcompetitive male cyclists [20]. However, our findings determined that acute BJ intake did not improve time trial performance in well-trained triathletes [19]. In anaerobic assessment, peak power was not different between BJ supplementation and placebo (PL) conditions in recreational, competitive and elite sprint athletes in the Wingate test [21]. Other studies have found increases in peak power levels during the Wingate test [22]. The findings of these studies have led to discrepancies about the possible ergogenic effect of BJ in well-trained athletes.\nIn CF workouts, Kramer et al. demonstrated that chronic dietary NO3\u2212 supplementation did not improve performance in a specific WOD (Grace workout) and a rowing time trial in trained practitioners [23]. To our knowledge, no more studies have investigated the effects of BJ intake on performance of specific WOD [23], therefore, no accurate conclusions can be drawn about the possible ergogenic effect of BJ intake on CF performance.\nOn the other hand, it has been documented that NO is an inter- and intracellular messenger for the regulation of some cellular functions, including variations in hormone secretion [24, 25] for anabolic and catabolic purposes. It has been suggested that NO is one of the main stress-m\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The reduced antioxidant defence leads to defective elimination of ROS and consequently, delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS). DOMS due to exhaustive or prolonged exercise typically peaks between 24 h and 72 h after exercise results in soreness, inflammation, pain and decreased muscle function. As a result, muscle strength will be reduced progressively and this situation might be detrimental to one\u2019s athletic performance, especially amidst competition season. Therefore, supplementation to improve muscle recovery and sports performance has become a common practice among athletes. However, it is suggested to consume natural-based fruit-derived antioxidants as a more effective and safe nutritional strategy. Fruits containing a high amount of polyphenol protect muscle cells from excessive and harmful ROS due to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant characteristics. To date, there are several expended studies on the consumption of supplements from various antioxidant-rich fruits to provide evidence on their effectiveness, giving better solutions and wider choices of supplementation to the athletes. Therefore, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of nutritional standpoint from previous literature on the effect of fruit juices supplementation on muscle recovery and sports performance.\nKeywords: sports nutrition, antioxidant, fruit juice, delayed-onset muscle soreness, exercise performance\nExhaustive and strenuous exercise has been shown to cause skeletal muscle damage and has been implicated as one of the factors leading to delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS) (1, 2). Strenuous exercise might also increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, leading to an imbalance between antioxidants and ROS (3). The reduced antioxidant defence might affect the elimination of ROS, leading to DOMS (4). DOMS following exercise depends on the type and the severity of exercise and usually peaks between 24 h and 72 h after exercise (5). This period is crucial for athletes during training and competition when there is a limited duration for recovery (2).\nExercise-induced skeletal muscle damage (EIMD) is a common complication of strenuous physical activity. Many studies have found that instantly after strenuous physical activity, biomarkers of skeletal muscle damage such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), myoglobin and creatinine kinase (CK) levels are increased significantly, often more than 5-fold\u2013100-fold (6\u20138). A study by Park et al. (7) observed athletes for a longer duration after a race found that these skeletal muscle damage biomarkers will return to normal after 7 days\u201310 days with proper post-race recovery. However, these damages may affect their performance and limit their potential during events since they only have a limited time allocation for recovery.\nFriden et al. (9) explained the complex mechanism of muscle damage. It was described as a mechanical imbalance between adjacent sarcomere, the breakdown of the sarcotubular system, myofibrillar disruption, cytoskeletal damage and defect on the extracellular myofiber matrix. According to Owens et al. (1), the postulated mechanism can be summarised into two phases. First, the mechanical work that causes the primary damage and second, the inflammatory response processes propagating tissue damage and causing secondary damage. The primary damage due to prolonged mechanical load caused coupling failure of the sarcomere and sarcolemma from eccentric lengthening and excitation-contraction (E\u2013C) (1, 10, 11). The primary phase triggered the cascade of the secondary phase, where there is an influx of Ca2+ into the cytoplasm to maintain homeostasis causes further damage (12\u201314). In this light, the secondary cascade increased the production of ROS and oxidative stress, which causes DOMS (12).\nExercise-induced muscle damages, which cause inflammatory responses, are common among athletes during prolonged training or competition. Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory nutritional supplements are common strategies used to reduce these damages (15). Theoretically, consuming antioxidants will help inhibit ROS formation. This is because antioxidants will bind to metal ions, reduce hydrogen peroxide formation, quench the superoxide and singlet oxygen, and break the chain reaction (3, 16\u201318). This process will improve muscle recovery and performance as it helps reduce inflammatory responses, which cause muscle damages.\nNowadays, various kinds of supplementation for muscle injury, recovery and performance are available in the market. However, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned that these supplements might contain additive and dangerous substances which could cause unwanted side effects. Previous studies have shown that about 38%\u201390% of athletes or the active population consume supplements despite a lack of scientific evidence to support their effectiveness in boosting performance and recovery (19\u201321). Therefore, it is crucial to recognise effective nutritional strategies to encourage faster recovery between intense training periods at pre-season, during 1 day training sessions and between competitions during competition or tournament seasons.\nIn general, antioxidants can be obtained from fruits and vegetables containing polyphenols. Close et al. (22) stated that inflammation and oxidative damage within the muscle causes fatigue and decreased performance due to excess ROS attenuated by the consumption of fruit-derived polyphenols with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Furthermore, the daily consumption of >1000 mg polyphenols for at least 3 days prior to and following exercise or approximately 300 mg polyphenol an hour prior to exercise may ameliorate muscle perfusion, enhancing muscle recovery and performance (17). Therefore, this paper aims to summa\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Indeed, while autophagy is always active behind the scenes, it kicks into high gear during times of stress\u2014especially that of starvation.\nWhen cells are starved, they begin to digest and recycle their own proteins and other important molecules to be used for fuel and to regenerate new, healthy cells.\nAs they recycle and renew these valuable parts, they also discard any toxic waste products, pathogens or dead or damaged components.\nThis helps clear the body of toxins and damaged cells, all which contribute to aging, inflammation and increased risk of chronic disease.\nIn fact, autophagy is essential to our survival\u2014cells would not thrive or survive without it.\nEven more so, it\u2019s essential to staying young and healthy. Unfortunately, the autophagy response tends to decrease as we age. The key to longevity may then be in increasing our cells\u2019 autophagic ability.\nOne study to support this found that the cells of long-living individuals (people age 100 and over) showed higher rates of autophagy than younger seniors (at 75 years old) (1).\nSeveral other studies have shown links between autophagy defects, aging and degenerative diseases like Parkinson\u2019s, Alzheimer\u2019s and even cancer (2, 3, 4).\nThe basic idea of autophagy has been known for sometime, but only in the last few decades have researchers been able to figure out exactly how it works.\nIn fact, just in 2016, Japanese Dr. Yoshinori Ohsumi won a Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for his groundbreaking autophagy research.\nIn his studies, Dr. Ohsumi used starvation to activate autophagy. He discovered specific genes involved in the regulation of autophagy.\nThe process itself is quite intricate, but one of its major players is an enzyme known as AMPK.\nAMPK is activated by ADP and AMP, molecules that signal when the energy of a cell is compromised\u2014either from stress or starvation. When this happens, autophagy is activated as well (5).\nEnergy stress and glucose starvation activate AMPK, which triggers autophagy (5).\nThe other major player is mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), which is needed for cell growth and protein synthesis. It also activates insulin receptors.\nHowever, opposite to AMPK, mTOR actually inhibits autophagy. So, you\u2019d want to decrease mTOR, which also happens through nutrient deprivation.\nThe amino acid leucine, which is contained in nearly all proteins, is also a key regulator of autophagy. Namely, when leucine levels in the blood drop, autophagy kicks in (6).\nSimply put, the easiest and fastest way to kick-start autophagy is by depriving your body of nutrients.\nSummary: Autophagy is a natural cleansing process in the body that allows cells to \u201ceat\u201d themselves. When this happens, cells recycle their essential parts to help make new, healthy cells, while ridding of toxic waste products and damaged parts. The life-protecting process kicks into gear when the body is starved or stressed and may be the key to a long, healthy life.\nOne of the most documented ways to activate autophagy is via fasting or intermittent fasting.\nIntermittent fasting (IF) is a more accessible form of fasting that involves set periods of time in which you eat and fast.\nOne of the more popular forms of IF is the Leangains Method (also called 16:8 method), which involves 16 hours of fasting, leaving you with an 8-hour eating window daily (e.g. eating between 12pm and 8pm).\nThis method may be enough to boost autophagy. In general, once you\u2019ve depleted the glycogen stores in your liver, AMPK is activated, mTOR is suppressed and autophagy kicks in (7).\nSome of you may know this as being in the beginning stages of ketosis. For some people, this can start to happen within as little 12-16 hours of fasting.\nBut for maximum autophagy levels, the sweet spot appears to be somewhere between 24 and 48 hours of fasting (8, 9).\nIn general, the research on how often this type of fasting should be done is unclear, and it\u2019s not exactly ideal for most bodies.\nOn top of that, IF can be problematic if done incorrectly and in higher risk individuals. In particular, it can cause hormonal imbalances in women. Read here for more possible risks of following an IF regimen.\nFor the record, while a juice cleanse or detox will severely cut your calorie intake, it will actually inhibit you from boosting your cells\u2019 autophagic activity.\nThis is because you\u2019re still consuming calories and nutrients if you\u2019re drinking juice.\nSummary: The most proven way of activating autophagy is via fasting or intermittent fasting. Some evidence has shown that maximum autophagy levels will occur somewhere between 24 and 48 hours of fasting.\nJust as fasting puts stress on the body in order to induce autophagy, exercise does as well.\nOne study on mice concluded that 95 minutes of exercise induced autophagy in the cerebral cortex of the brain.\nThey also found that mice who spent just 30 minutes on a treadmill showed autophagic activity, which reached a plateau at 80 \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The life-protecting process kicks into gear when the body is starved or stressed and may be the key to a long, healthy life.\nOne of the most documented ways to activate autophagy is via fasting or intermittent fasting.\nIntermittent fasting (IF) is a more accessible form of fasting that involves set periods of time in which you eat and fast.\nOne of the more popular forms of IF is the Leangains Method (also called 16:8 method), which involves 16 hours of fasting, leaving you with an 8-hour eating window daily (e.g. eating between 12pm and 8pm).\nThis method may be enough to boost autophagy. In general, once you\u2019ve depleted the glycogen stores in your liver, AMPK is activated, mTOR is suppressed and autophagy kicks in (7).\nSome of you may know this as being in the beginning stages of ketosis. For some people, this can start to happen within as little 12-16 hours of fasting.\nBut for maximum autophagy levels, the sweet spot appears to be somewhere between 24 and 48 hours of fasting (8, 9).\nIn general, the research on how often this type of fasting should be done is unclear, and it\u2019s not exactly ideal for most bodies.\nOn top of that, IF can be problematic if done incorrectly and in higher risk individuals. In particular, it can cause hormonal imbalances in women. Read here for more possible risks of following an IF regimen.\nFor the record, while a juice cleanse or detox will severely cut your calorie intake, it will actually inhibit you from boosting your cells\u2019 autophagic activity.\nThis is because you\u2019re still consuming calories and nutrients if you\u2019re drinking juice.\nSummary: The most proven way of activating autophagy is via fasting or intermittent fasting. Some evidence has shown that maximum autophagy levels will occur somewhere between 24 and 48 hours of fasting.\nJust as fasting puts stress on the body in order to induce autophagy, exercise does as well.\nOne study on mice concluded that 95 minutes of exercise induced autophagy in the cerebral cortex of the brain.\nThey also found that mice who spent just 30 minutes on a treadmill showed autophagic activity, which reached a plateau at 80 \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",
