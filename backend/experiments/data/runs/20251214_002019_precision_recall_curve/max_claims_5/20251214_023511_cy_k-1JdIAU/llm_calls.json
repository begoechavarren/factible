To help you lose weight and get you that glow! [Music] Hey, beautiful people. It's Melissa from Choosing My Health, where I teach you how to easily transition to a whole food, plant-based lifestyle and thrive. And today we're making three of my favorite veggie juices. I love them because they're an easy way to reboot your metabolism, lose weight and cleanse your body to literally make you glow. I've been juicing for a minute and hands down, it is the easiest way to repair your body in a short span of time. But real talk, your juice gotta taste good. Cause ain't nobody want to be out here on these streets, drinking juice that tastes like dirt. I'm just going to keep it 100. Now, whether you're drinking these for a New Year's push or for three-day juice cleanse you'll find that they don't just taste good, they deliver a whole lot of life-giving nutrients to energize and revitalize your body. When I drink these literally feel like I can fly. Like that's how light I feel. And as always, if you're looking for the full recipe breakdown, I share those on my blog at choosingmyhealth.com, including modifications. I'm going to leave this link and others for you in the description box below. All right, let's get to it. [Music] I call this juice green power. It is loaded with phytonutrients and cleansing power to rid your body of excess weight and make you glow. To begin, we're gonna peel a washed lemon. I love lemons because they flush toxins from your system and purify the blood. Keep the lemon peel because it tastes great in tea and in hot porridge. Next core your washed apples. Apples are great for weight loss because they're high in pectin. Pectin binds with water and limits how much fat your cells can absorb. Isn't that cool?. They also taste great in this next cut all your ingredients into the appropriate size for your juicer. And now we're going to add all our ingredients to the juicer, kale, apple, celery. Cucumber, lime, and ginger. Each of these ingredients is especially formulated to help nourish your body. The celery, cucumber, and apples are vitamin-rich and super hydrating. Our superfood kale is rich in minerals and antioxidants to feed your cells, and lime and ginger increase your blood circulation, all while staying low in calories. You got to love this juice. [Music] Now the Beet Buzzer is my go-to juice to help me reset my body, especially when I'm feeling sluggish and need an energy boost. It's tangy, it's full-bodied and it has a lot of kick. First, peel your washed grapefruit. Grapefruits have one of the highest water contents of any food y'all, about 92% water, and they deliver a whole lot of nutrition with very little calories. We're also going to peel the lemon and cut the rest of our ingredients to an appropriate size for the juicer. Carrots- a juicing staple. Love that it's full of antioxidants including beta carotene, and lutein that are great for the eyes and beets. Beets are chocked full of nutrients and deliver maximum nutrition for your body. We're talking about potassium, magnesium, zinc, selenium. And beets also help you lower your blood pressure if you need help with that, and they give you extra stamina throughout the day. And did you know that beets even improve athletic performance? Professor: Yes, yes, and a yes-i-dy yes. If you'd allow me to just interject here for just a little bit. Beet juice, one to three hours before an athletic event can provide a one to three percent performance boost and give you a serious competitive edge. That's because beats raise nitric oxide levels increase blood flow, improve lung function and strengthen muscle contraction. Now, you know, Then lastly we add jalape\u00f1o. Jalape\u00f1os aren't a typical juice addition for me, but listen, if you can handle a little heat, jalape\u00f1o can boost your metabolism, increase fat burn and reduce your appetite. I will warn you though. It is not for you if you're sensitive to heat. And if you do like heat, very little goes a long way, my friend. So start with like one-fourth of an inch, no seeds please, then taste the juice and add more if you wish. Remember when you use this, you're juicing it. So you're getting the full undiluted effect. Alternatively, if you still want some spice without too much kick, ginger can also achieve the same purpose. [Music] Our last juice is Orange Blast. I call this my sweet treat because it's really flavorful and refreshing and super high in vitamin C, which is going to help the body absorb minerals. It's going to protect the body from chemical toxins and has anti-aging properties. Who doesn't want that? To begin let's peel a pineapple. Pineapple is perfect for detoxing because it contains bromelain, which is a digestive enzyme that will cleanse your colon and it aids digestion. And it's super juicy. Next, we'll cut a red bell pepper in half. Y'all, did you know that a cup of red bell pepper contains nearly three times more vitamin C than an orange? Professor: Oh yeah. I knew. And we're also going to add some ginger and turmeric. Ginger is awesome for circulation and digestion and turmeric, as you probably already know, is incredible for inflammation. And to maximize the benefits of turmeric, you can sprinkle a little black pepper into your drink because it can enhance the curcumin absorption in turmeric by up to 2,000 percent. That's a whole lot! This juice is extraordinarily enjoyable and will boost your immune system all while helping you flush and reset. I love these satisfying, and nutritionally-rich juices. They are perfect for a juice cleanse or for any day you need a boost. And, now if you're looking for more recipes, encouragement, plant-based education. I got you, honey.

Unveiling the Current ...\n\nGoogle Search Snippet:\nApples contain a specific type of fiber known as pectin. Pectin is soluble fiber that has been linked to reduced appetite and improved digestive health. It ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nDietary constituents that suppress appetite, such as dietary fibre and protein, may aid weight loss in obesity. The soluble fermentable dietary fibre pectin promotes satiety and decreases adiposity in diet-induced obese rats but effects of increased protein are unknown. Adult diet-induced obese rats reared on high fat diet (45% energy from fat) were given experimental diets ad libitum for 4 weeks (n = 8/group): high fat control, high fat with high protein (40% energy) as casein or pea protein, or these diets with added 10% w/w pectin. Dietary pectin, but not high protein, decreased food intake by 23% and induced 23% body fat loss, leading to 12% lower final body weight and 44% lower total body fat mass than controls. Plasma concentrations of satiety hormones PYY and total GLP-1 were increased by dietary pectin (168% and 151%, respectively) but not by high protein. Plasma leptin was decreased by 62% on pectin diets and 38% on high pea (but not casein) protein, while plasma insulin was decreased by 44% on pectin, 38% on high pea and 18% on high casein protein diets. Caecal weight and short-chain fatty acid concentrations in the caecum were increased in pectin-fed and high pea protein groups: caecal succinate was increased by pectin (900%), acetate and propionate by pectin (123% and 118%, respectively) and pea protein (147% and 144%, respectively), and butyrate only by pea protein (309%). Caecal branched-chain fatty acid concentrations were decreased by pectin (down 78%) but increased by pea protein (164%). Therefore, the soluble fermentable fibre pectin appeared more effective than high protein for increasing satiety and decreasing caloric intake and adiposity while on high fat diet, and produced a fermentation environment more likely to promote hindgut health. Altogether these data indicate that high fibre may be better than high protein for weight (fat) loss in obesity.\nDietary constituents that are able to enhance satiety and promote weight loss provide an attractive proposition for obesity management. The two macronutrients most commonly associated with increased satiety are dietary fibre and protein, yet there is a lack of publications comparing and defining their efficacy in obese subjects. These biological responses are most usefully and accurately determined in the controlled circumstances of laboratory animal models before advising human dietary intervention trials. Thus, we have recently demonstrated how addition of the soluble fermentable dietary fibre pectin to a high fat diet increases satiety, decreases caloric intake and leads to weight (body fat) loss in diet-induced obese (DIO) rats [1]. In a similar experimental paradigm, we now investigate the individual and interactive effects of supplementary pectin and increased protein of either animal (casein) or plant (pea) origin.\nThere are multiple health benefits for humans with obesity from the dietary incorporation of fibre supplements, including increased satiety and weight loss, but these have not been clearly quantified in the literature [2]. Nonetheless there is good evidence for increased dietary fibre of various types protecting against the development of hyperphagia and obesity in rats and mice fed high fat diets [3\u20136] and our earlier study demonstrated the efficacy of supplementation with the dietary fibre pectin in promoting satiety, hypophagia and weight (fat) loss in rats that were already obese at the start of dietary intervention [1]. The increased intake of dietary fibre in these rodent models is associated with increased secretion of gut satiety hormones, notably PYY and GLP-1 [1, 3, 7, 8].\nHigh protein diets (i.e. with protein providing 30\u201340% food energy) have also emerged over the last decade as a means to achieve weight loss, with increased satiety being the key underlying mechanism [9\u201311]. Increased intake of dietary protein is associated with increased release of the gut satiety hormone PYY in humans and mice, while exogenous PYY reverses the hyperphagic obesity seen in PYY-knockout mice [9]. Furthermore, DIO rats given high protein diet (52% energy from protein) for up to 4 weeks showed decreased body weight and caloric intake and increased circulating PYY concentrations [12].\nHowever, a recent meta-analysis found persistent benefits of high protein for weight loss in humans only in highly controlled feeding studies, with a lack of dietary compliance shown by free-living adults [13]. Moreover, long-term high protein intake is detrimental to renal health, as demonstrated in pigs and rats given diet with 35% energy from protein [14, 15], and is potentially harmful to colonic health, as shown in rats [16] and humans [17]. The harmful colonic effects are largely attributable to changes in the fermentation pattern and metabolites of the gut microbiota when undigested protein reaches the large intestine. Conversely, increased dietary fibre intake promotes a healthy colonic environment, with its cancer-protective effects linked to favourable products of fermentation [18]. Consequently, it has been suggested that inclusion of sufficient fibre or digestion-resistant carbohydrate in high protein weight-loss diets could counteract some of the adverse consequences on gut health [17]. Whereas investigating fermentation products in humans relies on faecal analyses, in the present animal model we are able to measure concentrations of the main fermentation products directly within the large intestine where they are produced.\nThe products of fermentation, the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), are not only critical for colonic health and suppression of inflammation and cancer [19] but they also play a significant role in appetite regulation and energy homeostasis [20]. Amongst other beneficial effects on energy balance, SCFAs have been shown to stimulate the secretion of satiety hormones PYY and GLP-1, and acetate reaching the peripheral circulation can stimulate anorectic\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

People use beet most often for athletic performance ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nAthletes use nutritional supplementation to enhance the effects of training and achieve improvements in their athletic performance. Beetroot juice increases levels of nitric oxide (NO), which serves multiple functions related to increased blood flow, gas exchange, mitochondrial biogenesis and efficiency, and strengthening of muscle contraction. These biomarker improvements indicate that supplementation with beetroot juice could have ergogenic effects on cardiorespiratory endurance that would benefit athletic performance. The aim of this literature review was to determine the effects of beetroot juice supplementation and the combination of beetroot juice with other supplements on cardiorespiratory endurance in athletes. A keyword search of DialNet, MedLine, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases covered publications from 2010 to 2016. After excluding reviews/meta-analyses, animal studies, inaccessible full-text, and studies that did not supplement with beetroot juice and adequately assess cardiorespiratory endurance, 23 articles were selected for analysis. The available results suggest that supplementation with beetroot juice can improve cardiorespiratory endurance in athletes by increasing efficiency, which improves performance at various distances, increases time to exhaustion at submaximal intensities, and may improve the cardiorespiratory performance at anaerobic threshold intensities and maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max). Although the literature shows contradictory data, the findings of other studies lead us to hypothesize that supplementing with beetroot juice could mitigate the ergolytic effects of hypoxia on cardiorespiratory endurance in athletes. It cannot be stated that the combination of beetroot juice with other supplements has a positive or negative effect on cardiorespiratory endurance, but it is possible that the effects of supplementation with beetroot juice can be undermined by interaction with other supplements such as caffeine.\nKeywords: nutrition, sport, exercise, nitric oxide, physical activity\nCardiorespiratory endurance is defined as a health-related component of physical fitness that relates to the ability of the circulatory and respiratory systems to supply fuel during sustained physical activity and to eliminate fatigue products after supplying fuel [1]. Cardiorespiratory endurance is a performance factor in all sports in which adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is resynthesized, mainly by aerobic metabolism or oxidative processes that produce energy. In these sports, the expended effort typically lasts longer than five minutes, primarily depending on the metabolic level of the oxidative processes involved [2]. Factors that limit performance in this type of endurance patterns include maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max), ventilatory thresholds (first and second ventilatory threshold) and energy efficiency or economy [3,4,5].\nIn competitive sports, 0.5%\u20131.5% improvements in performance are considered a critical difference [6]. In order to enhance the effects of training and improve performance, athletes often turn to nutritional supplements [7]. According to the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), adequate selection of nutrients and supplements, adjusting intake according to the exercise performed, is necessary for optimal performance in athletes [8]. However, not all supplements have been shown to produce a positive effect on performance. The Australian Institute of Sport [9], classified supplements to which athletes have access, with the goal of categorizing nutritional supplements based on the level of evidence for impact on an athlete's performance (Table 1). However, the effectiveness of supplements also depends on dosage and type of effort, because the potential ergogenic effect may differ by the specific type of sport [10].\nClassification of nutritional supplements, based on performance effect. Adapted from Australian Institute of Sport [9] and Burke [11].\nBeetroot juice is used as a supplement because of its high inorganic nitrate (NO3\u2212) content, a compound found naturally in vegetables and in processed meats, where it is used as a preservative [12].\nOnce ingested, the NO3\u2212 is reduced to nitrite (NO2\u2212), by anaerobic bacteria in the oral cavity by the action of nitrate reductase enzymes [13] and then to nitric oxide (NO) in the stomach [14]. This physiological mechanism depends on the entero-salivary circulation of inorganic nitrate without involving NOS activity. Once in the acidic stomach, nitrite is instantly decomposed to convert to NO and other nitrogen oxides performing determinant physiological functions (Figure 1). Nitrate and remaining nitrite is absorbed from the intestine into the circulation, which can become bioactive NO in tissues and blood [14] under physiological hypoxia.\nPathway of nitric oxide (NO) production from beetroot juice supplementation. Nitrate (NO3\u2212) is reduced to nitrite (NO2\u2212) by anaerobic bacteria in the oral cavity and then to NO in the stomach. NO3\u2212 and remaining NO2\u2212 are absorbed from the intestine into the circulation, which can become bioactive NO in tissues and blood. NO induces several physiological functions improving skeletal muscle function and, consequently, increasing cardiorespiratory performance.\nNO induces several physiological mechanisms that influences O2 utilization during contraction skeletal muscle. Physiological mechanisms for NO2\u2212 reduction are facilitated by hypoxic conditions, therefore, NO (vasodilator) is produced in those parts of muscle that are consuming or in need of more O2. This mechanism would allow local blood flow to adapt to O2 requirement providing within skeletal muscle an adequate homogeneous distribution. This physiological response could be positive in terms of muscle function, although it would not explain a reduced O2 cost during exercise [15].

The soluble fermentable dietary fibre pectin promotes satiety and decreases adiposity in diet-induced obese rats but effects of increased protein are unknown. Adult diet-induced obese rats reared on high fat diet (45% energy from fat) were given experimental diets ad libitum for 4 weeks (n = 8/group): high fat control, high fat with high protein (40% energy) as casein or pea protein, or these diets with added 10% w/w pectin. Dietary pectin, but not high protein, decreased food intake by 23% and induced 23% body fat loss, leading to 12% lower final body weight and 44% lower total body fat mass than controls. Plasma concentrations of satiety hormones PYY and total GLP-1 were increased by dietary pectin (168% and 151%, respectively) but not by high protein. Plasma leptin was decreased by 62% on pectin diets and 38% on high pea (but not casein) protein, while plasma insulin was decreased by 44% on pectin, 38% on high pea and 18% on high casein protein diets. Caecal weight and short-chain fatty acid concentrations in the caecum were increased in pectin-fed and high pea protein groups: caecal succinate was increased by pectin (900%), acetate and propionate by pectin (123% and 118%, respectively) and pea protein (147% and 144%, respectively), and butyrate only by pea protein (309%). Caecal branched-chain fatty acid concentrations were decreased by pectin (down 78%) but increased by pea protein (164%). Therefore, the soluble fermentable fibre pectin appeared more effective than high protein for increasing satiety and decreasing caloric intake and adiposity while on high fat diet, and produced a fermentation environment more likely to promote hindgut health. Altogether these data indicate that high fibre may be better than high protein for weight (fat) loss in obesity.\nDietary constituents that are able to enhance satiety and promote weight loss provide an attractive proposition for obesity management. The two macronutrients most commonly associated with increased satiety are dietary fibre and protein, yet there is a lack of publications comparing and defining their efficacy in obese subjects. These biological responses are most usefully and accurately determined in the controlled circumstances of laboratory animal models before advising human dietary intervention trials. Thus, we have recently demonstrated how addition of the soluble fermentable dietary fibre pectin to a high fat diet increases satiety, decreases caloric intake and leads to weight (body fat) loss in diet-induced obese (DIO) rats [1]. In a similar experimental paradigm, we now investigate the individual and interactive effects of supplementary pectin and increased protein of either animal (casein) or plant (pea) origin.\nThere are multiple health benefits for humans with obesity from the dietary incorporation of fibre supplements, including increased satiety and weight loss, but these have not been clearly quantified in the literature [2]. Nonetheless there is good evidence for increased dietary fibre of various types protecting against the development of hyperphagia and obesity in rats and mice fed high fat diets [3\u20136] and our earlier study demonstrated the efficacy of supplementation with the dietary fibre pectin in promoting satiety, hypophagia and weight (fat) loss in rats that were already obese at the start of dietary intervention [1]. The increased intake of dietary fibre in these rodent models is associated with increased secretion of gut satiety hormones, notably PYY and GLP-1 [1, 3, 7, 8].\nHigh protein diets (i.e. with protein providing 30\u201340% food energy) have also emerged over the last decade as a means to achieve weight loss, with increased satiety being the key underlying mechanism [9\u201311]. Increased intake of dietary protein is associated with increased release of the gut satiety hormone PYY in humans and mice, while exogenous PYY reverses the hyperphagic obesity seen in PYY-knockout mice [9]. Furthermore, DIO rats given high protein diet (52% energy from protein) for up to 4 weeks showed decreased body weight and caloric intake and increased circulating PYY concentrations [12].\nHowever, a recent meta-analysis found persistent benefits of high protein for weight loss in humans only in highly controlled feeding studies, with a lack of dietary compliance shown by free-living adults [13]. Moreover, long-term high protein intake is detrimental to renal health, as demonstrated in pigs and rats given diet with 35% energy from protein [14, 15], and is potentially harmful to colonic health, as shown in rats [16] and humans [17]. The harmful colonic effects are largely attributable to changes in the fermentation pattern and metabolites of the gut microbiota when undigested protein reaches the large intestine. Conversely, increased dietary fibre intake promotes a healthy colonic environment, with its cancer-protective effects linked to favourable products of fermentation [18]. Consequently, it has been suggested that inclusion of sufficient fibre or digestion-resistant carbohydrate in high protein weight-loss diets could counteract some of the adverse consequences on gut health [17]. Whereas investigating fermentation products in humans relies on faecal analyses, in the present animal model we are able to measure concentrations of the main fermentation products directly within the large intestine where they are produced.\nThe products of fermentation, the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), are not only critical for colonic health and suppression of inflammation and cancer [19] but they also play a significant role in appetite regulation and energy homeostasis [20]. Amongst other beneficial effects on energy balance, SCFAs have been shown to stimulate the secretion of satiety hormones PYY and GLP-1, and acetate reaching the peripheral circulation can stimulate anorectic\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Apart from this effect, what other health benefits does apple pectin have? Does apple pectin have any side effects? In this article, Cigna Smart Health will explain its uses, preparation, and side effects.\nPectin is a soluble fiber commonly found in apples, oranges, and pears. Apple pectin is extracted from apple peels and fibers with broader uses than other fruit pectins. It helps with weight loss, digestion, and even emotional problems.\nApple pectin is a soluble fiber that absorbs and digests by the human body. It also expands and becomes gelatinous when mixed with water. Having pectin before your meal can raise your fullness and reduce your food intake. Besides, apple pectin can also slow down cholesterol absorption from foods, leading to weight loss.\nApart from reducing food intake, apple pectin binds to fats and carbohydrates in your stomach and intestine, decelerating the absorption. Therefore, it can stabilize your blood sugar level and prevent spiking after your meals. For diabetic patients, apple pectin is considered a good choice of supplement.\nApple pectin transforms into butyrate in the human body. Butyrate is well proved for its mood-stabilizing effects. As Dr. George Ku, a Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology specialist, pointed out, people experience depression and insomnia when their bodies lack brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Butyrate can stimulate the brain to produce BDNF to relieve stress, depression, and anxiety.\nApple pectin as a soluble fiber is a relief for constipation and diarrhea. When diarrhea, pectin quickly absorbs water in the intestine and helps form more solid stools. Besides, butyrate, metabolized by apple pectin, also helps maintain colon health and binds to bile acids in your small intestine for easy expulsion. Excreting more bile acids requires your liver to consume more cholesterol to make the acid. As such, cholesterol levels can be lowered and limit gallstones' formation.\nApple pectin can also remove the radioactive particles, heavy metals, and toxins from your body. With a negative charge, pectin creates chelation and attracts positively charged metals. Since the human body cannot absorb apple pectin, it binds heavy metals in the intestine and removes the toxins through bowel movements.\nAlthough you can ingest apple pectin from fresh apples, pectin extracts comparatively have a larger portion and better effects. Apple pectin extracts are commonly seen in powder or capsules. For powdered extract, you are recommended to take one pack by mixing it with your drink 30 minutes before your meal. Most manufacturers suggest a daily dose of between 1,000 mg and 1,400 mg.\nIn most cases, having apple pectin does not incur side effects. However, some may experience diarrhea from drinking too much water. If so, you should adjust your water and pectin intake.\nIf you have the following conditions, you should pay extra attention and think twice before taking apple pectin.\nPlease do not overdose on any medicines and health products. If you are in doubt, please contact your doctor for medical advice.\nThe health benefits of apple pectin are numerous, especially its significant effect on weight loss, but maintaining a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and quitting bad habits are the fundamentals of staying healthy, apart from taking natural supplements.\n\u00a9 Cigna Healthcare 2025 Information provided in this article is intended for health and fitness purposes only and is not intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease (see Terms & Conditions for details).
