    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nIf, for the same work, women make only 77 cents for every dollar a man makes, why don\u2019t businesses hire only women? Wages are the biggest expense for most businesses. So, hiring only women would reduce costs by nearly a quarter \u2013 and that would go right to the bottom line. Don\u2019t businesses want to be profitable? Or, are they just really bad at math? Well, actually, it\u2019s the feminists, celebrities and politicians spreading this wage gap myth who have the math problem. Here\u2019s why: The 77-cents-on-the-dollar statistic is calculated by dividing the median earnings of all women working full-time by the median earnings of all men working full-time. In other words, if the average income of all men is, say, 40,000 dollars a year, and the average annual income of all women is, say, 30,800 dollars, that would mean that women earn 77 cents for every dollar a man earns. 30,800 divided by 40,000 equals .77. But these calculations don\u2019t reveal a gender wage injustice because it doesn\u2019t take into account occupation, position, education or hours worked per week. Even a study by the American Association of University Women, a feminist organization, shows that the actual wage gap shrinks to only 6.6 cents when you factor in different choices men and women make. And the key word here is \u201cchoice.\u201d The small wage gap that does exist has nothing to do with paying women less, let alone with sexism; it has to do with differences in individual career choices that men and women make. In 2009, the U.S. Department of Labor released a paper that examined more than 50 peer-reviewed studies and concluded that the oft-cited 23 percent wage gap \u201cmay be almost entirely the result of individual choices being made by both male and female workers.\u201d Well, let\u2019s look at some of those choices. Georgetown University compiled a list of the five best-paying college majors, and the percentage of men or women majoring in those fields: Number 1 best-paying major: Petroleum Engineering: 87% male Number 2: Pharmaceutical Sciences: 48% male 3: Mathematics and Computer Science: 67% male 4: Aerospace Engineering: 88% male 5: Chemical Engineering: 72% male Notice that women out-represent men in only one of the five top-paying majors \u2013 by only a few percentage points. Now consider the same study\u2019s list of the five worst paying college majors: Number 1: Counseling and Psychology: 74% female Number 2: Early Childhood Education: 97% female 3: Theology and Religious Vocations: 66% male 4: Human Services and Community Organization: 81% female 5: Social Work: 88% female Here, it\u2019s the women who lead in all but one category. Even within the same profession, men and women make different career choices that impact how much money they make. Take nursing, where male nurses on the whole earn 18% more than female nurses. The reason? Male nurses gravitate to the best-paying nursing specialties, they work longer hours, and disproportionately find jobs in cities with the highest compensation. Now, here\u2019s how one expert on nursing compensation, Professor Linda Aiken of the University of Pennsylvania, sums up the data: \u201cCareer choices and educational differences explain most, if not all, the gender gap in nursing.\u201d The Department of Labor paper concluded that once these differences are accounted for across all professions, the unexplained wage gap is somewhere between 4.8 and 7 percent \u2013 almost identical to the 6.6 percentage gap found by the AAUW. But why is there any gap at all? No one knows for sure, as both the AAUW and the Labor Department concede. There are so many variables that drive wages that no single study can cover them all. Few wage gap studies control for variables such as dangerous work environment; men are vastly overrepresented, for example, on oil rigs. And here\u2019s another variable: men are more willing and able to work long hours without advance notice. According to Harvard economist Claudia Goldin, even if two lawyers have the same education, same specialty, and work the same number of hours \u2014 firms pay more to someone who is willing to always be \u201con call\u201d and ready to be in the office when the firm needs them, as opposed to wanting a more regular schedule. This isn\u2019t sexism, it\u2019s just common sense. With more realistic categories and definitions, whatever wage gap remains would certainly narrow to point of vanishing. So it seems that business leaders aren\u2019t bad at math simply because they don\u2019t only hire women. Those who claim that for the same work women earn 77 cents on the dollar compared to men, on the other hand, are not merely bad at math --but at telling the truth.

Furthermore, ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nBy Christina Hoff Sommers\nNovember 04, 2012\nIf you believe women suffer systemic wage discrimination, read the new American Association of University Women (AAUW) study Graduating to a Pay Gap. Bypass the verbal sleights of hand and take a hard look at the numbers. Women are close to achieving the goal of equal pay for equal work. They may be there already.\nHow many times have you heard that, for the same work, women receive 77 cents for every dollar a man earns? This alleged unfairness is the basis for the annual Equal Pay Day observed each year about mid-April to symbolize how far into the current year women have to work to catch up with men\u2019s earnings from the previous year. If the AAUW is right, Equal Pay Day will now have to be moved back to early January.\nThe AAUW has now joined ranks with serious economists who find that when you control for relevant differences between men and women (occupations, college majors, length of time in workplace) the wage gap narrows to the point of vanishing. The 23-cent gap is simply the average difference between the earnings of men and women employed \u201cfull time.\u201d What is important is the \u201cadjusted\u201d wage gap-the figure that controls for all the relevant variables. That is what the new AAUW study explores.\nThe AAUW researchers looked at male and female college graduates one year after graduation. After controlling for several relevant factors (though some were left out, as we shall see), they found that the wage gap narrowed to only 6.6 cents. How much of that is attributable to discrimination? As AAUW spokesperson Lisa Maatz candidly said in an NPR interview, \u201cWe are still trying to figure that out.\u201d\nOne of the best studies on the wage gap was released in 2009 by the U.S. Department of Labor. It examined more than 50 peer-reviewed papers and concluded that the 23-cent wage gap \u201cmay be almost entirely the result of individual choices being made by both male and female workers.\u201d In the past, women\u2019s groups have ignored or explained away such findings.\n\u201cIn fact,\u201d says the National Women\u2019s Law Center, \u201cauthoritative studies show that even when all relevant career and family attributes are taken into account, there is still a significant, unexplained gap in men\u2019s and women\u2019s earnings.\u201d Not quite. What the 2009 Labor Department study showed was that when the proper controls are in place, the unexplained (adjusted) wage gap is somewhere between 4.8 and 7 cents. The new AAUW study is consistent with these findings. But isn\u2019t the unexplained gap, albeit far less than the endlessly publicized 23 cents, still a serious injustice? Shouldn\u2019t we look for ways to compel employers to pay women the extra 5-7 cents? Not before we figure out the cause. The AAUW notes that part of the new 6.6-cent wage-gap may be owed to women\u2019s supposedly inferior negotiating skills \u2014 not unscrupulous employers. Furthermore, the AAUW\u2019s 6.6 cents includes some large legitimate wage differences masked by over-broad occupational categories. For example, its researchers count \u201csocial science\u201d as one college major and report that, among such majors, women earned only 83 percent of what men earned. That may sound unfair\u2026 until you consider that \u201csocial science\u201d includes both economics and sociology majors.\nEconomics majors (66 percent male) have a median income of $70,000; for sociology majors (68 percent female) it is $40,000. Economist Diana Furchtgott-Roth of the Manhattan Institute has pointed to similar incongruities. The AAUW study classifies jobs as diverse as librarian, lawyer, professional athlete, and \u201cmedia occupations\u201d under a single rubric\u2013\u201cother white collar.\u201d Says Furchtgott-Roth: \u201cSo, the AAUW report compares the pay of male lawyers with that of female librarians; of male athletes with that of female communications assistants. That\u2019s not a comparison between people who do the same work.\u201d With more realistic categories and definitions, the remaining 6.6 gap would certainly narrow to just a few cents at most.\n\u201cCould the gender wage gap turn out to be zero? Probably not. The AAUW correctly notes that there is still evidence of residual bias against women in the workplace.\u201d \u2014 Christina Hoff Sommers Could the gender wage gap turn out to be zero? Probably not. The AAUW correctly notes that there is still evidence of residual bias against women in the workplace. However, with the gap approaching a few cents, there is not a lot of room for discrimination. And as economists frequently remind us, if it were really true that an employer could get away with paying Jill less than Jack for the same work, clever entrepreneurs would fire all their male employees, replace them with females, and enjoy a huge market advantage.\nWomen\u2019s groups will counter that even if most of the wage gap can be explained by women\u2019s choices, those choices are not truly free. Women who major in sociology rather than economics, or who choose family-friendly jobs over those that pay better but offer less flexibility, may be compelled by cultural stereotypes. According to the National Organization for Women (NOW), powerful sexist stereotypes \u201csteer\u201d women and men \u201ctoward different education, training, and career paths\u201d and family roles. But are American women really as much in thrall to stereotypes as their feminist protectors claim? Aren\u2019t women capable of understanding their real preferences and making decisions for themselves? NOW needs to show, not dogmatically assert, that women\u2019s choices are not free. And it needs to explain why, by contrast, the life choices it promotes are the authentic ones\u2014 what women truly want, and what will make them happier and more fulfilled.\nIt will not be not easy for the AAUW and its allies to abandon the idea of systemic gender injustice. AAUW officials are trying mightily to sustain the bad-news-for-women narrative. According to \u201cGraduating to a Pay Gap\u201d publicity materials, \u201cThe AAUW today released a new study showing that just one year out of college, millennial women are paid\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The 16.2% wage gap is the narrowest margin reported since BLS began conducting the survey in 1979, when the gap was 37.7%.\nThe BLS survey does not account for factors that contribute to the gender wage gap\u2014such as education, seniority, type of job, and discrimination. Race and ethnic disparities compound gender disparities, BLS data show. In 2023\u2019s fourth quarter, Black women\u2019s median earnings were 89.6% of those for White women and 80.9% of those for White men. Hispanic women\u2019s median earnings were 77.5% of those for White women and 65.2% of those for White men. Both Asian women and men earned more than White men. BLS data also show that job type contributes to the wage gap. Women remain underrepresented in select higher-paying occupations such as management, STEM, and construction.\nAlthough the wage gap has been narrowing steadily, progress has been slow, especially during the past ten years. For example, women earned 83.8% of men\u2019s earnings in 2023, only slightly higher than the 82.0% gap in 2013.\nThis report serves as a reminder that employers should regularly examine pay practices to minimize risk of pay discrimination.\nRELATED CONTENT\nSubscribe to CWC's Updates and Events\nCLICK TO SIGN UP\nSee more\nResources\nOur library of sources helping you understand and manage your workplace requirements and risks.\nData Center\nMetrics and dashboards guiding you to make statistics and research-driven decisions.\nEvents\nLearn and network at events focused on compliance policy, practice, and strategy.\nDiversance Connect\nHelping members find and connect with thousands of outreach and recruitment sources.\n\u00a9 2025 Center for Workplace Compliance (CWC), Washington, DC 20005.

(Nearly all of the 20 most common jobs ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nWomen perform 77% of health care jobs in the United States, but gender inequity within the health care sector harms women's compensation and advancement in health care jobs. Using data from 2003 to 2021 of the Annual Social and Economic Supplement of the Current Population Survey (CPS), we measured women's representation and the gender wage gap in health care jobs by educational level and occupational category. We found, descriptively, that women's representation in health care occupations has increased over time in occupations that require a master's or doctoral/professional degree (eg, physicians, therapists), while men's representation has increased slightly in nursing occupations (eg, registered nurses, LPNs/LVNs, aides, and assistants). The adjusted wage gap between women and men is the largest among workers in high-education health care (eg, physicians, advanced practitioners) but has decreased substantially over the last 20 years, while, descriptively, the gender wage gap has stagnated or grown larger in some lower education occupations. Our policy recommendations include gender equity reviews within health care organizations, prioritizing women managers, and realigning Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement policies to promote greater gender equity within and across health care occupations.\nKeywords: gender inequity, gender wage gap, health care occupations, health care workforce\nThe health care sector is an industry that is dominated by women,1 but gender inequity in pay exists within the health care sector, potentially contributing to lower lifetime earnings for women and deterring women to advance in health care occupations.2,3 However, little is known about how the gender wage gap has changed in the health care workforce over the last decade, especially in relation to changes in the gender composition of the health care workforce. Further, less is known about the gender wage gap at different levels of education, as most research has focused on physicians and nurses, with little examination of patterns across health care occupations. In this paper, we examine how the gender composition and the gender wage gap have changed over the last 2 decades across the full spectrum of the health care workforce.\nIn the general workforce, women's annual earnings were 82.3% of men's in 2020,4 and this gender gap in pay has remained relatively stable in the United States over the past 15 years.5 For women of color, the gap is even wider; Hispanic women earned just 57 cents and Black women earned 64 cents for every $1 earned by White, non-Hispanic men in 2020.6 The wage gap between men and women exists at every level of educational attainment, despite women graduating at higher percentages than men. Today, 36% of young women have a bachelor's or a graduate degree, compared with 28% of young men.7 However, while higher levels of education lead to higher wages in general, more education for women does not necessarily lead to the same wage gains as it does for men.8,9 White women with a college degree earn approximately 74% of their college-educated male peers, while Black and Latina women with a bachelor's degree have the largest gap, at 65%, compared with White, non-Hispanic male peers.4 In other words, education has not effectively reduced the gender wage gap across the economy, even though women are now substantially more educated than men.\nWithin the health care workforce, gender wage gaps in the physician workforce are well established. Male physicians earn higher wages than women physicians across all medical specialties, and medical specialties that are dominated by men pay significantly more as compared with specialties where women are concentrated.10-12 A recent estimate is that female physicians earn approximately 25% less than male physicians (>$2 million over their career),3 and the gap has persisted over decades.12 Among a relatively homogenous group of physician researchers, male gender was associated with higher salary, even after adjustment for specialty, academic rank, leadership positions, publications, and research time.13\nThe gender wage gap persists among other health care workers with high levels of training and education, including nurse practitioners.14,15 A study that looked comprehensively across health care professionals found a gender earnings gap for pharmacists, dentists, physician assistants, and health care executives, and the wage gap fell consistently only for health care executives and pharmacists over time.16 Among nurses, male RNs out-earn female RNs across settings, specialties, and positions, with no narrowing of the pay gap over time.17,18 Finally, few studies have examined the gender wage gap among health care workers with an associate\u2019s degree or less, which represent a large share of health care occupations and are dominated by women. Past research has shown that, among among direct care workers, there is a persistent gender wage gap,19-21 even though very few men hold direct care jobs.\nWhat accounts for the gender wage gap? Across occupations, occupational segregation\u2014where men and women work in specific occupations\u2014accounts for almost half of the overall gender wage gap.8,22,23 Women-dominated occupations pay less, often much less, than male-dominated occupations, when controlling for education, skill level, work experience, and other factors.22,24 Folbre et al25 argue that women-dominated care sector industries like health care are less able then providers of business services to capture value added or extract rents because limited consumer sovereignty, incomplete information regarding quality, and large positive externalities reduce their relative market power. They argue that women's concentration in care services like health care explains a significant proportion of the gender wage gap.25\nWithin health care occupations, one explanation of the gender wage gap is the \u201cglass escalator.\u201d Many health car\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

      "summary": "The evidence presents a mixed picture regarding the claim that male nurses earn 18% more than female nurses. A MarketWatch article supports the claim, indicating that male nurses earn more, while multiple high-reliability sources provide varying statistics on the earnings gap, with some showing a significant difference but not precisely 18%. For instance, Marquette's analysis shows male nurses earning $78,842 compared to $72,567 for female nurses, which is approximately 8% more, while Rutgers-Camden reports a similar gap. Thus, while there is evidence of a pay gap favoring male nurses, the exact figure of 18% is not consistently supported."
