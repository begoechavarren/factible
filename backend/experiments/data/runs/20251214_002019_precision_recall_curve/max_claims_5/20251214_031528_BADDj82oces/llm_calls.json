This study aimed to examine the ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nHIV viral load is at its highest in semen three to four weeks after infection with HIV, according to a study published in the August 20th edition of AIDS. The study also revealed that individuals with late-stage HIV infection also have high viral loads in their semen, and the investigators believe that their findings confirm earlier suggestions that individuals recently infected with HIV as well as those with advanced HIV disease, are particularly infectious and are driving the spread of HIV.\nIt is estimated that 80% of all HIV infections are acquired sexually. The transmission of HIV depends upon the infectiousness of the host and the susceptibility of the sexual partner, and both infectiousness and susceptibility can vary significantly over time.\nInfectiousness can be directly correlated with viral load in blood, and blood viral load can serve as a surrogate marker of shedding of HIV in genital secretions.\nRecent epidemiological research suggests that HIV-positive individuals are at their most infectious soon after they have become infected with the virus, a period often referred to as primary or acute HIV infection. (However a recent US researcher suggested that only 9% of HIV infections were due to individuals with primary infection. Although this model did acknowledge the high viral load present during primary infection, the short duration of primary infection and the small number of sexual contacts per individual during this time limited the contribution of individuals with acute infection to the epidemiology of HIV).\nThere have been no longitudinal studies of the dynamics of genital tract shedding of HIV during primary infection. However, investigators have recently developed a surveillance strategy that allows for the identification of individuals with primary HIV infection even before antibodies to HIV have developed. This has enabled clinicians to detect a significant number of patients with acute HIV infection in the US state of North Carolina, as well as in Malawi, South Africa, and Brazil.\nA team of investigators from North Carolina, San Francisco, and Malawi designed a study which involved men identified with acute HIV infection from a sexually transmitted infections clinic in Malawi. The investigators focused on changes in viral load in both plasma and genital secretions in men with both acute HIV infection and advanced HIV disease.\nThe study was conducted between February 2003 and October 2004 and included men attending the Lilogwe sexually transmitted diseases clinic in Malawi. All the men attending the clinic were screened for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.\nInvestigators estimated the date of primary HIV infection as occurring two weeks before the onset of symptoms of acute antiretroviral syndrome, including fever, headache and joint and muscle pain.\nOf the 951 men who attended the clinic, 370 (39%) were HIV-infected. Of these 16 (2%) were confirmed as having acute HIV infection and 345 (37%), chronic HIV infection. The investigators\u2019 prospective study included all 16 men with acute HIV infection and 25 men with chronic HIV infection. On enrolment, 44% of men with acute HIV, and 52% of those with chronic HIV, had gonorrhoea, NSU or chlamydia.\nOn entry to the study, the median duration of HIV infection for those with acute HIV was estimated to be 28 days. At the initial screening visit, blood viral load was significantly higher in men with acute HIV (1,000,000 copies/ml) than men with chronic HIV (100,000 copies/ml; p = 0.01). One week after enrolment, when semen samples were first obtained, the investigators found that although mean viral load in semen was higher in those with acute HIV infection (25,000 copies/ml), than those with chronic HIV infection (8,000 copies/ml), the difference was not statistically significant.\nThe investigators calculated that viral load peaked in the blood of acutely infected individuals 17 days after infection at well over 1,000,000 copies/ml and in semen four weeks after acquisition of HIV, at approximately 32,000 copies/ml. It then fell back steeply in both blood and semen, and by week ten was a mean of 125,000 copies/ml in blood and 1,000 copies/ml in semen, levels at which it remained stable through 28 weeks of follow-up. These changes in blood and semen viral load between peak levels and nadir levels were statistically significant (p < 0.001).\nFor patients with chronic HIV infection, the investigators found a statistically significant relationship between low CD4 cell count and high viral load in semen (p = 0.01). The investigators believe that this finding supports the theory that patients with advanced HIV disease are more infectious. They also found that each 1 log10 drop in CD4 cell count was associated with a 2 log10 increase in viral load in semen. However, peak viral load in the semen of patients with advanced HIV infection was a mean of 1.4 log10 lower than the peak observed in patients with acute HIV infection, a statistically significant difference (p = 0.0168).\n\u201cIn the current study, we found that HIV in the seminal plasma reached its peak 4 weeks after infection, and that this burst of HIV shedding was almost completely contained by week 10, most likely reflecting the host immune response\u201d, write the investigators.\nThe investigators conclude that their evidence shows that models suggesting the importance of patients with acute and advanced HIV to the continued epidemiology of HIV \u201care likely correct, and help to explain the continued spread of HIV in different kinds of populations.\u201d The investigators add, \u201cthe need for [the] development of prevention intervention(s) focused on patients in the very earliest stages of HIV infection and their exposed and at-risk sexual partners is urgent.\u201d\nPilcher CD et al.

Reverse transcription is an essential step in retroviral replication. This article presents an overview of reverse transcription, briefly describes the structure and function of RT, provides an introduction to some of the cellular and viral factors that can affect reverse transcription, and discusses fidelity and recombination, two processes in which reverse transcription plays an important role. In keeping with the theme of the collection, the emphasis is on HIV-1 and HIV-1 RT.\nMore than half of the drugs currently approved to treat HIV-1 infections are reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Therefore, the continued characterization of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and the process of reverse transcription is vital.\nIt has been 40 years since the discovery of reverse transcriptase (RT) was announced by Howard Temin and David Baltimore, who independently showed that retroviral virions contain an enzymatic activity that can copy RNA into DNA (Baltimore 1970; Mizutani et al. 1970). These experiments provided the crucial proof of Temin\u2019s provirus hypothesis that retroviral infections persist because the RNA genome found in the virions is converted into DNA (Temin 1964). The sequences of the genomes of eukaryotes show how pervasive reverse transcription is in nature; not only do these genomes contain large numbers of endogenous retroviruses, but also a variety of retroposons and reverse-transcribed elements. The discovery in the early 1980s, that AIDS is caused by a human retrovirus, HIV-1, invigorated retroviral research and focused attention on the viral enzymes, which have become the primary target of anti-AIDS drugs. Not surprisingly, the focus of RT research shifted from the RTs of the murine leukemia viruses (MLV) and the avian myeloblastosis virus to HIV-1 RT. The first approved anti-HIV drug, AZT, targets RT, and of the 26 drugs currently approved to treat HIV-1 infections, 14 are RT inhibitors. In addition, RTs (primarily recombinant MLV RTs) have become extremely valuable tools that are widely used in research, in clinical/diagnostic tests, and in biotechnology. We provide here a relatively brief description of the process of reverse transcription, the structure and biochemical functions of RT, some information about how other viral and cellular factors influence reverse transcription, and briefly consider how the reverse transcription process affects both the mutations that arise during the retroviral life cycle and recombination. The focus will be HIV-1 and HIV-1 RT; however, in some cases, we will draw on insights and include information obtained with other retroviruses and other RTs. Although the issues of the inhibition of HIV-1 RT by anti-RT drugs and the mechanisms of drug resistance are of considerable importance, these issues will not be addressed in detail here; the reader is directed to Arts and Hazuda (2011). Given that the literature on RT and reverse transcription is both vast and complex, and the space allowed for this article is limited, we have had to make some difficult choices in what to present, and what to omit, both in terms of the material and the references. For the omissions, we apologize.\nWhen a mature HIV-1 virion infects a susceptible target cell, interactions of the envelope glycoprotein with the coreceptors on the surface of the cell brings about a fusion of the membranes of the host cell and the virion (Wilen et al. 2011). This fusion introduces the contents of the virion into the cytoplasm of the cell, setting the stage for reverse transcription. There are complexities to the early events that accompany reverse transcription in an infected cell, not all of which are well understood, which will be considered later in this article. We will begin by discussing the mechanics of the conversion of the single-stranded RNA genome found in the virion into the linear double-stranded DNA that is the substrate for the integration process. The synthesis of this linear DNA is a reasonably well-understood process; additional details and references can be found in the books Retroviruses (Telesnitsky and Goff 1997) and Reverse Transcriptase (Skalka and Goff 1993). In orthoretroviruses, including HIV-1, reverse transcription takes place in newly infected cells. There is some debate in the literature about whether reverse transcription is initiated in producer cells. Primer tagging experiments suggest that most HIV-1 virions initiate reverse transcription in newly infected cells (Whitcomb et al. 1990); however, there are claims that a small number of nucleotides may be incorporated before the virions initiate infection of target cells (Lori et al. 1992; Trono 1992; Zhu and Cunningham 1993; Huang et al. 1997). Either way, the vast majority of the viral DNA is synthesized in newly infected cells. This is a lifestyle choice; spumaretroviruses and the more distantly related hepadna viruses carry out extensive reverse transcription in producer cells (Summers and Mason 1982; Yu et al. 1996, 1999). Although there are viral and cellular factors that assist in the process of reverse transcription (these will be discussed later) the two enzymatic activities that are necessary and sufficient to carry out reverse transcription are present in RT. These are a DNA polymerase that can copy either a RNA or a DNA template, and an RNase H that degrades RNA if, and only if, it is part of an RNA\u2013DNA duplex.\nLike many other DNA polymerases, RT needs both a primer and a template. Genomic RNA is plus-stranded (the genome and the messages are copied from the same DNA strand), and the primer for the synthesis of the first DNA strand (the minus strand) is a host tRNA whose 3\u2032 end is base paired to a compl\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

New Study Reveals the Steps\n\nGoogle Search Snippet:\nA new study reveals for the first time the steps through which human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) binds to the receptors on the membranes of T cells.\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nHIV is a disease in which the original clinical observations of severe opportunistic infections gave the first clues regarding the underlying pathology, namely that HIV is essentially an infection of the immune system. HIV infects and deletes CD4+ T cells that normally coordinate the adaptive T- and B-cell response to defend against intracellular pathogens. The immune defect is immediate and profound: At the time of acute infection with an AIDS virus, typically more than half of the gut-associated CD4+ T cells are depleted, leaving a damaged immune system to contend with a life-long infection.\nAt the time of acute HIV infection, more than half of the gut-associated CD4+ T cells are depleted, leaving a damaged immune system to contend with a life-long infection.\nThe earliest studies of T-cell function among infected persons revealed aspects of HIV immunopathogenesis that are still not fully understood. Despite initial and persistent damage to CD4+ T cells, and a lack of detectable HIV-specific CD4+ T helper cells (Murray et al. 1984; Lane et al. 1985), the magnitude and breadth of CD8+ T-cell responses to HIV in infected humans were found to be robust, with direct effector function of such a magnitude that it could be readily detected in freshly isolated lymphocytes from peripheral blood and brochoalveolar lavage in persons with AIDS (Plata et al. 1987; Walker et al. 1987; Nixon et al. 1988). HIV was already known to be an immunosuppressive disease, yet these cells were present in such robust quantity that they could be detected by assays measuring the ability of freshly isolated peripheral blood cells to lyse autologous B cells infected with recombinant vaccinia-HIV vectors or peptide pulsed targets (Walker et al. 1987; Nixon et al. 1988). Moreover, CD8+ T cells from infected persons were able to inhibit HIV replication (Walker et al. 1986), clearly showing that these cells were functional at least in vitro, but despite this, persons were progressing to AIDS.\nSubsequent studies using other approaches such as interferon \u03b3 Elispot (Dalod et al. 1999), intracellular cytokine (Maecker et al. 2001), and peptide MHC tetramer assays (Altman et al. 1996) confirmed and quantified these robust CD8+ T-cell responses. Most chronically infected persons target more than a dozen CD8+ epitopes simultaneously (Addo et al. 2003), and in some instances up to 19% of CD8+ T cells are specific for HIV (Richardson 2000; Betts et al. 2001; Papagno et al. 2002), yet control of viremia is not achieved. At the same time, HIV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses were found to be severely impaired, particularly as measured by the ability of these cells to proliferate to viral antigens (Wahren et al. 1987). Thus, from the early studies there was a clear disconnect between the lack of HIV-specific CD4+ T cells and the abundance of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells.\nDespite these conundrums, there were early signs that CD8+ T cells play a role in controlling HIV disease progression. Sequencing of autologous virus from infected persons revealed evidence of immune selection pressure mediated by these responses (Phillips et al. 1991) and an association with the initial decline in peak viremia after acute infection (Borrow et al. 1994; Koup et al. 1994). The development of HLA-class I-peptide tetramers confirmed the presence of robust induction of responses to multiple epitopes (Altman et al. 1996), and as larger numbers of patients were studied, it also became clear that among the strongest associations with disease outcome was the expression of certain HLA class I alleles (Kaslow et al. 1996; Migueles et al. 2000; Gao et al. 2001), implicating class I restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) as a major modulator of disease progression. The relationship between CD8+ T-cell immune function and viral control was shown by experimental depletion of CD8+ T cells in animal models of AIDS virus infection (Jin et al. 1999; Schmitz et al. 1999). As sensitive viral load assays became available, it also became clear that some infected persons were able to control viremia to levels below detection by the most sensitive RNA assays, and that these persons were characterized by robust HIV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses (Rosenberg et al. 1997). However, now a quarter century into the epidemic the precise role of T cells in HIV control, and the precise phenotype, specificity and function of T cells that should be induced with a vaccine, remain unclear. And from the standpoint of vaccine development, it remains controversial as to how much insight is to be gained from the study of persons who have become infected, because by definition these are not protective responses.\nAcute HIV infection is often associated with a transient febrile illness, much like infectious mononucleosis (Ho et al. 1985), which has facilitated the identification of persons in the earliest stages of infection, who are HIV RNA positive but not yet HIV antibody positive. Important justification for the intense study of acute infection is the demonstration that early events predict subsequent disease progression (Mellors et al. 1996; Lyles et al. 2000). Acute infection is associated with a decline in peak viremia from \u223c1\u20135 million viral copies/mL to a steady state of \u223c30,000 copies (Lyles et al. 2000), but peak levels of viremia may be much lower in asymptomatic persons (Fiebig et al. 2003). Very few studies have actually examined CD8+ T-cell responses in the earliest stages of infection (Fiebig stage I and II), but when those studies have been performed it is clear that initial immune responses are very narrowly directed (Goonetilleke et al. 2009) and remain narrowly directed as viral set point is achieved (Dalod et al. 1999; Altfeld et al. 2001). Even when responses to autologous virus are measured, the initial detectable response has usually been to only one to three epitopes (Goonetilleke et al. 2009), even though the autologou\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Figure 7 (Image Series). HIV Reverse Transcription. The key function ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nReverse transcription and integration are the defining features of the Retroviridae; the common name \u201cretrovirus\u201d derives from the fact that these viruses use a virally encoded enzyme, reverse transcriptase (RT), to convert their RNA genomes into DNA. Reverse transcription is an essential step in retroviral replication. This article presents an overview of reverse transcription, briefly describes the structure and function of RT, provides an introduction to some of the cellular and viral factors that can affect reverse transcription, and discusses fidelity and recombination, two processes in which reverse transcription plays an important role. In keeping with the theme of the collection, the emphasis is on HIV-1 and HIV-1 RT.\nMore than half of the drugs currently approved to treat HIV-1 infections are reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Therefore, the continued characterization of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and the process of reverse transcription is vital.\nIt has been 40 years since the discovery of reverse transcriptase (RT) was announced by Howard Temin and David Baltimore, who independently showed that retroviral virions contain an enzymatic activity that can copy RNA into DNA (Baltimore 1970; Mizutani et al. 1970). These experiments provided the crucial proof of Temin\u2019s provirus hypothesis that retroviral infections persist because the RNA genome found in the virions is converted into DNA (Temin 1964). The sequences of the genomes of eukaryotes show how pervasive reverse transcription is in nature; not only do these genomes contain large numbers of endogenous retroviruses, but also a variety of retroposons and reverse-transcribed elements. The discovery in the early 1980s, that AIDS is caused by a human retrovirus, HIV-1, invigorated retroviral research and focused attention on the viral enzymes, which have become the primary target of anti-AIDS drugs. Not surprisingly, the focus of RT research shifted from the RTs of the murine leukemia viruses (MLV) and the avian myeloblastosis virus to HIV-1 RT. The first approved anti-HIV drug, AZT, targets RT, and of the 26 drugs currently approved to treat HIV-1 infections, 14 are RT inhibitors. In addition, RTs (primarily recombinant MLV RTs) have become extremely valuable tools that are widely used in research, in clinical/diagnostic tests, and in biotechnology. We provide here a relatively brief description of the process of reverse transcription, the structure and biochemical functions of RT, some information about how other viral and cellular factors influence reverse transcription, and briefly consider how the reverse transcription process affects both the mutations that arise during the retroviral life cycle and recombination. The focus will be HIV-1 and HIV-1 RT; however, in some cases, we will draw on insights and include information obtained with other retroviruses and other RTs. Although the issues of the inhibition of HIV-1 RT by anti-RT drugs and the mechanisms of drug resistance are of considerable importance, these issues will not be addressed in detail here; the reader is directed to Arts and Hazuda (2011). Given that the literature on RT and reverse transcription is both vast and complex, and the space allowed for this article is limited, we have had to make some difficult choices in what to present, and what to omit, both in terms of the material and the references. For the omissions, we apologize.\nWhen a mature HIV-1 virion infects a susceptible target cell, interactions of the envelope glycoprotein with the coreceptors on the surface of the cell brings about a fusion of the membranes of the host cell and the virion (Wilen et al. 2011). This fusion introduces the contents of the virion into the cytoplasm of the cell, setting the stage for reverse transcription. There are complexities to the early events that accompany reverse transcription in an infected cell, not all of which are well understood, which will be considered later in this article. We will begin by discussing the mechanics of the conversion of the single-stranded RNA genome found in the virion into the linear double-stranded DNA that is the substrate for the integration process. The synthesis of this linear DNA is a reasonably well-understood process; additional details and references can be found in the books Retroviruses (Telesnitsky and Goff 1997) and Reverse Transcriptase (Skalka and Goff 1993). In orthoretroviruses, including HIV-1, reverse transcription takes place in newly infected cells. There is some debate in the literature about whether reverse transcription is initiated in producer cells. Primer tagging experiments suggest that most HIV-1 virions initiate reverse transcription in newly infected cells (Whitcomb et al. 1990); however, there are claims that a small number of nucleotides may be incorporated before the virions initiate infection of target cells (Lori et al. 1992; Trono 1992; Zhu and Cunningham 1993; Huang et al. 1997). Either way, the vast majority of the viral DNA is synthesized in newly infected cells. This is a lifestyle choice; spumaretroviruses and the more distantly related hepadna viruses carry out extensive reverse transcription in producer cells (Summers and Mason 1982; Yu et al. 1996, 1999). Although there are viral and cellular factors that assist in the process of reverse transcription (these will be discussed later) the two enzymatic activities that are necessary and sufficient to carry out reverse transcription are present in RT. These are a DNA polymerase that can copy either a RNA or a DNA template, and an RNase H that degrades RNA if, and only if, it is part of an RNA\u2013DNA duplex.\nLike many other DNA polymerases, RT needs both a primer and a template. Genomic RNA is plus-stranded (the genome and the messages are copied from the same DNA strand), and the primer for the synthesis of the first DNA strand (the minus strand) is a host tRNA whose 3\u2032 end is base paired to a compl\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Despite initial and persistent damage to CD4+ T cells, and a lack of detectable HIV-specific CD4+ T helper cells (Murray et al. 1984; Lane et al. 1985), the magnitude and breadth of CD8+ T-cell responses to HIV in infected humans were found to be robust, with direct effector function of such a magnitude that it could be readily detected in freshly isolated lymphocytes from peripheral blood and brochoalveolar lavage in persons with AIDS (Plata et al. 1987; Walker et al. 1987; Nixon et al. 1988). HIV was already known to be an immunosuppressive disease, yet these cells were present in such robust quantity that they could be detected by assays measuring the ability of freshly isolated peripheral blood cells to lyse autologous B cells infected with recombinant vaccinia-HIV vectors or peptide pulsed targets (Walker et al. 1987; Nixon et al. 1988). Moreover, CD8+ T cells from infected persons were able to inhibit HIV replication (Walker et al. 1986), clearly showing that these cells were functional at least in vitro, but despite this, persons were progressing to AIDS.\nSubsequent studies using other approaches such as interferon \u03b3 Elispot (Dalod et al. 1999), intracellular cytokine (Maecker et al. 2001), and peptide MHC tetramer assays (Altman et al. 1996) confirmed and quantified these robust CD8+ T-cell responses. Most chronically infected persons target more than a dozen CD8+ epitopes simultaneously (Addo et al. 2003), and in some instances up to 19% of CD8+ T cells are specific for HIV (Richardson 2000; Betts et al. 2001; Papagno et al. 2002), yet control of viremia is not achieved. At the same time, HIV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses were found to be severely impaired, particularly as measured by the ability of these cells to proliferate to viral antigens (Wahren et al. 1987). Thus, from the early studies there was a clear disconnect between the lack of HIV-specific CD4+ T cells and the abundance of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells.\nDespite these conundrums, there were early signs that CD8+ T cells play a role in controlling HIV disease progression. Sequencing of autologous virus from infected persons revealed evidence of immune selection pressure mediated by these responses (Phillips et al. 1991) and an association with the initial decline in peak viremia after acute infection (Borrow et al. 1994; Koup et al. 1994). The development of HLA-class I-peptide tetramers confirmed the presence of robust induction of responses to multiple epitopes (Altman et al. 1996), and as larger numbers of patients were studied, it also became clear that among the strongest associations with disease outcome was the expression of certain HLA class I alleles (Kaslow et al. 1996; Migueles et al. 2000; Gao et al. 2001), implicating class I restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) as a major modulator of disease progression. The relationship between CD8+ T-cell immune function and viral control was shown by experimental depletion of CD8+ T cells in animal models of AIDS virus infection (Jin et al. 1999; Schmitz et al. 1999). As sensitive viral load assays became available, it also became clear that some infected persons were able to control viremia to levels below detection by the most sensitive RNA assays, and that these persons were characterized by robust HIV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses (Rosenberg et al. 1997). However, now a quarter century into the epidemic the precise role of T cells in HIV control, and the precise phenotype, specificity and function of T cells that should be induced with a vaccine, remain unclear. And from the standpoint of vaccine development, it remains controversial as to how much insight is to be gained from the study of persons who have become infected, because by definition these are not protective responses.\nAcute HIV infection is often associated with a transient febrile illness, much like infectious mononucleosis (Ho et al. 1985), which has facilitated the identification of persons in the earliest stages of infection, who are HIV RNA positive but not yet HIV antibody positive. Important justification for the intense study of acute infection is the demonstration that early events predict subsequent disease progression (Mellors et al. 1996; Lyles et al. 2000).

View all 16 articles\nEditorial on the Research Topic CD4+ T cells in HIV: a friend or a foe?\nCurrently, there are approximately 38.4 million individuals living with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), of which 36.7 million adults, 1.7 million children (<15 years old), with 54% of cases being females. Since the start of the HIV epidemic, an estimated 84.2 million individuals have been infected with the virus. Tragically, this global health crisis has resulted in the loss of approximately 40 million lives. In 2021 the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated 1.5 million new infections (1). In the early stages of HIV infection, several important events occur within CD4+ T cells, which are a primary target of the virus. CD4+ T cell depletion: HIV infects and destroys CD4+ T cells during the replication process. If left untreated, HIV is the virus kills infected cells directly and indirectly through immune responses that cause cell death. This progressive loss of CD4+ T cells weakens the immune system over time even following antiretroviral treatment (cART) in HIV infected individuals (2). HIV-infected individuals often experience imbalances in CD4+ T cell levels and function. While cART is highly effective in suppressing viral replication and restoring immune function, it may not completely normalize CD4+ T cell counts or fully restore immune balance in all individuals. Some HIV reservoirs, such as latently infected CD4+ T cells or tissues with lower drug penetration, may continue to harbor the virus, and chronic immune activation and inflammation associated with HIV infection can lead to immune exhaustion, where immune cells, including CD4+ T cells, become functionally impaired and less responsive. Despite extensive research, the mechanisms underlying CD4+ T cell loss and dysfunction in HIV infection are not fully understood (3). This edited topic is aimed at shedding lights on the effects of HIV infection on CD4+ T cells, considering their complexity in terms of heterogeneity and tissue distribution (4\u20137).\nThe relationship between HIV infection and CD4+ T cell population is intricate, partly because of their important functions and heterogenous nature. CD4+ T cell responses are central in orchestrating the adaptive immune responses to pathogens (8). Moreover, they are critical in inducing long-lasting vaccine-mediated protection (9). Their main function is to provide help adaptive immune cells; they support antibody production by B cells, affinity maturation, and the selection and they support the generation of long-lasting effective CD8+ T cells, and their antiviral functions. In the last decade, however, our understanding of CD4+ T cell immunology has grown, and it has become clear that CD4+ T cells function extends well beyond the simplistic view of B and T cell help. Many new CD4+ T cell subsets have been discovered (10) with highly specialized and distinct functions and tissue distribution; these subsets include negative regulators of the immune system, T regulatory cells (T-regs), preferentially mucosal CD4+ T cells Th17 and Th9 cells, and B zone resident T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and T follicular regulatory cells (11, 12). All subsets can be defined by specific surface and intracellular markers, including their own unique transcription factor and cytokine profiles. However, many questions remain elusive about their specific role in HIV infection. These subsets are not equally susceptible and each of them may play a unique yet significant role in establishing and maintaining virus reservoirs. Moreover, difference in HIV susceptibility of various CD4 T cells and the loss of CD4+ T cells very early in infection and the imbalance between these subsets is likely to affect the effectiveness of prophylactics vaccines and therapeutic approaches for HIV.\nActivated CD4+ T cells located at mucosal sites are the main targets for HIV infection. Therefore, interventions aimed at reducing the vulnerability of these mucosal targets, particularly in the genital tract which serves as the portal of entry for HIV, could potentially lower the risk of HIV acquisition. Lajoie et al. investigated the effect of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), a well-known and safe systemic anti-inflammatory drug, on T cell activation of the vaginal tract. The study was conducted in a cohort of HIV-uninfected women from Kenya who were given oral ASA at a low dose of 81mg daily for six weeks. Participants were followed for one month to establish a baseline immune activation in the blood and the female genital tract (FGT). Changes to T cell immune activation were measured both systemically and in the mucosal compartment, relative to baseline levels. The authors found that while concentration of ASA in the blood was 58% higher than the level measured in the FGT changes where noticeable in both sites. The blood level of ASA was correlated with lower levels of Th17 cells, CCR5 expressing target CD4+ T cells, and a specialized subset of CD8+ cells called Tc17. Importantly, in the FGT, low- dose ASA resulted in decreased levels of activated CD4+ T cells. Activation was measured by expression of the CCR5, CD95, and CD161+, all of which are markers associate with increased HIV replication (13, 14). This study suggests that ASA may be used to decrease activated FGT CD4+ T cells, thereby potentially reducing the risk of HIV vaginal transmission.\nRecent studies showed that CD4+ T cells expressing the surface receptor glycoprotein CD32 are more susceptible to infection, and virological analyses revealed that CD32+ CD4+ T cells express high levels of inflammatory markers (HIV co-receptor CCR5, and PD-1, CXCR3) and confirming their heightened su\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Reverse transcription is an essential step in retroviral replication. This article presents an overview of reverse transcription, briefly describes the structure and function of RT, provides an introduction to some of the cellular and viral factors that can affect reverse transcription, and discusses fidelity and recombination, two processes in which reverse transcription plays an important role. In keeping with the theme of the collection, the emphasis is on HIV-1 and HIV-1 RT.\nMore than half of the drugs currently approved to treat HIV-1 infections are reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Therefore, the continued characterization of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and the process of reverse transcription is vital.\nIt has been 40 years since the discovery of reverse transcriptase (RT) was announced by Howard Temin and David Baltimore, who independently showed that retroviral virions contain an enzymatic activity that can copy RNA into DNA (Baltimore 1970; Mizutani et al. 1970). These experiments provided the crucial proof of Temin\u2019s provirus hypothesis that retroviral infections persist because the RNA genome found in the virions is converted into DNA (Temin 1964). The sequences of the genomes of eukaryotes show how pervasive reverse transcription is in nature; not only do these genomes contain large numbers of endogenous retroviruses, but also a variety of retroposons and reverse-transcribed elements. The discovery in the early 1980s, that AIDS is caused by a human retrovirus, HIV-1, invigorated retroviral research and focused attention on the viral enzymes, which have become the primary target of anti-AIDS drugs. Not surprisingly, the focus of RT research shifted from the RTs of the murine leukemia viruses (MLV) and the avian myeloblastosis virus to HIV-1 RT. The first approved anti-HIV drug, AZT, targets RT, and of the 26 drugs currently approved to treat HIV-1 infections, 14 are RT inhibitors. In addition, RTs (primarily recombinant MLV RTs) have become extremely valuable tools that are widely used in research, in clinical/diagnostic tests, and in biotechnology. We provide here a relatively brief description of the process of reverse transcription, the structure and biochemical functions of RT, some information about how other viral and cellular factors influence reverse transcription, and briefly consider how the reverse transcription process affects both the mutations that arise during the retroviral life cycle and recombination. The focus will be HIV-1 and HIV-1 RT; however, in some cases, we will draw on insights and include information obtained with other retroviruses and other RTs. Although the issues of the inhibition of HIV-1 RT by anti-RT drugs and the mechanisms of drug resistance are of considerable importance, these issues will not be addressed in detail here; the reader is directed to Arts and Hazuda (2011). Given that the literature on RT and reverse transcription is both vast and complex, and the space allowed for this article is limited, we have had to make some difficult choices in what to present, and what to omit, both in terms of the material and the references. For the omissions, we apologize.\nWhen a mature HIV-1 virion infects a susceptible target cell, interactions of the envelope glycoprotein with the coreceptors on the surface of the cell brings about a fusion of the membranes of the host cell and the virion (Wilen et al. 2011). This fusion introduces the contents of the virion into the cytoplasm of the cell, setting the stage for reverse transcription. There are complexities to the early events that accompany reverse transcription in an infected cell, not all of which are well understood, which will be considered later in this article. We will begin by discussing the mechanics of the conversion of the single-stranded RNA genome found in the virion into the linear double-stranded DNA that is the substrate for the integration process. The synthesis of this linear DNA is a reasonably well-understood process; additional details and references can be found in the books Retroviruses (Telesnitsky and Goff 1997) and Reverse Transcriptase (Skalka and Goff 1993). In orthoretroviruses, including HIV-1, reverse transcription takes place in newly infected cells. There is some debate in the literature about whether reverse transcription is initiated in producer cells. Primer tagging experiments suggest that most HIV-1 virions initiate reverse transcription in newly infected cells (Whitcomb et al. 1990); however, there are claims that a small number of nucleotides may be incorporated before the virions initiate infection of target cells (Lori et al. 1992; Trono 1992; Zhu and Cunningham 1993; Huang et al. 1997). Either way, the vast majority of the viral DNA is synthesized in newly infected cells. This is a lifestyle choice; spumaretroviruses and the more distantly related hepadna viruses carry out extensive reverse transcription in producer cells (Summers and Mason 1982; Yu et al. 1996, 1999). Although there are viral and cellular factors that assist in the process of reverse transcription (these will be discussed later) the two enzymatic activities that are necessary and sufficient to carry out reverse transcription are present in RT. These are a DNA polymerase that can copy either a RNA or a DNA template, and an RNase H that degrades RNA if, and only if, it is part of an RNA\u2013DNA duplex.\nLike many other DNA polymerases, RT needs both a primer and a template. Genomic RNA is plus-stranded (the genome and the messages are copied from the same DNA strand), and the primer for the synthesis of the first DNA strand (the minus strand) is a host tRNA whose 3\u2032 end is base paired to a compl\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",
