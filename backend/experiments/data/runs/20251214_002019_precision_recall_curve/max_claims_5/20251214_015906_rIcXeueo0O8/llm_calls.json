    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\n[Music] [Music] we can think of the atmosphere as a mix of all sorts of gases that surrounds our planet some gases that humans produce can have bad effects on the planet including changing the climate and weather many of the human produced gases are called greenhouse gases these are gases that trap heat and energy from the Sun hi my name is Eric I'm an atmospheric scientist I study climate and greenhouse gases my group's research we really try to understand what's impact in the atmosphere and how that impacts climate Eric and his team study the atmosphere and measure the levels of gases that make it up including greenhouse gases the goals are to better understand where harmful gases are coming from but first they have to collect gases in the atmosphere and to do this they collect samples of air using special tools our instruments are designed to measure the contents of the atmosphere much like weather station would measure wind or rainfall or snowfall our instruments are designed to measure the molecules the components of the air that were actually in these instruments are able to take snapshots of the amount of different gases in the atmosphere at a given time which helps scientists investigate sources of greenhouse gases but since Eric and his team are thinking about the atmosphere they have an interesting approach to collecting their samples we have instrumentation that will put in different places sometimes we'll put it on an airplane and we'll actually fly the airplane around to different regions that were interested in studying the sources will collect air into inlets on the side of the airplane and actually measure it on instruments in the airplane by collecting samples in flight they are able to identify different emission sources that may not be measurable on the ground pretty cool but how does collecting air above the ground tell us about what is happening on the ground we can think about it this bees fly around from flower to flower as they fly pollen gets attached to them if we looked at a bee after a day of flying around we would be able to tell where it had been by looking at the types of pollen it collected Eric and his team are kind of like bees they fly around collecting samples of air and the samples are able to tell us about what is in the air they spend a lot of time flying and collecting samples over farms for this project we very much want to understand the impacts of how we grow our crops on the atmosphere so in order to grow crops you need to plant seeds you might put quite a lot of fertilizer down a lot of the nutrients from fertilizer going to the growing of the crops but not all of the nutrients make their way into the crops and the number of them are lost to the atmosphere by focusing on flying over farms they are able to tell if the fertilizers that farmers are using are good or bad for the atmosphere as we get towards answers we can help inform farmers on what our optimal practices to have them both get their best crop yields but minimize the losses to the atmosphere but their research doesn't just stop at farms they also fly over cities and other areas or fly downwind of cities to try to understand how much is being emitted from all the cars and vehicles in the city how much is coming out of landfills and power plants this research is important because in order to understand how the atmosphere is changing we have to understand what is making it change this research helps us determine where the problem is so we can fix it but don't let just the scientist do it all themselves you can help reduce your impact on the earth too so if one is concerned about what impacts you have on the atmosphere there are different actions that can be taken the most important thing is to simply be cognizant and aware of what you're doing being aware of subtle things even light bulbs on leaving the TV on when you're not watching it all of those small things do add up but there's also simply power being aware of the problem and then collective action that can come out of that do you want to be a scientist like Eric and his team try making your own sampling device [Music]",

But, says atmospheric scientist David Crisp of NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that our society is.\n\u201cThe resilience of Earth\u2019s atmosphere has been proven throughout our planet\u2019s climate history,\u201d said Crisp, science team lead for NASA\u2019s Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite and its successor instrument, OCO-3, which launched to the International Space Station on May 4. \u201cHumans have increased the abundance of carbon dioxide by 45 percent since the beginning of the Industrial Age. That\u2019s making big changes in our environment, but at the same time, it\u2019s not going to lead to a runaway greenhouse effect or something like that. So, our atmosphere will survive, but, as suggested by UCLA professor and Pulitzer-Prize-winning author Jared Diamond, even the most advanced societies can be more fragile than the atmosphere is.\u201d\nChanges to our atmosphere associated with reactive gases (gases that undergo chemical reactions) like ozone and ozone-forming chemicals like nitrous oxides, are relatively short-lived. Carbon dioxide is a different animal, however. Once it\u2019s added to the atmosphere, it hangs around, for a long time: between 300 to 1,000 years. Thus, as humans change the atmosphere by emitting carbon dioxide, those changes will endure on the timescale of many human lives.\nEarth\u2019s atmosphere is associated with many types of cycles, such as the carbon cycle and the water cycle. Crisp says that while our atmosphere is very stable, those cycles aren\u2019t.\n\u201cHumanity\u2019s ability to thrive depends on these other planetary cycles and processes working the way they now do,\u201d he said. \u201cThanks to detailed observations of our planet from space, we\u2019ve seen some changes over the last 30 years that are quite alarming: changes in precipitation patterns, in where and how plants grow, in sea and land ice, in entire ecosystems like tropical rain forests. These changes should attract our attention.\n\u201cOne could say that because the atmosphere is so thin, the activity of 7.7 billion humans can actually make significant changes to the entire system,\u201d he added. \u201cThe composition of Earth\u2019s atmosphere has most certainly been altered. Half of the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations in the last 300 years has occurred since 1980, and one quarter of it since 2000. Methane concentrations have increased 2.5 times since the start of the Industrial Age, with almost all of that occurring since 1980. So changes are coming faster, and they\u2019re becoming more significant.\u201d\nThe concentration of carbon dioxide in Earth\u2019s atmosphere is currently at nearly 412 parts per million (ppm) and rising. This represents a 47 percent increase since the beginning of the Industrial Age, when the concentration was near 280 ppm, and an 11 percent increase since 2000, when it was near 370 ppm. Crisp points out that scientists know the increases in carbon dioxide are caused primarily by human activities because carbon produced by burning fossil fuels has a different ratio of heavy-to-light carbon atoms, so it leaves a distinct \u201cfingerprint\u201d that instruments can measure. A relative decline in the amount of heavy carbon-13 isotopes in the atmosphere points to fossil fuel sources. Burning fossil fuels also depletes oxygen and lowers the ratio of oxygen to nitrogen in the atmosphere.\nOCO-2, launched in July 2014, gathers global measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide with the resolution, precision and coverage needed to understand how this important greenhouse gas \u2014 the principal human-produced driver of climate change \u2014 moves through the Earth system at regional scales, and how it changes over time. From its vantage point in space, OCO-2 makes roughly 100,000 measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide every day.\nCrisp says OCO-2 has already provided new insights into the processes emitting carbon dioxide to the atmosphere and those that are absorbing it.\n\u201cFor as long as we can remember, we\u2019ve talked about Earth\u2019s tropical rainforests as the \u2018lungs\u2019 of our planet,\u201d he said. \u201cMost scientists considered them to be the principal absorber and storage place of carbon dioxide in the Earth system, with Earth\u2019s northern boreal forests playing a secondary role. But that\u2019s not what\u2019s being borne out by our data. We\u2019re seeing that Earth\u2019s tropical regions are a net source of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, at least since 2009. This changes our understanding of things.\u201d\nMeasurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide in the tropics are consistently higher than anything around them, and scientists don\u2019t know why, Crisp said. OCO-2 and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency\u2019s Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) are tracking plant growth in the tropics by observing solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) from chlorophyll in plants. SIF is an indicator of the rate at which plants convert light from the Sun and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into chemical energy.\n\u201cWe\u2019re finding that plant respiration is outstripping their ability to absorb carbon dioxide,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is happening throughout the tropics, and almost all of the time. When we first launched OCO-2, our first two years of on-orbit operations occurred during a strong El Ni\u00f1o event, which had a strong impact on global carbon dioxide emissions. Now we have more than five years of data, and we see that the tropics are always a source (of carbon dioxide), in every season. In fact, the only time we see significant absorption of carbon dioxide in the tropics is in Africa during June, July and August. So that\u2019s half the story.\n\u201cThe other half is also quite interesting,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing northern mid- and high-latitude rainforests becoming better and better absorbers for carbon dioxide over time.

Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA\u2019s rich science and research portfolio.\nIt\u2019s a case of \u201cdarned if you do, darned if don\u2019t.\u201d\nThe global population is projected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050 and we will have to grow a lot more food to feed all of those people. Some might think we would need to use a lot more fertilizer; however, too much fertilizer\u2014nitrogen and phosphorus\u2014can be disastrous to ecosystems, affecting the water, land, air, and biodiversity. The nutrient challenge is to improve fertilizer efficiency to produce more food and energy crops while creating less pollution.\nEach year farmers apply millions of tons of manufactured fertilizer, of which 40-80 percent is lost to the environment. Unfortunately, fertilizer run-off that ends up in lakes, rivers, and estruaries can lead to eutrophication, which is harmful to the ecosystem. Eutrophication is a process where fertilizer stimulates dense marine and fresh water plant growth, which can lead to the death of animal life due to lack of oxygen. Eutrophication is responsible for the 2014 algae bloom in Lake Erie that poisoned drinking water in Toledo, Ohio.\nAt sea, eutrophication may lead to dead zones; there are nearly 500 eutrophic and hypoxic (low oxygen) zones around the world, including 12 in the Chesapeake Bay. Excess fertilizer also plays a role in acidification and is linked to unhealthy bleached coral.\nNIFA is working to monitor and mitigate the effects of excess fertilizer and prevent its occurrence in the first place. One example is NIFA support of the National Atmospheric Deposition Program, which tracks how airborne nitrogen is deposited in the United States and contributes to the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico. The agency provides $500,000 in Hatch Act funding for state agricultural experiment station research and coordinates $1.8 million per year of interagency funding in support of the program\nNIFA has also provided millions of dollars from various grant programs to support fertilizer-related research, education and extension projects. These efforts include improving the efficiency of fertilizers, promoting more effective use of fertilizers, mitigating and reducing strategies, and developing precision technology.\nThe fertilizer industry has recognized the problem. The U.S. Fertilizer Institute and the International Plant Nutrition Institute promotes the use of the \u201c4Rs\u201d as a management practice for farmers. The 4Rs include: right source/kind (match the fertilizer type to crop needs); right time (make nutrients available when the crop needs them); right rate (match the amount of fertilizer to crop needs); and the right place (keep nutrients where crops can use them).\nNitrogen use efficiency is quantifiable; the more efficient the uptake of nitrogen by the plant, the less escapes into the environment. Existing and future NIFA-supported research, coupled with the application of the 4Rs, will help solve the nutrient challenge.\nNIFA invests in and advances agricultural research, education and extension and seeks to make transformative discoveries that solve societal challenges.\nPolicy and Statements\nRelated Sites\nResources\nSign up for Email Updates\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

However, when nitrogen and phosphorus are not fully utilized by the growing plants, they can be lost from the farm fields and negatively impact air and downstream water quality.\nThis excess nitrogen and phosphorus can be washed from farm fields and into waterways during rain events and when snow melts, and can also leach through the soil and into groundwater over time. High levels of nitrogen and phosphorus can cause eutrophication of water bodies. Eutrophication can lead to hypoxia (\u201cdead zones\u201d), causing fish kills and a decrease in aquatic life. Excess nutrients can cause harmful algal blooms (HABs) in freshwater systems, which not only disrupt wildlife but can also produce toxins harmful to humans.\nFertilized soils, as well as livestock operations, are also vulnerable to nutrient losses to the air. Nitrogen can be lost from farm fields in the form of gaseous, nitrogen-based compounds, like ammonia and nitrogen oxides. Ammonia can be harmful to aquatic life if large amounts are deposited from the atmosphere to surface waters. Nitrous oxide is a potent greenhouse gas.\nThere are many ways that farmers can reduce nutrient losses from their operations1, including, but not limited to2.\n1 Reducing Nutrient Loss: Science Shows What WorksExit EPA\u2019s website\n2 USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service Conservation Practice StandardsExit EPA\u2019s website are the best available baseline nationally for implementation of these practices.\n3 Pennsylvania Nutrient Management ProgramExit EPA\u2019s website\n4 Best Management Practices for Agricultural NutrientsExit EPA\u2019s website\n5 Transforming DrainageExit EPA\u2019s website\n6 Conservation Drainage for the MidwestExit EPA\u2019s website\n7 Cover Crops - Keeping Soil in Place While Providing Other BenefitsExit EPA\u2019s website\n8 Research shows perennials would reduce nutrient runoff to the Gulf of America's dead zoneExit EPA\u2019s website\n9 Buffers and Vegetative Filter Strips\n10 Conservation tillageExit EPA\u2019s website\n11 Stream Bank Fencing: Green Banks, Clean StreamsExit EPA\u2019s website\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nThe greenhouse effect is a process that occurs when certain gases in Earth's atmosphere trap the heat from the sun near the surface. This process keeps Earth\u2019s surface warmer than it would be without it. It is similar to how a glass greenhouse keeps plants warm.\nWatch this video to learn about the greenhouse effect!\nAs you might expect from the name, the greenhouse effect works \u2026 like a greenhouse! A greenhouse is a building with glass walls and a glass roof. Greenhouses are used to grow plants, such as tomatoes and tropical flowers. They are often used in places that are colder than a plant's natural environment.\nA greenhouse stays warm inside, even during the winter. In the daytime, sunlight passes through the glass into the greenhouse. It warms the soil, plants, and air inside. At night, the soil and plants slowly release this heat. But the glass traps it in, making the greenhouse warmer than it is outside.\nThe greenhouse effect on Earth works much the same way. Certain gases in the atmosphere trap heat like the glass of a greenhouse. These heat-trapping gases are called greenhouse gases.\nDuring the day, sunlight travels through the atmosphere and warms Earth\u2019s surface. Some of that sunlight bounces, or reflects, off the surface back into space. The rest of it gets absorbed and heats up the surface. At night, Earth's surface cools, releasing this heat back into the air. But some of the heat is trapped by the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. That's what keeps our Earth warm enough to support life as we know it.\nThe greenhouse effect increases on Earth when greenhouse gases are added to the atmosphere. They can be added to the air by a variety of sources.\nScientists have found that over the last 100 years extra greenhouse gases have mainly come from a few sources. These are things like burning coal and oil for energy or burning gasoline to run cars and planes. Other sources, such as erupting volcanoes, have also added some greenhouse gases to the air. But those natural additions have been too small to account for the amount of greenhouse gases we measure in the air today.\nTo reduce the greenhouse effect, greenhouse gases need to be taken out of the atmosphere. Earth has a few ways it does this with plants, soil, and oceans.\nAll plants \u2014 from tall trees to blades of grass, and even the tiny plant-like phytoplankton in the ocean \u2014 take in carbon dioxide and give off oxygen. They do this in a process known as photosynthesis. This is when plants take carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight and change it into food (sugar) and oxygen.\nThe soil and ocean also absorb carbon dioxide from the air. It changes into other things over time through chemical reactions. It can also make the soil and ocean more acidic, which can impact plants and animals. For example, ocean acidification can be harmful to many ocean creatures, such as shellfish and coral, as it weakens their shells and skeletons.\nThe Clouds and the Earth\u2019s Radiant Energy System (CERES) instruments measure changes in the greenhouse effect. They collect data to show how much heat is getting trapped on Earth compared to how much is escaping to space. This data has shown that more heat is getting trapped than what is leaving, which is warming the planet.\nNASA also tracks changes in greenhouse gases over time with satellites. The Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2, or OCO-2, and OCO-3 keep track of carbon dioxide in the air. The Earth Source Mineral Dust Source Investigation, or EMIT, satellite can track methane. Other satellites, like the Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem, or PACE, measure changes in the ocean.\nAqua\u2019s main goal is to improve our understanding of Earth's water cycle.\nOCO-2 is the first spacecraft dedicated to studying carbon dioxide in Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\nOCO-3 is a near replica of OCO-2 and measures carbon dioxide in our atmosphere to help us understand the relationship between plants and carbon dioxide.\nThis mission studies phytoplankton (a type of tiny algae), ocean color and measures atmospheric particles and clouds.\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Credit: NOAA Climate Program Office, Graphic by Anna Eshelman\nGreenhouse gases (GHGs) are a category of gases that absorb heat energy emitted from the planet's surface and they remain in Earth's atmosphere for a long time (from decades to centuries). Though they make up only a small portion of the atmosphere (less than 1% of all air molecules), GHGs absorb a significant amount of heat energy and re-radiate some of it back toward the surface. They're called \"greenhouse gases\" because they trap heat near the Earth's surface in a manner somewhat similar to how a greenhouse allows in the sun\u2019s rays and then holds in the resulting heat.\nLearn more at the NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory\nBy adding more GHGs, like carbon dioxide and methane, to the atmosphere, humans are causing average global temperature to rise at an unprecedented rate. Earth has warmed by an average of 0.11\u00b0F (0.06\u00b0C) per decade since 1850, or about 2\u00b0F (1.1\u00b0C) in total. If yearly emissions continue to increase as rapidly as they have since 2000, climate models project that by the end of this century global temperature will be between 2.7\u00b0F (1.5\u00b0C) warmer than the 1901-1960 average, and possibly as much as 7.9\u00b0F (4.4\u00b0C) warmer, which would be catastrophic to human civilization.\nScientists warn that if our world warms by 2.7\u00b0F (1.5\u00b0C) or more above pre-industrial temperatures, then there will very likely be harmful impacts to human health and well-being as well as human-built environments and natural systems.\nDownload the Climate Change 2023 Synthesis Report PDF\nThe most basic reason is that fossil fuels\u2014the equivalent of millions of years of plant growth\u2014are the only source of carbon dioxide large enough to raise atmospheric carbon dioxide amounts as high and as quickly as they have risen.\nNOAA develops State of the Science Fact Sheets about key research areas which may be of high interest to the public, and where there may be a diversity of science views within NOAA.

This process keeps Earth\u2019s surface warmer than it would be without it. It is similar to how a glass greenhouse keeps plants warm.\nWatch this video to learn about the greenhouse effect!\nAs you might expect from the name, the greenhouse effect works \u2026 like a greenhouse! A greenhouse is a building with glass walls and a glass roof. Greenhouses are used to grow plants, such as tomatoes and tropical flowers. They are often used in places that are colder than a plant's natural environment.\nA greenhouse stays warm inside, even during the winter. In the daytime, sunlight passes through the glass into the greenhouse. It warms the soil, plants, and air inside. At night, the soil and plants slowly release this heat. But the glass traps it in, making the greenhouse warmer than it is outside.\nThe greenhouse effect on Earth works much the same way. Certain gases in the atmosphere trap heat like the glass of a greenhouse. These heat-trapping gases are called greenhouse gases.\nDuring the day, sunlight travels through the atmosphere and warms Earth\u2019s surface. Some of that sunlight bounces, or reflects, off the surface back into space. The rest of it gets absorbed and heats up the surface. At night, Earth's surface cools, releasing this heat back into the air. But some of the heat is trapped by the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. That's what keeps our Earth warm enough to support life as we know it.\nThe greenhouse effect increases on Earth when greenhouse gases are added to the atmosphere. They can be added to the air by a variety of sources.\nScientists have found that over the last 100 years extra greenhouse gases have mainly come from a few sources. These are things like burning coal and oil for energy or burning gasoline to run cars and planes. Other sources, such as erupting volcanoes, have also added some greenhouse gases to the air. But those natural additions have been too small to account for the amount of greenhouse gases we measure in the air today.\nTo reduce the greenhouse effect, greenhouse gases need to be taken out of the atmosphere. Earth has a few ways it does this with plants, soil, and oceans.\nAll plants \u2014 from tall trees to blades of grass, and even the tiny plant-like phytoplankton in the ocean \u2014 take in carbon dioxide and give off oxygen. They do this in a process known as photosynthesis. This is when plants take carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight and change it into food (sugar) and oxygen.\nThe soil and ocean also absorb carbon dioxide from the air. It changes into other things over time through chemical reactions. It can also make the soil and ocean more acidic, which can impact plants and animals. For example, ocean acidification can be harmful to many ocean creatures, such as shellfish and coral, as it weakens their shells and skeletons.\nThe Clouds and the Earth\u2019s Radiant Energy System (CERES) instruments measure changes in the greenhouse effect. They collect data to show how much heat is getting trapped on Earth compared to how much is escaping to space. This data has shown that more heat is getting trapped than what is leaving, which is warming the planet.\nNASA also tracks changes in greenhouse gases over time with satellites. The Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2, or OCO-2, and OCO-3 keep track of carbon dioxide in the air. The Earth Source Mineral Dust Source Investigation, or EMIT, satellite can track methane.

Life on Earth is possible thanks to greenhouse effect. Without it, temperature on Earth\u2019s surface would be around -19\u00b0C, instead of the current average of 14\u00b0C. Greenhouse effect is produced by greenhouse gasses (GHG) like water vapor, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxides (NxO) and ozone (O3). GHG have natural and anthropogenic origin. However, increasing GHG provokes extreme climate changes such as floods, droughts and heat, which induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress in plants. The main sources of ROS in stress conditions are: augmented photorespiration, NADPH oxidase (NOX) activity, \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids and disorders in the electron transport chains of mitochondria and chloroplasts. Plants have developed an antioxidant machinery that includes the activity of ROS detoxifying enzymes [e.g., superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and peroxiredoxin (PRX)], as well as antioxidant molecules such as ascorbic acid (ASC) and glutathione (GSH) that are present in almost all subcellular compartments. CO2 and NO help to maintain the redox equilibrium. Higher CO2 concentrations increase the photosynthesis through the CO2-unsaturated Rubisco activity. But Rubisco photorespiration and NOX activities could also augment ROS production. NO regulate the ROS concentration preserving balance among ROS, GSH, GSNO, and ASC. When ROS are in huge concentration, NO induces transcription and activity of SOD, APX, and CAT. However, when ROS are necessary (e.g., for pathogen resistance), NO may inhibit APX, CAT, and NOX activity by the S-nitrosylation of cysteine residues, favoring cell death. NO also regulates GSH concentration in several ways. NO may react with GSH to form GSNO, the NO cell reservoir and main source of S-nitrosylation. GSNO could be decomposed by the GSNO reductase (GSNOR) to GSSG which, in turn, is reduced to GSH by glutathione reductase (GR). GSNOR may be also inhibited by S-nitrosylation and GR activated by NO. In conclusion, NO plays a central role in the tolerance of plants to climate change.\nKeywords: climate change, greenhouse effect, oxidative stress, nitric oxide, plants\nLife on Earth, as it is, relies on the natural atmospheric greenhouse effect. This is the result of a process in which a planet\u2019s atmosphere traps the sun radiation and warms the planet\u2019s surface.\nGreenhouse effect occurs in the troposphere (the lower atmosphere layer), where life and weather occur. In the absence of greenhouse effect, the average temperature on Earth\u2019s surface is estimated around -19\u00b0C, instead of the current average of 14\u00b0C (Le Treut et al., 2007). Greenhouse effect is produced by greenhouse gasses (GHG). GHG are those gaseous constituents of the atmosphere that absorb and emit radiation in the thermal infrared range (IPCC, 2014). Traces of GHG, both natural and anthropogenic, are present in the troposphere. The most abundant GHG in increasing order of importance are: water vapor, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxides (NxO) and ozone (O3) (Kiehl and Trenberth, 1997). GHG percentages vary daily, seasonally, and annually.\nWater is present in the troposphere both as vapor and clouds. Water vapor was reported by Tyndal in 1861 as the most important gaseous absorber of variations in infrared radiation (cited in Held and Souden, 2000). Further accurate calculation estimate that water vapor and clouds are responsible for 49 and 25%, respectively, of the long wave (thermal) absorption (Schmidt et al., 2010). However, atmospheric lifetime of water vapor is short (days) compared to other GHG as CO2 (years) (IPCC, 2014).\nWater vapor concentrations are not directly influenced by anthropogenic activity and vary regionally. However, human activity increases global temperatures and water vapor formation indirectly, amplifying the warming in a process known as water vapor feedback (Soden et al., 2005).\nCarbon dioxide is responsible for 20% of the thermal absorption (Schmidt et al., 2010).\nNatural sources of CO2 include organic decomposition, ocean release and respiration. Anthropogenic CO2 sources are derived from activities such as cement manufacturing, deforestation, fossil fuels combustion such as coal, oil and natural gas, etc. Surprisingly, 24% of direct CO2 emission comes from agriculture, forestry and other land use, and 21% comes from industry (IPCC, 2014).\nAtmospheric CO2 concentrations climbed up dramatically in the past two centuries, rising from around 270 \u03bcmol.mol-1 in 1750 to present concentrations higher than 385 \u03bcmol.mol-1 (Mittler and Blumwald, 2010; IPCC, 2014). Around 50% of cumulative anthropogenic CO2 emissions between 1750 and 2010 have taken place since the 1970s (IPCC, 2014). It is calculated that the temperature rise produced by high CO2 concentrations, plus the water positive feedback, would increase by 3\u20135\u00b0C the global mean surface temperature in 2100 (IPCC, 2014).\nMethane (CH4) is the main atmospheric organic trace gas. CH4 is the primary component of natural gas, a worldwide fuel source. Significant emissions of CH4 result from cattle farming and agriculture, but mainly as a consequence of fossil fuel use. Concentrations of CH4 were multiplied by two since the pre-industrial era. The present worldwide-averaged concentration is of 1.8 \u03bcmol.mol-1 (IPCC, 2014).\nAlthough its concentration represents only 0.5% that of CO2, concerns arise regarding a jump in CH4 atmospheric release. Indeed, it is 30 times more powerful than CO2 as GHG (IPCC, 2014). CH4 generates O3 (see below), and along with carbon monoxide (CO), contributes to control the amount of OH in the troposphere (Wuebbles and Hayhoe, 2002).\nNitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) are GHG.

Life on Earth is possible thanks to greenhouse effect. Without it, temperature on Earth\u2019s surface would be around -19\u00b0C, instead of the current average of 14\u00b0C. Greenhouse effect is produced by greenhouse gasses (GHG) like water vapor, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxides (NxO) and ozone (O3). GHG have natural and anthropogenic origin. However, increasing GHG provokes extreme climate changes such as floods, droughts and heat, which induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress in plants. The main sources of ROS in stress conditions are: augmented photorespiration, NADPH oxidase (NOX) activity, \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids and disorders in the electron transport chains of mitochondria and chloroplasts. Plants have developed an antioxidant machinery that includes the activity of ROS detoxifying enzymes [e.g., superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and peroxiredoxin (PRX)], as well as antioxidant molecules such as ascorbic acid (ASC) and glutathione (GSH) that are present in almost all subcellular compartments. CO2 and NO help to maintain the redox equilibrium. Higher CO2 concentrations increase the photosynthesis through the CO2-unsaturated Rubisco activity. But Rubisco photorespiration and NOX activities could also augment ROS production. NO regulate the ROS concentration preserving balance among ROS, GSH, GSNO, and ASC. When ROS are in huge concentration, NO induces transcription and activity of SOD, APX, and CAT. However, when ROS are necessary (e.g., for pathogen resistance), NO may inhibit APX, CAT, and NOX activity by the S-nitrosylation of cysteine residues, favoring cell death. NO also regulates GSH concentration in several ways. NO may react with GSH to form GSNO, the NO cell reservoir and main source of S-nitrosylation. GSNO could be decomposed by the GSNO reductase (GSNOR) to GSSG which, in turn, is reduced to GSH by glutathione reductase (GR). GSNOR may be also inhibited by S-nitrosylation and GR activated by NO. In conclusion, NO plays a central role in the tolerance of plants to climate change.\nKeywords: climate change, greenhouse effect, oxidative stress, nitric oxide, plants\nLife on Earth, as it is, relies on the natural atmospheric greenhouse effect. This is the result of a process in which a planet\u2019s atmosphere traps the sun radiation and warms the planet\u2019s surface.\nGreenhouse effect occurs in the troposphere (the lower atmosphere layer), where life and weather occur. In the absence of greenhouse effect, the average temperature on Earth\u2019s surface is estimated around -19\u00b0C, instead of the current average of 14\u00b0C (Le Treut et al., 2007). Greenhouse effect is produced by greenhouse gasses (GHG). GHG are those gaseous constituents of the atmosphere that absorb and emit radiation in the thermal infrared range (IPCC, 2014). Traces of GHG, both natural and anthropogenic, are present in the troposphere.

GHG percentages vary daily, seasonally, and annually.\nWater is present in the troposphere both as vapor and clouds. Water vapor was reported by Tyndal in 1861 as the most important gaseous absorber of variations in infrared radiation (cited in Held and Souden, 2000). Further accurate calculation estimate that water vapor and clouds are responsible for 49 and 25%, respectively, of the long wave (thermal) absorption (Schmidt et al., 2010). However, atmospheric lifetime of water vapor is short (days) compared to other GHG as CO2 (years) (IPCC, 2014).\nWater vapor concentrations are not directly influenced by anthropogenic activity and vary regionally. However, human activity increases global temperatures and water vapor formation indirectly, amplifying the warming in a process known as water vapor feedback (Soden et al., 2005).\nCarbon dioxide is responsible for 20% of the thermal absorption (Schmidt et al., 2010).\nNatural sources of CO2 include organic decomposition, ocean release and respiration.

Blue bars indicate cooler-than-average years; red bars show warmer-than-average years. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Information.\nAccording to the annual report from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, 2024 was the warmest year since global records began in 1850. The global average surface temperature was 2.32 Fahrenheit (1.29 degrees Celsius) above the 20th-century average (57.0 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.9 degrees Celsius) and 2.63 degrees Fahrenheit (1.46 degrees Celsius) above the pre-industrial average (56.7 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.7 degrees Celsius), which NOAA defines as the period from 1850-1900.\nGlobal temperatures in 2024 were above the 1991-2020 average (red) across most of the planet. Yearly temperatures compared to the 20th-century average (bar chart) show that it has been 48 years since Earth had a cooler-than-average year. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe 2024 global temperature anomaly (anomaly means \u201cdifference from average\u201d) is 0.18 degrees F (0.10 degrees C) warmer than the previous record, set the year before, in 2023. The ten warmest years in the 175-year record have all occurred during the last decade (2015\u20132024). When the new century started in 2000, the first year to set a new high-temperature record was 2005. Now, 2005 is just the 13th-warmest year on record.\nOther 2024 rankings included...\nFor more regional details and 2024 climate statistics, see the 2024 Global Climate Report from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe global average surface temperature is an indicator of the state of Earth\u2019s energy balance: how much sunlight it absorbs minus how much heat it radiates back to space. When these amounts are the same, Earth\u2019s average surface temperature remains steady. When they are out of balance, Earth cools or warms. Earth\u2019s average surface temperature has been rising because human-produced greenhouse gases are causing Earth to absorb more energy than it radiates back to space.\nGiven the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of added heat energy to raise Earth\u2019s average surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree-Fahrenheit (1-degree-Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1850-1900 in NOAA's record) might seem small, but it represents a significant increase in heat energy circulating through all parts of the Earth system, including the oceans, frozen landscapes, and the atmosphere.\nBeyond being an indicator of changes in Earth\u2019s energy balance, surface temperature matters because it controls many environmental and ecological processes that are important to humans and other life, including the water cycle (evaporation, clouds, surface water supplies, and precipitation), the carbon cycle, and the kinds of plants, animals, and other living things that can survive in different places on Earth.\nThe concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (55 degrees Celsius) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the \"average\" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget, which can only be directly measured from space.\nTo calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute temperature readings to temperature anomalies\u2014the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend.\nAcross inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and known physical relationships\u2014such as the way temperature decreases with altitude\u2014to estimate the missing values. Each value is then used to calculate a global-scale temperature anomaly. This process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in Earth's surface temperature over time. Read more about how the global surface temperature record is built in our Climate Data Primer.\nTemperature change has not been uniform across the planet, but more areas are warming than cooling.

In the past three decades, many places in the Northern Hemisphere have warmed by 1 degree Fahrenheit or more per decade. Differences are most dramatic in the Arctic.

Reactive, trace gases have short mean residence time in the atmosphere and large spatial and temporal variations in concentration. Many trace gases are removed by reaction with hydroxyl radical and deposition in rainfall or dryfall at the Earth's surface. The upper atmosphere, the stratosphere, contains ozone that screens ultraviolet light from the Earth's surface. Chlorofluorocarbons released by humans lead to the loss of stratospheric ozone, which might eventually render the Earth's land surface uninhabitable. Changes in the composition of the atmosphere, especially rising concentrations of CO2, CH4, and N2O, will lead to climatic changes over much of the Earth's surface.\nKeywords: Acid rain, Aerosols, Climate change, Atmospheric deposition, Dryfall, Hydroxyl radical, Oxygen, Ozone, Ozone hole, Troposphere, Stratosphere, Wetfall\nThere are several reasons to begin our treatment of biogeochemistry with a consideration of the atmosphere. The composition of the atmosphere has evolved as a result of the history of life on Earth (Chapter 2), and is now changing rapidly as a result of human activities. The atmosphere controls Earth's climate and ultimately determines the conditions in which we live\u2014our supplies of food and water, our health, and our economy. Further, the atmosphere is relatively well mixed, so changes in its composition can be taken as a first index of changes in biogeochemical processes at the global level. The circulation of the atmosphere transports biogeochemical constituents between the oceans and land, contributing to the global cycles of chemical elements.\nWe begin our discussion with a brief consideration of the structure, circulation, and composition of the atmosphere. Then we examine reactions that occur among various gases, especially in the lower atmosphere. Many of these reactions remove constituents from the atmosphere, depositing them on the surface of the land and sea. In the face of constant losses, the composition of the atmosphere is maintained by biotic processes that supply gases to the atmosphere. We mention the sources of atmospheric gases here briefly, but they will be treated in more detail in later chapters of this book, especially as we examine the microbial reactions that occur in soils, wetlands, and ocean sediments. Finally, we discuss human impacts on the global atmosphere, as seen in ozone depletion and climate change.\nThe atmosphere is held on Earth's surface by the gravitational attraction of the Earth. At any altitude, the downward force (F) is related to the mass (M) of the atmosphere above that point:\nwhere g is the acceleration due to gravity (980 cm/s2 at sea level). Pressure (force per unit area) decreases with increasing altitude because the mass of the overlying atmosphere is smaller (Walker, 1977). Decline in atmospheric pressure (P in bars) with altitude (A in km) is approximated by the logarithmic relation:\nover the whole atmosphere (Fig. 3.1 ).\nVertical structure and zonation of the atmosphere, showing the temperature profile to 100-km altitude. Note the logarithmic decline in pressure (left axis) as a function of altitude.\nAlthough the chemical composition of the atmosphere is relatively uniform, when we visit high mountains, we often say that the atmosphere seems \u201cthinner\u201d than at sea level. The composition is the same, but the abundance of molecules in each volume of the atmosphere is greater at sea level, because it is compressed by the pressure of the overlying atmosphere. The lower atmosphere, the troposphere, contains about 80% of the atmospheric mass (Warneck, 2000). The lower density of the upper atmosphere is the reason that jet aircraft flying at high altitudes require cabin pressurization for their passengers.\nCertain atmospheric constituents, such as ozone, aerosols, and clouds absorb and reflect portions of the radiation that the Earth receives from the Sun, so only about half of the Sun's radiation penetrates the atmosphere to be absorbed or reflected by the Earth's surface (Fig. 3.2 ). The overall reflectivity or albedo of the Earth, as measured by the CERES satellite (Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System) and by \u201cearthshine\u201d received by the Moon, is about 29% (Goode et al., 2001; Kim and Ramanathan, 2012). Albedo is affected by the reflectivity of the Earth's surface, which differs among sea water, forests and ice cover. Particles in the atmosphere absorb or reflect about 5\u201310% of the incoming solar radiation. Although some regions with air pollution have greater albedo than pristine areas, the Earth's overall albedo has not changed appreciably during the past couple of decades (Palle et al., 2016). Greater albedo reduces the radiation reaching Earth's surface and leads to \u201cglobal dimming.\u201d\nThe radiation budget for Earth, showing the proportional fate of the energy that the Earth receives from the Sun, about 340 W/m2 largely in short wavelengths.

Changes in the composition of the atmosphere, especially rising concentrations of CO2, CH4, and N2O, will lead to climatic changes over much of the Earth's surface.\nKeywords: Acid rain, Aerosols, Climate change, Atmospheric deposition, Dryfall, Hydroxyl radical, Oxygen, Ozone, Ozone hole, Troposphere, Stratosphere, Wetfall\nThere are several reasons to begin our treatment of biogeochemistry with a consideration of the atmosphere. The composition of the atmosphere has evolved as a result of the history of life on Earth (Chapter 2), and is now changing rapidly as a result of human activities. The atmosphere controls Earth's climate and ultimately determines the conditions in which we live\u2014our supplies of food and water, our health, and our economy. Further, the atmosphere is relatively well mixed, so changes in its composition can be taken as a first index of changes in biogeochemical processes at the global level. The circulation of the atmosphere transports biogeochemical constituents between the oceans and land, contributing to the global cycles of chemical elements.\nWe begin our discussion with a brief consideration of the structure, circulation, and composition of the atmosphere. Then we examine reactions that occur among various gases, especially in the lower atmosphere. Many of these reactions remove constituents from the atmosphere, depositing them on the surface of the land and sea. In the face of constant losses, the composition of the atmosphere is maintained by biotic processes that supply gases to the atmosphere. We mention the sources of atmospheric gases here briefly, but they will be treated in more detail in later chapters of this book, especially as we examine the microbial reactions that occur in soils, wetlands, and ocean sediments. Finally, we discuss human impacts on the global atmosphere, as seen in ozone depletion and climate change.\nThe atmosphere is held on Earth's surface by the gravitational attraction of the Earth. At any altitude, the downward force (F) is related to the mass (M) of the atmosphere above that point:\nwhere g is the acceleration due to gravity (980 cm/s2 at sea level). Pressure (force per unit area) decreases with increasing altitude because the mass of the overlying atmosphere is smaller (Walker, 1977). Decline in atmospheric pressure (P in bars) with altitude (A in km) is approximated by the logarithmic relation:\nover the whole atmosphere (Fig. 3.1 ).\nVertical structure and zonation of the atmosphere, showing the temperature profile to 100-km altitude. Note the logarithmic decline in pressure (left axis) as a function of altitude.\nAlthough the chemical composition of the atmosphere is relatively uniform, when we visit high mountains, we often say that the atmosphere seems \u201cthinner\u201d than at sea level. The composition is the same, but the abundance of molecules in each volume of the atmosphere is greater at sea level, because it is compressed by the pressure of the overlying atmosphere. The lower atmosphere, the troposphere, contains about 80% of the atmospheric mass (Warneck, 2000). The lower density of the upper atmosphere is the reason that jet aircraft flying at high altitudes require cabin pressurization for their passengers.\nCertain atmospheric constituents, such as ozone, aerosols, and clouds absorb and reflect portions of the radiation that the Earth receives from the Sun, so only about half of the Sun's radiation penetrates the atmosphere to be absorbed or reflected by the Earth's surface (Fig. 3.2 ). The overall reflectivity or albedo of the Earth, as measured by the CERES satellite (Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System) and by \u201cearthshine\u201d received by the Moon, is about 29% (Goode et al., 2001; Kim and Ramanathan, 2012). Albedo is affected by the reflectivity of the Earth's surface, which differs among sea water, forests and ice cover. Particles in the atmosphere absorb or reflect about 5\u201310% of the incoming solar radiation. Although some regions with air pollution have greater albedo than pristine areas, the Earth's overall albedo has not changed appreciably during the past couple of decades (Palle et al., 2016). Greater albedo reduces the radiation reaching Earth's surface and leads to \u201cglobal dimming.\u201d\nThe radiation budget for Earth, showing the proportional fate of the energy that the Earth receives from the Sun, about 340 W/m2 largely in short wavelengths. About one third of this radiation is reflected back to space and the remainder is absorbed by the atmosphere (23%) or the surface (46%). Long-wave radiation (infra-red) is emitted from the Earth's surface, some of which is absorbed by atmospheric gases, warming the atmosphere\u2014the greenhouse effect. The atmosphere emits long-wave radiation, so that the total energy received is balanced by the total energy emitted from the planet.\nSource: Stephens et al. (2012).\nThe land and ocean surfaces reradiate long wave (heat) radiation to the atmosphere, so the atmosphere is heated from the bottom and is warmest at the Earth's surface (Fig. 3.1). Because warm air is less dense and rises, the troposphere is well mixed. The top of the troposphere extends to 8\u201317 km, varying seasonally and with latitude. The temperature of the upper troposphere is about \u2212 60 \u00b0C, which ensures that the atmosphe\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe 2024 global temperature anomaly (anomaly means \u201cdifference from average\u201d) is 0.18 degrees F (0.10 degrees C) warmer than the previous record, set the year before, in 2023. The ten warmest years in the 175-year record have all occurred during the last decade (2015\u20132024). When the new century started in 2000, the first year to set a new high-temperature record was 2005. Now, 2005 is just the 13th-warmest year on record.\nOther 2024 rankings included...\nFor more regional details and 2024 climate statistics, see the 2024 Global Climate Report from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe global average surface temperature is an indicator of the state of Earth\u2019s energy balance: how much sunlight it absorbs minus how much heat it radiates back to space. When these amounts are the same, Earth\u2019s average surface temperature remains steady. When they are out of balance, Earth cools or warms. Earth\u2019s average surface temperature has been rising because human-produced greenhouse gases are causing Earth to absorb more energy than it radiates back to space.\nGiven the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of added heat energy to raise Earth\u2019s average surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree-Fahrenheit (1-degree-Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1850-1900 in NOAA's record) might seem small, but it represents a significant increase in heat energy circulating through all parts of the Earth system, including the oceans, frozen landscapes, and the atmosphere.\nBeyond being an indicator of changes in Earth\u2019s energy balance, surface temperature matters because it controls many environmental and ecological processes that are important to humans and other life, including the water cycle (evaporation, clouds, surface water supplies, and precipitation), the carbon cycle, and the kinds of plants, animals, and other living things that can survive in different places on Earth.\nThe concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (55 degrees Celsius) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the \"average\" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget, which can only be directly measured from space.\nTo calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute temperature readings to temperature anomalies\u2014the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend.\nAcross inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and known physical relationships\u2014such as the way temperature decreases with altitude\u2014to estimate the missing values. Each value is then used to calculate a global-scale temperature anomaly. This process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in Earth's surface temperature over time. Read more about how the global surface temperature record is built in our Climate Data Primer.\nTemperature change has not been uniform across the planet, but more areas are warming than cooling. And the rate of warming has accelerated in recent decades. According to NOAA's 2024 Annual Climate Report the combined land and ocean temperature has warmed at an average rate of 0.11 degrees Fahrenheit (0.06 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1850 and more than three times that rate (0.36 degrees Fahrenheit, or 0.20 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1975.\nRecent rates of global warming (1994-2024, bottom) are larger than the longer-term average rates (1901-2024, top). Places that have cooled are colored blue; places that have warmed are colored yellow, orange, or red. In the past three decades, many places in the Northern Hemisphere have warmed by 1 degree Fahrenheit or more per decade. Differences are most dramatic in the Arctic.

The lower density of the upper atmosphere is the reason that jet aircraft flying at high altitudes require cabin pressurization for their passengers.\nCertain atmospheric constituents, such as ozone, aerosols, and clouds absorb and reflect portions of the radiation that the Earth receives from the Sun, so only about half of the Sun's radiation penetrates the atmosphere to be absorbed or reflected by the Earth's surface (Fig. 3.2 ). The overall reflectivity or albedo of the Earth, as measured by the CERES satellite (Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System) and by \u201cearthshine\u201d received by the Moon, is about 29% (Goode et al., 2001; Kim and Ramanathan, 2012). Albedo is affected by the reflectivity of the Earth's surface, which differs among sea water, forests and ice cover. Particles in the atmosphere absorb or reflect about 5\u201310% of the incoming solar radiation. Although some regions with air pollution have greater albedo than pristine areas, the Earth's overall albedo has not changed appreciably during the past couple of decades (Palle et al., 2016). Greater albedo reduces the radiation reaching Earth's surface and leads to \u201cglobal dimming.\u201d\nThe radiation budget for Earth, showing the proportional fate of the energy that the Earth receives from the Sun, about 340 W/m2 largely in short wavelengths. About one third of this radiation is reflected back to space and the remainder is absorbed by the atmosphere (23%) or the surface (46%). Long-wave radiation (infra-red) is emitted from the Earth's surface, some of which is absorbed by atmospheric gases, warming the atmosphere\u2014the greenhouse effect. The atmosphere emits long-wave radiation, so that the total energy received is balanced by the total energy emitted from the planet.\nSource: Stephens et al. (2012).\nThe land and ocean surfaces reradiate long wave (heat) radiation to the atmosphere, so the atmosphere is heated from the bottom and is warmest at the Earth's surface (Fig. 3.1). Because warm air is less dense and rises, the troposphere is well mixed. The top of the troposphere extends to 8\u201317 km, varying seasonally and with latitude. The temperature of the upper troposphere is about \u2212 60 \u00b0C, which ensures that the atmosphe\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Blue bars indicate cooler-than-average years; red bars show warmer-than-average years. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Information.\nAccording to the annual report from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, 2024 was the warmest year since global records began in 1850. The global average surface temperature was 2.32 Fahrenheit (1.29 degrees Celsius) above the 20th-century average (57.0 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.9 degrees Celsius) and 2.63 degrees Fahrenheit (1.46 degrees Celsius) above the pre-industrial average (56.7 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.7 degrees Celsius), which NOAA defines as the period from 1850-1900.\nGlobal temperatures in 2024 were above the 1991-2020 average (red) across most of the planet. Yearly temperatures compared to the 20th-century average (bar chart) show that it has been 48 years since Earth had a cooler-than-average year. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe 2024 global temperature anomaly (anomaly means \u201cdifference from average\u201d) is 0.18 degrees F (0.10 degrees C) warmer than the previous record, set the year before, in 2023. The ten warmest years in the 175-year record have all occurred during the last decade (2015\u20132024). When the new century started in 2000, the first year to set a new high-temperature record was 2005. Now, 2005 is just the 13th-warmest year on record.\nOther 2024 rankings included...\nFor more regional details and 2024 climate statistics, see the 2024 Global Climate Report from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe global average surface temperature is an indicator of the state of Earth\u2019s energy balance: how much sunlight it absorbs minus how much heat it radiates back to space. When these amounts are the same, Earth\u2019s average surface temperature remains steady. When they are out of balance, Earth cools or warms. Earth\u2019s average surface temperature has been rising because human-produced greenhouse gases are causing Earth to absorb more energy than it radiates back to space.\nGiven the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of added heat energy to raise Earth\u2019s average surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree-Fahrenheit (1-degree-Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1850-1900 in NOAA's record) might seem small, but it represents a significant increase in heat energy circulating through all parts of the Earth system, including the oceans, frozen landscapes, and the atmosphere.\nBeyond being an indicator of changes in Earth\u2019s energy balance, surface temperature matters because it controls many environmental and ecological processes that are important to humans and other life, including the water cycle (evaporation, clouds, surface water supplies, and precipitation), the carbon cycle, and the kinds of plants, animals, and other living things that can survive in different places on Earth.\nThe concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (55 degrees Celsius) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the \"average\" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget, which can only be directly measured from space.\nTo calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute temperature readings to temperature anomalies\u2014the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend.\nAcross inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and known physical relationships\u2014such as the way temperature decreases with altitude\u2014to estimate the missing values. Each value is then used to calculate a global-scale temperature anomaly. This process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in Earth's surface temperature over time. Read more about how the global surface temperature record is built in our Climate Data Primer.\nTemperature change has not been uniform across the planet, but more areas are warming than cooling. And the rate of warming has accelerated in recent decades. According to NOAA's 2024 Annual Climate Report the combined land and ocean temperature has warmed at an average rate of 0.11 degrees Fahrenheit (0.06 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1850 and more than three times that rate (0.36 degrees Fahrenheit, or 0.20 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1975.\nRecent rates of global warming (1994-2024, bottom) are larger than the longer-term average rates (1901-2024, top). Places that have cooled are colored blue; places that have warmed are colored yellow, orange, or red. In the past three decades, many places in the Northern Hemisphere have warmed by 1 degree Fahrenheit or more per decade. Differences are most dramatic in the Arctic. With the decline of ice and snow, the Arctic reflects less incoming sunlight, which amplifies the rate of greenhouse-gas-driven warming. NOAA Climate.gov, based o\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The remaining 1% contains several inactive gases.\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nThe atmosphere is composed of nitrogen, oxygen and argon, a variety of trace gases, and particles or aerosols from a variety of sources. Reactive, trace gases have short mean residence time in the atmosphere and large spatial and temporal variations in concentration. Many trace gases are removed by reaction with hydroxyl radical and deposition in rainfall or dryfall at the Earth's surface. The upper atmosphere, the stratosphere, contains ozone that screens ultraviolet light from the Earth's surface. Chlorofluorocarbons released by humans lead to the loss of stratospheric ozone, which might eventually render the Earth's land surface uninhabitable. Changes in the composition of the atmosphere, especially rising concentrations of CO2, CH4, and N2O, will lead to climatic changes over much of the Earth's surface.\nKeywords: Acid rain, Aerosols, Climate change, Atmospheric deposition, Dryfall, Hydroxyl radical, Oxygen, Ozone, Ozone hole, Troposphere, Stratosphere, Wetfall\nThere are several reasons to begin our treatment of biogeochemistry with a consideration of the atmosphere. The composition of the atmosphere has evolved as a result of the history of life on Earth (Chapter 2), and is now changing rapidly as a result of human activities. The atmosphere controls Earth's climate and ultimately determines the conditions in which we live\u2014our supplies of food and water, our health, and our economy. Further, the atmosphere is relatively well mixed, so changes in its composition can be taken as a first index of changes in biogeochemical processes at the global level. The circulation of the atmosphere transports biogeochemical constituents between the oceans and land, contributing to the global cycles of chemical elements.\nWe begin our discussion with a brief consideration of the structure, circulation, and composition of the atmosphere. Then we examine reactions that occur among various gases, especially in the lower atmosphere. Many of these reactions remove constituents from the atmosphere, depositing them on the surface of the land and sea. In the face of constant losses, the composition of the atmosphere is maintained by biotic processes that supply gases to the atmosphere. We mention the sources of atmospheric gases here briefly, but they will be treated in more detail in later chapters of this book, especially as we examine the microbial reactions that occur in soils, wetlands, and ocean sediments. Finally, we discuss human impacts on the global atmosphere, as seen in ozone depletion and climate change.\nThe atmosphere is held on Earth's surface by the gravitational attraction of the Earth. At any altitude, the downward force (F) is related to the mass (M) of the atmosphere above that point:\nwhere g is the acceleration due to gravity (980 cm/s2 at sea level). Pressure (force per unit area) decreases with increasing altitude because the mass of the overlying atmosphere is smaller (Walker, 1977). Decline in atmospheric pressure (P in bars) with altitude (A in km) is approximated by the logarithmic relation:\nover the whole atmosphere (Fig. 3.1 ).\nVertical structure and zonation of the atmosphere, showing the temperature profile to 100-km altitude. Note the logarithmic decline in pressure (left axis) as a function of altitude.\nAlthough the chemical composition of the atmosphere is relatively uniform, when we visit high mountains, we often say that the atmosphere seems \u201cthinner\u201d than at sea level. The composition is the same, but the abundance of molecules in each volume of the atmosphere is greater at sea level, because it is compressed by the pressure of the overlying atmosphere. The lower atmosphere, the troposphere, contains about 80% of the atmospheric mass (Warneck, 2000).
