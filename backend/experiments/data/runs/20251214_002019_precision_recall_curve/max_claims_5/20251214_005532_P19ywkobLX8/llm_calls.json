    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nHubris is a Greek word that means dangerously overconfident. Based on my research, hubris fairly describes our current response to the issue of climate change. Here\u2019s what many people believe: One: The planet is warming catastrophically because of certain human behaviors. Two: Thanks to powerful computers we can project what the climate will be like 20, 40, or even 100 years from now. Three: That if we eliminate just one behavior, the burning of fossil fuels, we can prevent the climate from changing for as long we like. Each of these presumptions\u2014together, the basis of our hubris regarding the changing climate\u2014is either untrue or so far off the mark as to be useless. Yes, it\u2019s true that the globe is warming, and that humans are exerting a warming influence upon it. But beyond that, to paraphrase a line from the classic movie The Princess Bride, \u201cI do not think \u2018The Science\u2019 says what you think it says.\u201d For example, government reports state clearly that heat waves in the US are now no more common than they were in 1900. Hurricane activity is no different than it was a century ago. Floods have not increased across the globe over more than seventy years. Greenland\u2019s ice sheet isn\u2019t shrinking any more rapidly today than it was 80 years ago. Why aren\u2019t these reassuring facts better known? Because the public gets its climate information almost exclusively from the media. And from a media perspective, fear sells. \u201cThings aren\u2019t that bad\u201d doesn\u2019t sell. Very few people, and that includes journalists who report on climate news, read the actual science. I have. And what the data\u2014the hard science\u2014from the US government and UN Climate reports say is that\u2026 \u201cthings aren\u2019t that bad.\u201d Nor does the public understand the questionable basis of all catastrophic climate change projections: computer modeling. Projecting future climate is excruciatingly difficult. Yes, there are human influences, but the climate is complex. Anyone who says that climate models are \u201cjust physics\u201d either doesn\u2019t understand them or is being deliberately misleading. I should know: I wrote one of the first textbooks on computer modeling. While modelers base their assumptions upon both fundamental physical laws and observations of the climate, there is still considerable judgment involved. And since different modelers will make different assumptions, results vary widely among different models. Let\u2019s just take one simple, but significant assumption modelers must make: the impact of clouds on the climate. Natural fluctuations in the height and coverage of clouds have at least as much of an impact on the flows of sunlight and heat as do human influences. But how can we possibly know global cloud coverage say 10, let alone 50 years from now? Obviously, we can\u2019t. But to create a climate model, we have to make assumptions. That\u2019s a pretty shaky foundation on which to transform the world\u2019s economy. By the way, creating more accurate models isn\u2019t getting any easier. In fact, the more we learn about the climate system, the more we realize how complex it is. Rather than admit this complexity, the media, the politicians, and a good portion of the climate science community attribute every terrible storm, every flood, every major fire to \u201cclimate change.\u201d Yes, we\u2019ve always had these weather events in the past, the narrative goes, but somehow \u201cclimate change\u201d is making everything \u201cworse.\u201d Even if that were true, isn\u2019t the relevant question, how much worse? Not to mention that \u201cworse\u201d is not exactly a scientific term. And how would we make it better? For the alarmists, that\u2019s easy: we get rid of fossil fuels. Not only is this impractical\u2014we get over 80% of the world\u2019s energy from fossil fuels\u2014it\u2019s not scientifically possible. That\u2019s because CO2 doesn\u2019t disappear from the atmosphere in a few days like, say, smog. It hangs around for a really long time. About 60 percent of any CO2 that we emit today will remain in the atmosphere 20 years from now, between 30 and 55 percent will still be there after a century, and between 15 and 30 percent will remain after one thousand years. In other words, it takes centuries for the excess carbon dioxide to vanish from the atmosphere. So, any partial reductions in CO2 emissions would only slow the increase in human influences\u2014not prevent it, let alone reverse it. CO2 is not a knob that we can just turn down to fix everything. We don\u2019t have that ability. To think that we do is\u2026 hubris. Hubris leads to bad decisions. A little humility and a little knowledge would lead to better ones.

Even after you\u2019ve bought something, its harm to the climate could continue through the electricity it uses to operate, the power needed to run it through the wash, or the waste it generates once it's discarded.\nBut what exactly are greenhouse gases, and why do they have such a profound effect on Earth\u2019s climate? Understanding how greenhouse gases originate and how to measure their effects on the climate is crucial for tackling the biggest environmental challenge of our time. In this resource, you\u2019ll learn how everyday actions and choices can help or hurt our planet.\nHumans have dramatically changed the atmosphere over the past few centuries, mainly by releasing vast amounts of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2). That story begins in the 1700s with the Industrial Revolution, a time when human society began to change rapidly. Before that period, economies relied largely on agriculture. Most finished products were produced slowly and laboriously by skilled artisans. Human activity still produced greenhouse gases, but at much lower levels.\nEverything shifted when new manufacturing processes and machines, like the steam engine, arrived on the scene. To power growing industries, societies needed to burn fuel, and lots of it. Increasingly, that fuel came in the form of coal.\nA painting from 1855 of the Burmeister and Wain iron foundry in Copenhagen, Denmark.\nSource: Peder Severin Kroye via Statens Museum for Kunst\nCoal was a game changer because it was relatively packed with energy (around three times as much energy as the same amount of wood), and it was relatively easy to access. When burned, coal could efficiently power the new steam engines that drove factories, trains, and ships, allowing industries to grow like never before. Coal use set off a chain reaction: factories popped up everywhere, cities expanded, and people began moving in huge numbers to urban areas for work. That sparked the beginning of a global shift toward using fossil fuels\u2014coal, oil, and natural gas\u2014to power nearly every aspect of modern life.\nToday, those fuels are the backbone of modern society. However, burning fossil fuels releases CO2 into the atmosphere. How does that happen? Well, fossil fuels are formed from the remains of ancient plants and animals buried deep in the earth\u2014most of which are composed of carbon. Over millions of years, heat and pressure turned those remains into energy-rich substances. So, when people burn those fuels for energy, they are sending CO2, which was once trapped underground, into the atmosphere. The CO2 then traps heat from the sun in the atmosphere, making the earth warmer\u2014a process known as the greenhouse effect.\nAlthough fossil fuels are the main culprits, other human activity is driving climate change too. Cutting down forests and developing land has led to more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Also, as the world modernizes and grows wealthier, diets have changed, too. With more people able to afford meat, the demand for farm-raised animals like cows and sheep has soared. However, those animals release methane (CH4)\u2014a greenhouse gas even more potent than CO2\u2014during digestion. Plus, fertilizers that farmers use to grow more food releases nitrous oxide (N2O), another heat-trapping gas.\nCattle ranchers herd their cows in Miranda, Brazil in 2023.\nSource: Universal Images / Getty Images\nOn top of that, some newer technologies meant to improve human lives also contribute to the problem. Air conditioning and refrigeration, among other modern conveniences, rely on fluorinated gases to run. Those gases were designed as safer replacements for chemicals that damaged the ozone layer. However, they are extremely effective at trapping heat\u2014more than ten thousand times stronger than CO2. As those appliances have become more widespread, the use of fluorinated gases has surged.\nAlthough carbon dioxide is the most common greenhouse gas, it isn't the strongest at trapping heat. Gases like methane and nitrous oxide are much better at holding in heat from the sun. Some can linger in the atmosphere for a long time, making them even more powerful in warming the planet.\nFor each greenhouse gas, scientists calculate its global warming potential (GWP). That measure factors in how much heat a gas can trap and how long it stays in the atmosphere. The GWP score is essentially a comparison to carbon dioxide\u2019s role in global warming.\nDifferent human activities release different greenhouse gases in varying amounts. So, leaders need to consider the GWP of the gases their climate policies would regulate. If they are trying to keep the world from warming by more than a certain degree, they need to know which gases to limit by how much.\nHumans produce greenhouse gases through a wide range of activities. To help track them all, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) divides them up into five primary sectors: energy, industry, agriculture and land use, transportation, and buildings.\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at each of the categories.\nEnergy: The world depends on electricity for nearly everything\u2014charging devices, runni\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Over millions of years, heat and pressure turned those remains into energy-rich substances. So, when people burn those fuels for energy, they are sending CO2, which was once trapped underground, into the atmosphere. The CO2 then traps heat from the sun in the atmosphere, making the earth warmer\u2014a process known as the greenhouse effect.\nAlthough fossil fuels are the main culprits, other human activity is driving climate change too. Cutting down forests and developing land has led to more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Also, as the world modernizes and grows wealthier, diets have changed, too. With more people able to afford meat, the demand for farm-raised animals like cows and sheep has soared. However, those animals release methane (CH4)\u2014a greenhouse gas even more potent than CO2\u2014during digestion. Plus, fertilizers that farmers use to grow more food releases nitrous oxide (N2O), another heat-trapping gas.\nCattle ranchers herd their cows in Miranda, Brazil in 2023.\nSource: Universal Images / Getty Images\nOn top of that, some newer technologies meant to improve human lives also contribute to the problem. Air conditioning and refrigeration, among other modern conveniences, rely on fluorinated gases to run. Those gases were designed as safer replacements for chemicals that damaged the ozone layer. However, they are extremely effective at trapping heat\u2014more than ten thousand times stronger than CO2. As those appliances have become more widespread, the use of fluorinated gases has surged.\nAlthough carbon dioxide is the most common greenhouse gas, it isn't the strongest at trapping heat. Gases like methane and nitrous oxide are much better at holding in heat from the sun. Some can linger in the atmosphere for a long time, making them even more powerful in warming the planet.\nFor each greenhouse gas, scientists calculate its global warming potential (GWP). That measure factors in how much heat a gas can trap and how long it stays in the atmosphere. The GWP score is essentially a comparison to carbon dioxide\u2019s role in global warming.\nDifferent human activities release different greenhouse gases in varying amounts. So, leaders need to consider the GWP of the gases their climate policies would regulate. If they are trying to keep the world from warming by more than a certain degree, they need to know which gases to limit by how much.\nHumans produce greenhouse gases through a wide range of activities. To help track them all, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) divides them up into five primary sectors: energy, industry, agriculture and land use, transportation, and buildings.\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at each of the categories.\nEnergy: The world depends on electricity for nearly everything\u2014charging devices, runni\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

A recent study found that glacial retreat caused the Greenland Ice Sheet to lose one-fifth more mass than previously estimated. Credit: NASA/USGS\nThe Greenland Ice Sheet has shed about one-fifth more ice mass in the past four decades than previously estimated, researchers at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California reported in a new paper. The majority of glaciers on the landmass have retreated significantly, and icebergs are falling into the ocean at an accelerating rate. This additional ice loss has had only an indirect impact on sea levels, but could hold implications for ocean circulation in the future.\nPublished in Nature on Jan. 17, the analysis offers a comprehensive look at retreat around the edges of the entire ice sheet from 1985 to 2022, drawing from nearly a quarter million pieces of satellite data on glacier positions. Of the 207 glaciers in the study, 179 retreated significantly since 1985, 27 held steady, and one advanced slightly.\nZachariae Isstrom, a glacier in northeast Greenland, retreated significantly between 1999 (left) and 2022 (right) as icebergs broke off at an accelerating rate. A recent study found that it lost 176 billion tons (160 billion metric tons) of ice from 1985 to 2022. Credit: NASA/USGS\nMost of the ice loss came from below sea level, in fjords on Greenland\u2019s periphery. Once occupied by ancient glacial ice, many of these deep coastal valleys have filled with seawater \u2013 meaning the ice that broke off made little net contribution to sea level. But the loss likely accelerated the movement of ice flowing down from higher elevations, which in turn added to sea level rise.\n\u201cWhen the ice at the end of a glacier calves and retreats, it\u2019s like pulling the plug out of the fjord, which lets ice drain into the ocean faster,\u201d said Chad Greene, a glacier scientist at JPL and the study\u2019s lead author.\nGet the Latest JPL News\nFor decades researchers have studied the Greenland Ice Sheet\u2019s direct contributions to global sea level rise through ice flow and melting. Scientists participating in the international Ice sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise (IMBIE) estimated that the ice sheet had lost 5,390 billion tons (4,890 billion metric tons) between 1992 and 2020, adding about 0.531 inches (13.5 millimeters) to global mean sea level, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\nBut the IMBIE measurements do not account for ice lost due to the retreat of terminal glaciers along the edges of Greenland. (These glacier edges were already in the water, whether submerged or floating.) The new study quantifies this amount: For the 1985 to 2022 period in the new paper, the ice sheet was estimated to have lost about 1,140 billion tons (1,034 billion metric tons) \u2013 21% more mass lost than in the IMBIE assessment.\nAlthough it doesn\u2019t add to sea levels, the additional ice represents a significant influx of fresh water to the ocean. Recent studies have suggested that changes in the salinity of the North Atlantic Ocean from melting icebergs could weaken the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, part of the global \u201cconveyor belt\u201d of currents that transport heat and salt around the ocean. This could influence weather patterns worldwide, as well as affect ecosystems, the authors said.\nIcebergs have tumbled from Greenland\u2019s glaciers for thousands of years as part of a natural cycle that typically balanced glacier growth in the winter with melting and retreat in the summer. The new study finds that ice retreat has far outpaced growth throughout the 21st century.\nThe researchers also found that Greenland\u2019s ice extent remained relatively steady from 1985 to 2000, then started a marked recession that continues to this day.\nThe data showed a glacier in northeast Greenland called Zachariae Isstrom lost the most ice, dropping 176 billion tons (160 billion metric tons) of mass due to retreat. It was followed by Jakobshavn Isbrae on the western coast, which lost an estimated 97 billion tons (88 billion metric tons), and Humboldt Gletscher in the northwest, which lost 96 billion tons (87 billion metric tons).\nOnly one glacier, Qajuuttap Sermia in southern Greenland, experienced any growth over the study period, but its gains were too small to offset the losses from other glaciers.\nThe researchers also found that glaciers with the largest seasonal fluctuations in the position of their ice front experienced the greatest overall retreat. The correlation suggests the glaciers that are most sensitive to warming each summer will be most impacted by climate change in the coming decades.\nThe discovery of a large-scale pattern of glacier retreat and its link to glacier sensitivity on seasonal time scales was the result of a big-data synthesis that looks at all parts of the ice sheet over time, said JPL cryosphere scientist Alex Gardner, a co-author of the paper. Scientists drew from five publicly available datasets that cumulatively tracked the month-to-month positions of 236,328 glacier edges as detected, either manually or by computer algorithms, in images collected by optical and radar satellites.\n\u201cPreviously, we had bits and pieces \u2013 lots of local studies,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cBut what this study offers is a systematic and comprehensive view that has led to some pretty significant insights that we didn\u2019t have about the ice sheet before.\u201d\nAndrew Wang / Jane J.

The current survey examines the literature published from 2012 to November 2020 to explore whether the consensus has changed.\n\u201cWe are virtually certain that the consensus is well over 99% now and that it\u2019s pretty much case closed for any meaningful public conversation about the reality of human-caused climate change,\u201d said Mark Lynas, a visiting fellow at the Alliance for Science and the paper\u2019s first author.\n\u201cIt's critical to acknowledge the principal role of greenhouse gas emissions so that we can rapidly mobilize new solutions, since we are already witnessing in real time the devastating impacts of climate related disasters on businesses, people and the economy,\u201d said Benjamin Houlton, the Ronald P. Lynch Dean of the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and a co-author of the study, \u201cGreater than 99% Consensus on Human Caused Climate Change in the Peer-Reviewed Scientific Literature,\u201d which published Oct. 19 in the journal Environmental Research Letters.\nIn spite of such results, public opinion polls as well as opinions of politicians and public representatives point to false beliefs and claims that a significant debate still exists among scientists over the true cause of climate change. In 2016, the Pew Research Center found that only 27% of U.S. adults believe that \u201calmost all\u201d scientists agreed that climate change is due to human activity, according to the paper. A 2021 Gallup poll pointed to a deepening partisan divide in American politics on whether Earth\u2019s rising observed temperatures since the Industrial Revolution were primarily caused by humans.\n\u201cTo understand where a consensus exists, you have to be able to quantify it,\u201d Lynas said. \u201cThat means surveying the literature in a coherent and non-arbitrary way in order to avoid trading cherry-picked papers, which is often how these arguments are carried out in the public sphere.\u201d\nIn the study, the researchers began by examining a random sample of 3,000 studies from the dataset of 88,125 English-language climate papers published between 2012 and 2020. They found only found four out of the 3,000 papers were skeptical of human-caused climate change. \u201cWe knew that [climate skeptical papers] were vanishingly small in terms of their occurrence, but we thought there still must be more in the 88,000,\u201d Lynas said.\nCo-author Simon Perry, a United Kingdom-based software engineer and volunteer at the Alliance for Science, created an algorithm that searched out keywords from papers the team knew were skeptical, such as \u201csolar,\u201d \u201ccosmic rays\u201d and \u201cnatural cycles.\u201d The algorithm was applied to all 88,000-plus papers, and the program ordered them so the skeptical ones came higher in the order. They found many of these dissenting papers near the top, as expected, with diminishing returns further down the list. Overall, the search yielded 28 papers that were implicitly or explicitly skeptical, all published in minor journals.\nIf the 97% result from the 2013 study still left some doubt on scientific consensus on the human influence on climate, the current findings go even further to allay any uncertainty, Lynas said. \u201cThis pretty much should be the last word,\u201d he said.\nSupport for the Alliance for Science is provided by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\nGet Cornell news delivered right to your inbox.\nCornell Chronicle 120 Maple Ave. Ithaca, NY 14850 cunews@cornell.edu\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Data gathered from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI, formerly the National Climatic Data Center) (figure 1) shows that in a 12 year period from 1998 to 2009, heat has caused the most deaths for 5 out of the 12 years. Although this is not more than half of the years, it comes out number one in more years than any other weather related phenomenon. Looking at the 12 year average however clearly shows that heat comes out ahead of all the other phenomena, with an average of 154 deaths, followed by convection with 129. The only time heat is surpassed by a large margin is with Hurricane Katrina in 2005 where over 1000 people were killed. 1999 saw a peak in heat related fatalities, likely due to the extremely hot summer (Pollina et al., 2013).\nFigure 1. Weather related fatalities from 1998-2009.\nClimate change is a well established scientific fact. The Fifth Assessment Report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change states that \"the science now shows with 95% certainty that human activity is the dominant cause of observed warming since the mid 20th century\". Climate models show that there will be anywhere from a 0.5\u00b0C to just under 4.5\u00b0C increase in global temperatures at the surface by the year 2100 (Cubasch et al. 2013). As temperatures warm in the future, humans will become more susceptible to the effects of extreme heat.\nUrban areas are more likely to suffer from extreme heat due to the urban heat island effect, a well known meteorological phenomenon where urban areas are warmer than the surrounding rural areas due to storage of short wave radiation in the concrete, asphalt, and buildings of the urban setting as opposed to the vegetative nature of the rural areas (Solecki et al. 2005, U.S. EPA 2013). Nighttime temperatures show a more drastic difference between urban and rural areas as opposed to daytime temperatures. For example, temperatures on a calm, cloudless night can be up to 20 degrees cooler at Westhampton Beach, NY than in Central Park, NY, which is located 70 miles east of Central Park. Therefore, extreme heat becomes more of a problem for urban areas, especially so given the fact that the global temperature is expected to continue to increase in the future.\nThe Earth is warming and urban areas will be more at risk for extreme heat, but why even care about heat since we have air conditioning? Air conditioning has become more prevalent in NYC over the decades. In 1970, only about 39% of NYC households had air conditioning. By 1987, that figure increased to 57%. By 2009, close to 88% of all households in NYC has air conditioning (United States Census Bureau). It would seem that with air conditioning becoming more prevalent, we need not worry about heat. That would be true if NYC stood at 100% of all households with air conditioning, but as of 2009, it does not. Some cannot afford it, such as the elderly and those in lower socioeconomic areas. But also, what would happen if a storm Such as Superstorm Sandy occurred in the summer? That could leave potentially millions of people without power and therefore air conditioning, even if 100% of NYC households had air conditioning.\nWhat is a heat wave? There is no standard definition. In 1901, A.T. Burrows defined a heat wave (or as he termed it, hot wave) as 3 or more days in which the maximum temperature in the shade reached or exceeded 90\u00b0F. Robinson et al. (2001) notes that there is a lack of rigorous definition, although he does provide a basic definition as \"it is an extended period of unusually high atmosphere-related heat stress, which causes temporary modification in lifestyle and which may have adverse health consequences for the affected population.\" The Glossary of Meteorology from the National Weather Service defines a heat wave as \"a period of abnormally and uncomfortably hot and usually humid weather\", but does note that it is based on what is normal for a given region of the world. For example, what is warm in Maine is not considered warm in the U.S. Southwest. A locally defined heat wave will be advantageous in many ways. For the public, when a heat wave is forecast, steps can be taken to alleviate heat stress, such as opening cooling centers as is done in NYC when heat advisories or excessive heat warnings are issued. It will also give clarification for the public. In places where there are no locally defined heat waves, the public may be confused as to whether 2 or 3 days constitutes a heat wave. This may not seem like much of a difference, but the prolonged nature of heat waves, which may contain days of excessive heat, can have negative side effects. Epidemiologic analysis conducted by the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene revealed that there is a cumulative impact on consecutive days of extreme heat, with each day adding to the risk of previous days (Metzger 2010). Finally, it would provide a standard definition for local media, especially in a high market area such as NYC, where multiple media outlets could define a heat wave anyway they see fit.\nBecause extreme heat is a major killer and the effects of heat waves (which need to be locally defined) are cumulative, along with the fact that the global temperature is expected to continue and urban areas are warmer than their surrounding rural areas, a heat wave study of NYC is needed. This heat wave study will answer the following questions:\nThe results from this study could be used by forecasters of the local Weather Forecast Office (WFO) of New York, NY (OKX) to better forecast these events. If forecasters are better able to predict the onset of a heatwave, they will be able to alert the public about an impending heat wave, allowing the public to take the necessary precautions to prepare for the heatwave.

The majority of glaciers on the landmass have retreated significantly, and icebergs are falling into the ocean at an accelerating rate. This additional ice loss has had only an indirect impact on sea levels, but could hold implications for ocean circulation in the future.\nPublished in Nature on Jan. 17, the analysis offers a comprehensive look at retreat around the edges of the entire ice sheet from 1985 to 2022, drawing from nearly a quarter million pieces of satellite data on glacier positions.

Credit: NASA/USGS\nMost of the ice loss came from below sea level, in fjords on Greenland\u2019s periphery. Once occupied by ancient glacial ice, many of these deep coastal valleys have filled with seawater \u2013 meaning the ice that broke off made little net contribution to sea level. But the loss likely accelerated the movement of ice flowing down from higher elevations, which in turn added to sea level rise.\n\u201cWhen the ice at the end of a glacier calves and retreats, it\u2019s like pulling the plug out of the fjord, which lets ice drain into the ocean faster,\u201d said Chad Greene, a glacier scientist at JPL and the study\u2019s lead author.\nGet the Latest JPL News\nFor decades researchers have studied the Greenland Ice Sheet\u2019s direct contributions to global sea level rise through ice flow and melting. Scientists participating in the international Ice sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise (IMBIE) estimated that the ice sheet had lost 5,390 billion tons (4,890 billion metric tons) between 1992 and 2020, adding about 0.531 inches (13.5 millimeters) to global mean sea level, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\nBut the IMBIE measurements do not account for ice lost due to the retreat of terminal glaciers along the edges of Greenland. (These glacier edges were already in the water, whether submerged or floating.) The new study quantifies this amount: For the 1985 to 2022 period in the new paper, the ice sheet was estimated to have lost about 1,140 billion tons (1,034 billion metric tons) \u2013 21% more mass lost than in the IMBIE assessment.\nAlthough it doesn\u2019t add to sea levels, the additional ice represents a significant influx of fresh water to the ocean. Recent studies have suggested that changes in the salinity of the North Atlantic Ocean from melting icebergs could weaken the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, part of the global \u201cconveyor belt\u201d of currents that transport heat and salt around the ocean. This could influence weather patterns worldwide, as well as affect ecosystems, the authors said.\nIcebergs have tumbled from Greenland\u2019s glaciers for thousands of years as part of a natural cycle that typically balanced glacier growth in the winter with melting and retreat in the summer. The new study finds that ice retreat has far outpaced growth throughout the 21st century.\nThe researchers also found that Greenland\u2019s ice extent remained relatively steady from 1985 to 2000, then started a marked recession that continues to this day.\nThe data showed a glacier in northeast Greenland called Zachariae Isstrom lost the most ice, dropping 176 billion tons (160 billion metric tons) of mass due to retreat. It was followed by Jakobshavn Isbrae on the western coast, which lost an estimated 97 billion tons (88 billion metric tons), and Humboldt Gletscher in the northwest, which lost 96 billion tons (87 billion metric tons).\nOnly one glacier, Qajuuttap Sermia in southern Greenland, experienced any growth over the study period, but its gains were too small to offset the losses from other glaciers.\nThe researchers also found that glaciers with the largest seasonal fluctuations in the position of their ice front experienced the greatest overall retreat. The correlation suggests the glaciers that are most sensitive to warming each summer will be most impacted by climate change in the coming decades.\nThe discovery of a large-scale pattern of glacier retreat and its link to glacier sensitivity on seasonal time scales was the result of a big-data synthesis that looks at all parts of the ice sheet over time, said JPL cryosphere scientist Alex Gardner, a co-author of the paper. Scientists drew from five publicly available datasets that cumulatively tracked the month-to-month positions of 236,328 glacier edges as detected, either manually or by computer algorithms, in images collected by optical and radar satellites.\n\u201cPreviously, we had bits and pieces \u2013 lots of local studies,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cBut what this study offers is a systematic and comprehensive view that has led to some pretty significant insights that we didn\u2019t have about the ice sheet before.\u201d\nAndrew Wang / Jane J.

The current survey examines the literature published from 2012 to November 2020 to explore whether the consensus has changed.\n\u201cWe are virtually certain that the consensus is well over 99% now and that it\u2019s pretty much case closed for any meaningful public conversation about the reality of human-caused climate change,\u201d said Mark Lynas, a visiting fellow at the Alliance for Science and the paper\u2019s first author.\n\u201cIt's critical to acknowledge the principal role of greenhouse gas emissions so that we can rapidly mobilize new solutions, since we are already witnessing in real time the devastating impacts of climate related disasters on businesses, people and the economy,\u201d said Benjamin Houlton, the Ronald P. Lynch Dean of the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and a co-author of the study, \u201cGreater than 99% Consensus on Human Caused Climate Change in the Peer-Reviewed Scientific Literature,\u201d which published Oct. 19 in the journal Environmental Research Letters.\nIn spite of such results, public opinion polls as well as opinions of politicians and public representatives point to false beliefs and claims that a significant debate still exists among scientists over the true cause of climate change. In 2016, the Pew Research Center found that only 27% of U.S. adults believe that \u201calmost all\u201d scientists agreed that climate change is due to human activity, according to the paper. A 2021 Gallup poll pointed to a deepening partisan divide in American politics on whether Earth\u2019s rising observed temperatures since the Industrial Revolution were primarily caused by humans.\n\u201cTo understand where a consensus exists, you have to be able to quantify it,\u201d Lynas said. \u201cThat means surveying the literature in a coherent and non-arbitrary way in order to avoid trading cherry-picked papers, which is often how these arguments are carried out in the public sphere.\u201d\nIn the study, the researchers began by examining a random sample of 3,000 studies from the dataset of 88,125 English-language climate papers published between 2012 and 2020. They found only found four out of the 3,000 papers were skeptical of human-caused climate change. \u201cWe knew that [climate skeptical papers] were vanishingly small in terms of their occurrence, but we thought there still must be more in the 88,000,\u201d Lynas said.\nCo-author Simon Perry, a United Kingdom-based software engineer and volunteer at the Alliance for Science, created an algorithm that searched out keywords from papers the team knew were skeptical, such as \u201csolar,\u201d \u201ccosmic rays\u201d and \u201cnatural cycles.\u201d The algorithm was applied to all 88,000-plus papers, and the program ordered them so the skeptical ones came higher in the order. They found many of these dissenting papers near the top, as expected, with diminishing returns further down the list. Overall, the search yielded 28 papers that were implicitly or explicitly skeptical, all published in minor journals.\nIf the 97% result from the 2013 study still left some doubt on scientific consensus on the human influence on climate, the current findings go even further to allay any uncertainty, Lynas said. \u201cThis pretty much should be the last word,\u201d he said.\nSupport for the Alliance for Science is provided by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\nGet Cornell news delivered right to your inbox.\nCornell Chronicle 120 Maple Ave. Ithaca, NY 14850 cunews@cornell.edu\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Data gathered from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI, formerly the National Climatic Data Center) (figure 1) shows that in a 12 year period from 1998 to 2009, heat has caused the most deaths for 5 out of the 12 years. Although this is not more than half of the years, it comes out number one in more years than any other weather related phenomenon. Looking at the 12 year average however clearly shows that heat comes out ahead of all the other phenomena, with an average of 154 deaths, followed by convection with 129. The only time heat is surpassed by a large margin is with Hurricane Katrina in 2005 where over 1000 people were killed. 1999 saw a peak in heat related fatalities, likely due to the extremely hot summer (Pollina et al., 2013).\nFigure 1. Weather related fatalities from 1998-2009.\nClimate change is a well established scientific fact. The Fifth Assessment Report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change states that \"the science now shows with 95% certainty that human activity is the dominant cause of observed warming since the mid 20th century\". Climate models show that there will be anywhere from a 0.5\u00b0C to just under 4.5\u00b0C increase in global temperatures at the surface by the year 2100 (Cubasch et al. 2013). As temperatures warm in the future, humans will become more susceptible to the effects of extreme heat.\nUrban areas are more likely to suffer from extreme heat due to the urban heat island effect, a well known meteorological phenomenon where urban areas are warmer than the surrounding rural areas due to storage of short wave radiation in the concrete, asphalt, and buildings of the urban setting as opposed to the vegetative nature of the rural areas (Solecki et al. 2005, U.S. EPA 2013). Nighttime temperatures show a more drastic difference between urban and rural areas as opposed to daytime temperatures. For example, temperatures on a calm, cloudless night can be up to 20 degrees cooler at Westhampton Beach, NY than in Central Park, NY, which is located 70 miles east of Central Park. Therefore, extreme heat becomes more of a problem for urban areas, especially so given the fact that the global temperature is expected to continue to increase in the future.\nThe Earth is warming and urban areas will be more at risk for extreme heat, but why even care about heat since we have air conditioning? Air conditioning has become more prevalent in NYC over the decades. In 1970, only about 39% of NYC households had air conditioning. By 1987, that figure increased to 57%. By 2009, close to 88% of all households in NYC has air conditioning (United States Census Bureau). It would seem that with air conditioning becoming more prevalent, we need not worry about heat. That would be true if NYC stood at 100% of all households with air conditioning, but as of 2009, it does not. Some cannot afford it, such as the elderly and those in lower socioeconomic areas. But also, what would happen if a storm Such as Superstorm Sandy occurred in the summer? That could leave potentially millions of people without power and therefore air conditioning, even if 100% of NYC households had air conditioning.\nWhat is a heat wave? There is no standard definition. In 1901, A.T. Burrows defined a heat wave (or as he termed it, hot wave) as 3 or more days in which the maximum temperature in the shade reached or exceeded 90\u00b0F. Robinson et al. (2001) notes that there is a lack of rigorous definition, although he does provide a basic definition as \"it is an extended period of unusually high atmosphere-related heat stress, which causes temporary modification in lifestyle and which may have adverse health consequences for the affected population.\" The Glossary of Meteorology from the National Weather Service defines a heat wave as \"a period of abnormally and uncomfortably hot and usually humid weather\", but does note that it is based on what is normal for a given region of the world. For example, what is warm in Maine is not considered warm in the U.S. Southwest. A locally defined heat wave will be advantageous in many ways. For the public, when a heat wave is forecast, steps can be taken to alleviate heat stress, such as opening cooling centers as is done in NYC when heat advisories or excessive heat warnings are issued. It will also give clarification for the public. In places where there are no locally defined heat waves, the public may be confused as to whether 2 or 3 days constitutes a heat wave. This may not seem like much of a difference, but the prolonged nature of heat waves, which may contain days of excessive heat, can have negative side effects. Epidemiologic analysis conducted by the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene revealed that there is a cumulative impact on consecutive days of extreme heat, with each day adding to the risk of previous days (Metzger 2010). Finally, it would provide a standard definition for local media, especially in a high market area such as NYC, where multiple media outlets could define a heat wave anyway they see fit.\nBecause extreme heat is a major killer and the effects of heat waves (which need to be locally defined) are cumulative, along with the fact that the global temperature is expected to continue and urban areas are warmer than their surrounding rural areas, a heat wave study of NYC is needed. This heat wave study will answer the following questions:\nThe results from this study could be used by forecasters of the local Weather Forecast Office (WFO) of New York, NY (OKX) to better forecast these events. If forecasters are better able to predict the onset of a heatwave, they will be able to alert the public about an impending heat wave, allowing the public to take the necessary precautions to prepare for the heatwave. It will also allow Emergency Managers (EM) to take precautions to keep the p\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

A recent study found that glacial retreat caused the Greenland Ice Sheet to lose one-fifth more mass than previously estimated. Credit: NASA/USGS\nThe Greenland Ice Sheet has shed about one-fifth more ice mass in the past four decades than previously estimated, researchers at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California reported in a new paper. The majority of glaciers on the landmass have retreated significantly, and icebergs are falling into the ocean at an accelerating rate. This additional ice loss has had only an indirect impact on sea levels, but could hold implications for ocean circulation in the future.\nPublished in Nature on Jan. 17, the analysis offers a comprehensive look at retreat around the edges of the entire ice sheet from 1985 to 2022, drawing from nearly a quarter million pieces of satellite data on glacier positions. Of the 207 glaciers in the study, 179 retreated significantly since 1985, 27 held steady, and one advanced slightly.\nZachariae Isstrom, a glacier in northeast Greenland, retreated significantly between 1999 (left) and 2022 (right) as icebergs broke off at an accelerating rate. A recent study found that it lost 176 billion tons (160 billion metric tons) of ice from 1985 to 2022. Credit: NASA/USGS\nMost of the ice loss came from below sea level, in fjords on Greenland\u2019s periphery. Once occupied by ancient glacial ice, many of these deep coastal valleys have filled with seawater \u2013 meaning the ice that broke off made little net contribution to sea level. But the loss likely accelerated the movement of ice flowing down from higher elevations, which in turn added to sea level rise.\n\u201cWhen the ice at the end of a glacier calves and retreats, it\u2019s like pulling the plug out of the fjord, which lets ice drain into the ocean faster,\u201d said Chad Greene, a glacier scientist at JPL and the study\u2019s lead author.\nGet the Latest JPL News\nFor decades researchers have studied the Greenland Ice Sheet\u2019s direct contributions to global sea level rise through ice flow and melting. Scientists participating in the international Ice sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise (IMBIE) estimated that the ice sheet had lost 5,390 billion tons (4,890 billion metric tons) between 1992 and 2020, adding about 0.531 inches (13.5 millimeters) to global mean sea level, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\nBut the IMBIE measurements do not account for ice lost due to the retreat of terminal glaciers along the edges of Greenland. (These glacier edges were already in the water, whether submerged or floating.) The new study quantifies this amount: For the 1985 to 2022 period in the new paper, the ice sheet was estimated to have lost about 1,140 billion tons (1,034 billion metric tons) \u2013 21% more mass lost than in the IMBIE assessment.\nAlthough it doesn\u2019t add to sea levels, the additional ice represents a significant influx of fresh water to the ocean. Recent studies have suggested that changes in the salinity of the North Atlantic Ocean from melting icebergs could weaken the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, part of the global \u201cconveyor belt\u201d of currents that transport heat and salt around the ocean. This could influence weather patterns worldwide, as well as affect ecosystems, the authors said.\nIcebergs have tumbled from Greenland\u2019s glaciers for thousands of years as part of a natural cycle that typically balanced glacier growth in the winter with melting and retreat in the summer. The new study finds that ice retreat has far outpaced growth throughout the 21st century.\nThe researchers also found that Greenland\u2019s ice extent remained relatively steady from 1985 to 2000, then started a marked recession that continues to this day.\nThe data showed a glacier in northeast Greenland called Zachariae Isstrom lost the most ice, dropping 176 billion tons (160 billion metric tons) of mass due to retreat. It was followed by Jakobshavn Isbrae on the western coast, which lost an estimated 97 billion tons (88 billion metric tons), and Humboldt Gletscher in the northwest, which lost 96 billion tons (87 billion metric tons).\nOnly one glacier, Qajuuttap Sermia in southern Greenland, experienced any growth over the study period, but its gains were too small to offset the losses from other glaciers.\nThe researchers also found that glaciers with the largest seasonal fluctuations in the position of their ice front experienced the greatest overall retreat. The correlation suggests the glaciers that are most sensitive to warming each summer will be most impacted by climate change in the coming decades.\nThe discovery of a large-scale pattern of glacier retreat and its link to glacier sensitivity on seasonal time scales was the result of a big-data synthesis that looks at all parts of the ice sheet over time, said JPL cryosphere scientist Alex Gardner, a co-author of the paper. Scientists drew from five publicly available datasets that cumulatively tracked the month-to-month positions of 236,328 glacier edges as detected, either manually or by computer algorithms, in images collected by optical and radar satellites.\n\u201cPreviously, we had bits and pieces \u2013 lots of local studies,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cBut what this study offers is a systematic and comprehensive view that has led to some pretty significant insights that we didn\u2019t have about the ice sheet before.\u201d\nAndrew Wang / Jane J.

Data gathered from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI, formerly the National Climatic Data Center) (figure 1) shows that in a 12 year period from 1998 to 2009, heat has caused the most deaths for 5 out of the 12 years. Although this is not more than half of the years, it comes out number one in more years than any other weather related phenomenon. Looking at the 12 year average however clearly shows that heat comes out ahead of all the other phenomena, with an average of 154 deaths, followed by convection with 129. The only time heat is surpassed by a large margin is with Hurricane Katrina in 2005 where over 1000 people were killed. 1999 saw a peak in heat related fatalities, likely due to the extremely hot summer (Pollina et al., 2013).\nFigure 1. Weather related fatalities from 1998-2009.\nClimate change is a well established scientific fact. The Fifth Assessment Report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change states that \"the science now shows with 95% certainty that human activity is the dominant cause of observed warming since the mid 20th century\". Climate models show that there will be anywhere from a 0.5\u00b0C to just under 4.5\u00b0C increase in global temperatures at the surface by the year 2100 (Cubasch et al. 2013). As temperatures warm in the future, humans will become more susceptible to the effects of extreme heat.\nUrban areas are more likely to suffer from extreme heat due to the urban heat island effect, a well known meteorological phenomenon where urban areas are warmer than the surrounding rural areas due to storage of short wave radiation in the concrete, asphalt, and buildings of the urban setting as opposed to the vegetative nature of the rural areas (Solecki et al. 2005, U.S. EPA 2013).

The multidimensional behavior of flood change across the United States can be described by four distinct groups, with streamgages experiencing (1) minimal change, (2) increasing frequency, (3) decreasing frequency, or (4) increases in all flood properties. Yet group membership shows only weak geographic cohesion. Lack of geographic cohesion is further demonstrated by weak correlations between the temporal patterns of flood change and large\u2010scale climate indices. These findings reveal a complex, fragmented pattern of flood change that, therefore, clouds the ability to make meaningful generalizations about flood change across the United States.\nKeywords: floods, trends, climate\nOne of the first studies to characterize the multidimensional behavior of flood change across the United States\nChanges in frequent floods lacked geographic cohesion, with half of the streamgages experiencing no statistically significant change\nMeaningful generalizations about flood change across the United States remain elusive\nAs the magnitude and intensity of precipitation events increase in many areas world wide [Kunkel et al., 2013], there is a need to understand how these increases translate to changes in observed floods. Whereas changes in the frequency and magnitude of catastrophic floods are of obvious interest for social, ecological, and economic reasons [Bouwer, 2011], changes in the magnitude, duration, and volume of more frequently occurring floods have the potential to adjust alluvial channels and affect the capacity of a channel to contain flood flow [Slater et al., 2015].\nAlmost all studies of long\u2010term global [Kundzewicz et al., 2005] and national [e.g., Lins and Slack, 1999] trends in floods have focused solely on trends in the time series of annual floods\u2014defined as the largest streamflow that occurs in each year of observed record. The use of the annual flood has several important limitations: (1) only trends in the magnitude of the flood can be considered; (2) there is only exactly one event per year, and, therefore, multiple within\u2010year floods are not considered; and (3) the highest flow in a given year may not even be a \u201cflood\u201d using common definitions of flood (e.g., overbank flow); it was merely the largest streamflow observed in that year. It has also been suggested that the focus on annual floods has confounded relations of observed flood changes to large\u2010scale climate indices [Hirsch and Archfield, 2015; Mallakpour and Villarini, 2015] and a peaks\u2010over\u2010threshold (POT)\u2010derived series of flood events could clarify relations between climate and flooding [Hirsch and Archfield, 2015]. A POT\u2010derived time series of flood events includes all daily mean streamflow values that exceed a selected high streamflow value, thereby allowing for the inclusion of multiple high\u2010streamflow events in some years and no events in other years.\nRecent work across Europe [Mediero et al., 2015] and at regional scales [Armstrong et al., 2012, 2014; Mediero et al., 2014; Mallakpour and Villarini, 2015] that employed a POT approach to analyze for trends in both magnitude and frequency of floods have found a limited number of changes in floods with complex patterns of geographic cohesion [Mediero et al., 2015] and, in the central United States, changes to flood frequency but not magnitude [Mallakpour and Villarini, 2015]. No such study has been completed using a POT approach for the conterminous United States nor examined multivariate flood properties.\nThis study examines changes in flood frequency, magnitude, duration, and volume of flood events across the various physiographic and climate regions of the conterminous United States using time series of mean daily streamflow observed at 345 streamgages over the past 70 years (see supporting information for more details) (Figure 1). Floods are then treated as a multidimensional process, where patterns of floods in four dimensions (frequency, peak magnitude, duration, and volume) are evaluated across the United States to find distinct groupings of multidimensional flood behavior. Changes in floods are evaluated relative to a consistent base period in order to address questions such as whether floods are becoming more frequent, longer, or larger (either in peak or volume) (see supporting information for more details).\nStreamgages to assess changes in floods across the United States. Map showing the physiographic regions of the United States [Fenneman and Johnson, 1946] and streamgages that are classified as having minimal development and management of water resources within the contributing watershed. These streamgages have at least 20 years of complete daily streamflow data between water years 1940 to 1969 (the \u201cbase period\u201d), at least 20 years of complete streamflow data from water years 1970 to 2013 (the \u201crecent period\u201d), and at least 5 years of complete streamflow data since water year 1999 (the \u201cvery recent period\u201d).\nOf interest across the United States are regional changes in flood properties. At\u2010site trend evaluations provide information only about one location on a river and, therefore, provide only limited inference about spatial patterns in floods. Regional trends were assessed in the frequency, duration, peak magnitude, and volume of flood events by 400 km by 400 km grid cells across the United States (see supporting information for more details) (Figure 2). The regional trend analysis was limited to areas with a minimum density of long\u2010term reference streamgage records and, in aggregate, these areas encompass about 70% of the land area of the conterminous United States.

Hardened shorelines\u2014those reinforced with artificial structures such as bulkheads and seawalls\u2014can cause shoreline erosion, making the risks of coastal flooding higher over time.12 Impermeable surfaces such as asphalt and concrete can also significantly increase the risk of flooding. When 10 to 20 percent of a watershed has impervious cover, the amount of runoff doubles.13 Short bursts of intense rainfall over major metropolitan areas can rapidly create flash flood conditions that overwhelm sewer systems when trash and debris clog drains.14 For example, a recent October storm in New York City broke three daily rainfall records, triggered numerous flash flood warnings that led to two deaths, left 1,500 residents without electricity, and flooded roads.15\nIn comparison, natural environments and ecosystems such as floodplains can reduce the impacts of flooding by providing natural flood and erosion control and by slowing runoff.16\nFlooding can occur in a variety of ways, and different regions of the United States will experience distinct climate change impacts. In the Northeast, river flooding may become larger and more frequent.17 Meanwhile, the Southwest is expected to experience more drought conditions with flooding expected to become less frequent.18\nThe commonality is how climate change is making flooding events worse. As global temperatures continue to rise, the atmosphere holds more moisture: For every 1-degree Celsius increase in temperature, air can hold 7 percent more moisture.19 More atmospheric moisture leads to more frequent and heavier rainfall over shorter periods of time.\nThe most dangerous type of flooding is flash floods, which happen within minutes or hours of rainfall starting.20 They occur when rainfall is no longer able to be absorbed by the ground due to factors such as drought or the presence of impermeable surfaces such as concrete roads\u2014or when a river dam breaks.21 Forecasting precisely where a relatively small storm may cause flash flooding is difficult because the storm and local hydrological conditions can change rapidly.22 Flash floods claim an average of 100 lives each year in the United States and 5,000 lives globally.23\nRiver flooding, also known as inland flooding, occurs when water levels top river banks following heavy or sustained rainfall from storms and runoff from snowmelt.24 River flooding can happen at any time of the year and anywhere in the country. Sustained rainfall from tropical cyclones and hurricanes has caused disastrous floods, such as in Texas in 2019 during Tropical Storm Imelda and in North Carolina in 2018 during Hurricane Florence.25 And in 2017, human-induced climate change likely increased Hurricane Harvey\u2019s total rainfall by at least 19 percent in the Houston area.26 Warmer temperatures can also lead to more frequent drought conditions and soil that is less able to absorb moisture.27\nRising sea levels and the increasing severity and frequency of hurricanes put coastal communities more at risk.28 Global average sea level has risen 8 to 9 inches since 1880, and that rate is accelerating as ice floes melt and warmer water temperatures cause thermal expansion due to climate change.29 One in 10 Americans live in coastal areas at risk of flooding.30 Ov\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Hardened shorelines\u2014those reinforced with artificial structures such as bulkheads and seawalls\u2014can cause shoreline erosion, making the risks of coastal flooding higher over time.12 Impermeable surfaces such as asphalt and concrete can also significantly increase the risk of flooding. When 10 to 20 percent of a watershed has impervious cover, the amount of runoff doubles.13 Short bursts of intense rainfall over major metropolitan areas can rapidly create flash flood conditions that overwhelm sewer systems when trash and debris clog drains.14 For example, a recent October storm in New York City broke three daily rainfall records, triggered numerous flash flood warnings that led to two deaths, left 1,500 residents without electricity, and flooded roads.15\nIn comparison, natural environments and ecosystems such as floodplains can reduce the impacts of flooding by providing natural flood and erosion control and by slowing runoff.16\nFlooding can occur in a variety of ways, and different regions of the United States will experience distinct climate change impacts.
