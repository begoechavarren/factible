occurring every day around the planet are blamed on mother nature but nothing could be further from the [Music] truth all that is required to understand explain and demonstrate how Decades of global geoengineering development is directly and deliberately responsible for all of the Super Storms hurricanes tornadoes and floods is the understanding of a few simple [Music] Concepts however to find un altered explanations of these Concepts we must first travel back 60 years [Music] rain rain go away come again some other day two young fellas want to play one is Fred he lives in this Farm the other is Pete he lives in the city he's visiting [Music] friend boy where does all this rain come from from the sky everybody knows that [Music] but what Pete really wants to know is how does the water get into the sky well let's see Fred sees one way as the water dries off the horses it goes into the air but there are lots of other ways when the sun comes out strongly after a shower we can almost see the water disappearing into the air [Music] here heat from the Sun is drying the roof water at the top edge of the puddle slowly disappears into the air right before our eyes billions of gallons of water go into the air every hour from the ponds lakes rivers and oceans all over the world in fact everything that dries as giving water to the air even wet Fields do [Music] this and wet clothes on a line slowly lose water to the air and become [Music] dry whether you can see it or whether you can't water is always going into the air from many things even dogs give water to the air as they pant [Music] people as well as animals have to replace the water their bodies give off to the [Music] air yep there's another way water can get into the air the water on the doghouse roof dried pretty fast in the warm sun this this water disappears faster because the stove is hotter this change from water we can see to water vapor we can't see is called [Music] evaporation no that's not evaporation that water isn't changing to water vapor it's just sinking into the soil evaporation comes later the leaves give off water to the air water taken up of the plant's Roots it's hard to believe so let's find out if it's true first a cardboard disc to cover the wet soil then a jar to keep any water vapor from the leaves from being lost to the air and the jar without a [Music] plan and last time until tomorrow [Music] morning during the night the plant gave off water because the jar without the plant is dry inside the jar are droplets just like the droplets that form in the moisture from Fred's warm breath hits the window glass the water vapor changes into very small drops of water because the window is cold in the same way the water vapor from the plant changed to water when it touched the cooler surface of the jar but what happens if the glass is warm the best way to answer such a question is to try [Music] it first a glass is [Music] warm then another glass is chilled [Music] what happens with the warm glass nothing but soon on the cold glass glass water collects water from the air when this happens it's called condensation condensation causes dew on the grass during the night when the earth and grass is cooler than the air condensation takes place and the water vapor forms little drops of water the cloud from the spot of the teac kettle is condensation of the water vapor from the teac kettle hitting the colder air the water vapor in the warm air of the room forms a cloud as it hits the very cold air from the refrigerator [Music] uh-oh now what's going to happen [Music] condensation rain [Music] the hot water in the kettle gives off water vapor to the air by rapid evaporation just as rivers lakes and ponds give off water vapor to the air by slow evaporation as the hot water-filled air hits the colder air near the ice tray the water vapor turns into clouds of tiny water droplets floating in the air condensation when the air is quite cold and cannot hold any more water droplets they collect together to form larger drops as on the ice tray and being too heavy to float in the air they fall back to the Earth as [Music] rain without water in the air we couldn't live our Fields would be dry and nothing would grow because water evaporates in the air and returns again as rain we have water running through the valleys in our Brooks and streams filling reservoirs with water to drink turning our water wheels and turning the turbines and the powerhouses to give us electricity all from water in the air the fundamentals of global geoengineering are no different than this child's experiment water vapor is artificially introduced into the air in place of the natural evaporation stage and is artificially cooled and condensed to produce [Music] rain you need a great many tea kettal to produce the massive amounts of water vapor required to fuel these Global storm systems and this planet is deliberately covered with them [Music] [Music] this artificial precipitation generation is easy to see on infrared satellite and is identified by sudden coordinated bursts of superheated water vapor from no natural source [Music] [Music] ironically the same primary source of CO2 Emissions on this planet is the same source of artificial [Music] precipitation this Nationwide artificial precipitation generation site clickers like clockwork every single day [Music] hexagonal Center of Vortex with flat size proves geoengineering manufacturer nightly Nationwide coordinated artificial precipitation generation Noti is the total absence of natural precipitation before the nightly generation cycle [Music] manufactured vortex in exactly the same area rotating in the opposite direction twin vortices rotating in opposite directions Drive artificial precipitation to the southeast [Music] [Music] [Music] the same identifying cycle of circular and sudden coordinated bursts of artificial precipitation can be seen all around the world in every industrialized and colonized country [Music] in [Music] [Music] [Music] this man-made Global artificial precipitation cycle is the singular reason for massive and continuous flooding worldwide at least nine states with flash flood watches Coast to Coast tonight in Newton North Carolina look at this the water suddenly Rising above the windows of this family's home you can barely see the tops of their cars there and this roadway washed away a giant collapse under the rains today this as we get new information tonight on those two tropical systems big changes there as well we get to it all beginning with the flooding and the pictures just now coming in here's ABC meteorologist Ginger Z tonight chest deep Rescuers pulling people to Safety in Western North Carolina at least 10 Swiftwater rescues already today thanks I just it was raining so hard I did not see like any of that a state of emergency declared in cataba County more than a foot of rain in less than 24 hours busting storm drains and swallowing street signs and mailboxes it's bad it come up fast since 9:00 it probably come up 3T from the drowning Southeast to the wild Southwest that is Albuquerque New Mexico just yesterday near 90 m per hour wind gust sliced through the typically tranquil Town pour down like like a hurricane people plucked from their flooded cars the desert rains swamping the streets near Tucson Arizona the millions of tons of heavy metal nanen trails and frequency activated ice nucleation used to control these storm systems is a topic for another [Music] video however don't believe that mother nature monsoons in the United States or any other fairy tale is responsible for worldwide man-made flooding that you can't see with your own eyes look up",

    "input_prompt": "Claim:\n7.1 billion people are on this planet.\n\nArticle Title:\nWorld Population Estimated at 8 Billion - U.S. Census Bureau\n\nGoogle Search Snippet:\nUsing data from the International Database, the U.S. Census Bureau estimates the world population hit 8 billion on September 26.\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nUsing data from the International Database, the U.S. Census Bureau estimates the world population hit 8 billion on September 26.\nEmphasis on the word estimates.\nThere are many sources of uncertainty in estimating the global population, and it\u2019s unlikely this population milestone was reached on that exact date.\nFor example, the United Nations (U.N.) Population Division estimates the world population reached 8 billion on November 15, 2022.\nOnly around 4% of the world population (all in Africa) lives in a country with very high fertility \u2014 above 5 children per woman. Even in countries with very high fertility, fertility is generally lower than it was in the past.\nWhy the discrepancy? Many of the world\u2019s most populous countries (such as India and Nigeria), haven\u2019t conducted a census in over 10 years, and many countries lack civil registration and vital statistics systems that accurately record births and deaths among their population.\nGiven the lack of precise population data worldwide, the U.N. and Census Bureau estimates are not that far apart, and both imply similar overall trends.\nThe rate of growth peaked decades ago in the 1960s and has been declining since and is projected to continue declining.\nWhile it took 12.5 years for the world to go from 7 billion to 8 billion people, we project it will likely take 14.1 years to go from 8 billion to 9 billion, and another 16.4 years to go from 9 billion to 10 billion.\nDespite a slowdown, we project the world population will reach 10.2 billion by 2060.\nThese broad global trends mask wide diversity. Population growth is the result of fertility, mortality, migration and the share of the population at certain ages. These trends all differ from country to country and, as a result, population growth varies around the world.\nNearly three quarters (74%) of the earth\u2019s population reside in countries where fertility is around or below the replacement level.\nIt is widely believed that 2.1 is the replacement-level fertility rate \u2014 the number of births a woman would need to have in her lifetime to replace herself and the father. However, the precise level of fertility necessary for long-term replacement varies between countries due to different mortality rates.\nAround 33% of the world population \u2014 approximately 1 in 3 people \u2014 lives in a country with a fertility rate close to replacement, including diverse countries such as India, Tunisia and Argentina.\nDemographers once assumed fertility would stop declining once it reached replacement levels. But it has continued to decline below replacement levels in many countries.\nAround 15% of the world\u2019s population lives in a country with low fertility of 1.6 to 1.8 children per woman. This includes a diverse range of countries like Brazil, Mexico, the United States and Sweden.\nAnother 26% \u2014 about 1 in 4 people \u2014 lives in a country with very low fertility at 1.5 children or fewer per woman. Such countries include China, South Korea and Spain.\nAnother 23% lives in a country with moderately high fertility between 2.3 and 5.0 children. This broad category includes a diverse range of countries like Papua New Guinea, Israel and Ethiopia.\nOnly around 4% of the world population (all in Africa) lives in a country with very high fertility \u2014 above 5 children per woman. Even in countries with very high fertility, fertility is generally lower than it was in the past.\nAnd we project that by 2060, no country will have an average of four or more children per woman, let alone five or six children per woman.\nIt\u2019s projected that Benin will have the world\u2019s highest projected total fertility rate (3.8) in 2060. There will, of course, still be women who have four or more children, but it is unlikely entire countries will average four or more children per woman.\nThe world population is projected to keep growing despite declining fertility rates. In fact, we estimate the number of infants already peaked in 2017. Instead, population growth in the future will come from larger groups of people at adult ages. Demographers call this phenomenon population momentum.\nFigure 3 shows the world population by age in 2023 and the projected population by age in 2060. Population growth between now and 2060 will be from the population pyramid \u201cfilling up\u201d previously sparse older age groups, not from growing numbers of births.\nFigure 4 shows how the growth of the older-adult population is projected to make up most of the population growth between now and 2060. Future population growth will be coincident with population aging.\nAs fertility declines, there are proportionally fewer younger people and more older people.\nThe share of the population at young ages has been declining. Today, 32% of people are 19 or younger. By 2060, that number is projected to slip to 26%.\nAs the share of young people declines, the proportion of people at older ages increases. Today, 10% of the world is 65 or older and their share is projected to double to 20% by 2060.\nAs a result, the median age is changing. Today, the global median age is 32 (half the population is younger and half older). By 2060, however, the global median age is projected to climb to 39 years.\nThese general trends vary by country. Niger is the world\u2019s youngest country, with a median age of 15 in 2023. Monaco, by contrast, is the oldest, with a median age of 56 in 2023.\nIn many countries where young-age mortality is already low, gains in life expectancy come from improving conditions at older ages.\nCanada, for instance, did not experience big declines in young-age mortality between 2000 and 2023, but its total life expectancy increased by an average of about 4 years, largely from reduced mortality at older ages.\nFor many other countries, however, life expectancy trends are driven more by dramatic declines in child mortality. In Niger, for example, child mortality declined from around 224 deaths of children under 5 per 1,000 births in 2000 to 103 deaths per 1,\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Population Division estimates the world population reached 8 billion on November 15, 2022.\nOnly around 4% of the world population (all in Africa) lives in a country with very high fertility \u2014 above 5 children per woman. Even in countries with very high fertility, fertility is generally lower than it was in the past.\nWhy the discrepancy? Many of the world\u2019s most populous countries (such as India and Nigeria), haven\u2019t conducted a census in over 10 years, and many countries lack civil registration and vital statistics systems that accurately record births and deaths among their population.\nGiven the lack of precise population data worldwide, the U.N. and Census Bureau estimates are not that far apart, and both imply similar overall trends.\nThe rate of growth peaked decades ago in the 1960s and has been declining since and is projected to continue declining.\nWhile it took 12.5 years for the world to go from 7 billion to 8 billion people, we project it will likely take 14.1 years to go from 8 billion to 9 billion, and another 16.4 years to go from 9 billion to 10 billion.\nDespite a slowdown, we project the world population will reach 10.2 billion by 2060.\nThese broad global trends mask wide diversity. Population growth is the result of fertility, mortality, migration and the share of the population at certain ages. These trends all differ from country to country and, as a result, population growth varies around the world.\nNearly three quarters (74%) of the earth\u2019s population reside in countries where fertility is around or below the replacement level.\nIt is widely believed that 2.1 is the replacement-level fertility rate \u2014 the number of births a woman would need to have in her lifetime to replace herself and the father. However, the precise level of fertility necessary for long-term replacement varies between countries due to different mortality rates.\nAround 33% of the world population \u2014 approximately 1 in 3 people \u2014 lives in a country with a fertility rate close to replacement, including diverse countries such as India, Tunisia and Argentina.\nDemographers once assumed fertility would stop declining once it reached replacement levels. But it has continued to decline below replacement levels in many countries.\nAround 15% of the world\u2019s population lives in a country with low fertility of 1.6 to 1.8 children per woman. This includes a diverse range of countries like Brazil, Mexico, the United States and Sweden.\nAnother 26% \u2014 about 1 in 4 people \u2014 lives in a country with very low fertility at 1.5 children or fewer per woman. Such countries include China, South Korea and Spain.\nAnother 23% lives in a country with moderately high fertility between 2.3 and 5.0 children. This broad category includes a diverse range of countries like Papua New Guinea, Israel and Ethiopia.\nOnly around 4% of the world population (all in Africa) lives in a country with very high fertility \u2014 above 5 children per woman. Even in countries with very high fertility, fertility is generally lower than it was in the past.\nAnd we project that by 2060, no country will have an average of four or more children per woman, let alone five or six children per woman.\nIt\u2019s projected that Benin will have the world\u2019s highest projected total fertility rate (3.8) in 2060. There will, of course, still be women who have four or more children, but it is unlikely entire countries will average four or more children per woman.\nThe world population is projected to keep growing despite declining fertility rates. In fact, we estimate the number of infants already peaked in 2017. Instead, population growth in the future will come from larger groups of people at adult ages. Demographers call this phenomenon population momentum.\nFigure 3 shows the world population by age in 2023 and the projected population by age in 2060. Population growth between now and 2060 will be from the population pyramid \u201cfilling up\u201d previously sparse older age groups, not from growing numbers of births.\nFigure 4 shows how the growth of the older-adult population is projected to make up most of the population growth between now and 2060. Future population growth will be coincident with population aging.\nAs fertility declines, there are proportionally fewer younger people and more older people.\nThe share of the population at young ages has been declining. Today, 32% of people are 19 or younger. By 2060, that number is projected to slip to 26%.\nAs the share of young people declines, the proportion of people at older ages increases.

Monaco, by contrast, is the oldest, with a median age of 56 in 2023.\nIn many countries where young-age mortality is already low, gains in life expectancy come from improving conditions at older ages.\nCanada, for instance, did not experience big declines in young-age mortality between 2000 and 2023, but its total life expectancy increased by an average of about 4 years, largely from reduced mortality at older ages.\nFor many other countries, however, life expectancy trends are driven more by dramatic declines in child mortality. In Niger, for example, child mortality declined from around 224 deaths of children under 5 per 1,000 births in 2000 to 103 deaths per 1,\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

In their note, the ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nUsing data from the International Database, the U.S. Census Bureau estimates the world population hit 8 billion on September 26.\nEmphasis on the word estimates.\nThere are many sources of uncertainty in estimating the global population, and it\u2019s unlikely this population milestone was reached on that exact date.\nFor example, the United Nations (U.N.) Population Division estimates the world population reached 8 billion on November 15, 2022.\nOnly around 4% of the world population (all in Africa) lives in a country with very high fertility \u2014 above 5 children per woman. Even in countries with very high fertility, fertility is generally lower than it was in the past.\nWhy the discrepancy? Many of the world\u2019s most populous countries (such as India and Nigeria), haven\u2019t conducted a census in over 10 years, and many countries lack civil registration and vital statistics systems that accurately record births and deaths among their population.\nGiven the lack of precise population data worldwide, the U.N. and Census Bureau estimates are not that far apart, and both imply similar overall trends.\nThe rate of growth peaked decades ago in the 1960s and has been declining since and is projected to continue declining.\nWhile it took 12.5 years for the world to go from 7 billion to 8 billion people, we project it will likely take 14.1 years to go from 8 billion to 9 billion, and another 16.4 years to go from 9 billion to 10 billion.\nDespite a slowdown, we project the world population will reach 10.2 billion by 2060.\nThese broad global trends mask wide diversity. Population growth is the result of fertility, mortality, migration and the share of the population at certain ages. These trends all differ from country to country and, as a result, population growth varies around the world.\nNearly three quarters (74%) of the earth\u2019s population reside in countries where fertility is around or below the replacement level.\nIt is widely believed that 2.1 is the replacement-level fertility rate \u2014 the number of births a woman would need to have in her lifetime to replace herself and the father. However, the precise level of fertility necessary for long-term replacement varies between countries due to different mortality rates.\nAround 33% of the world population \u2014 approximately 1 in 3 people \u2014 lives in a country with a fertility rate close to replacement, including diverse countries such as India, Tunisia and Argentina.\nDemographers once assumed fertility would stop declining once it reached replacement levels. But it has continued to decline below replacement levels in many countries.\nAround 15% of the world\u2019s population lives in a country with low fertility of 1.6 to 1.8 children per woman. This includes a diverse range of countries like Brazil, Mexico, the United States and Sweden.\nAnother 26% \u2014 about 1 in 4 people \u2014 lives in a country with very low fertility at 1.5 children or fewer per woman. Such countries include China, South Korea and Spain.\nAnother 23% lives in a country with moderately high fertility between 2.3 and 5.0 children. This broad category includes a diverse range of countries like Papua New Guinea, Israel and Ethiopia.\nOnly around 4% of the world population (all in Africa) lives in a country with very high fertility \u2014 above 5 children per woman. Even in countries with very high fertility, fertility is generally lower than it was in the past.\nAnd we project that by 2060, no country will have an average of four or more children per woman, let alone five or six children per woman.\nIt\u2019s projected that Benin will have the world\u2019s highest projected total fertility rate (3.8) in 2060. There will, of course, still be women who have four or more children, but it is unlikely entire countries will average four or more children per woman.\nThe world population is projected to keep growing despite declining fertility rates. In fact, we estimate the number of infants already peaked in 2017. Instead, population growth in the future will come from larger groups of people at adult ages. Demographers call this phenomenon population momentum.\nFigure 3 shows the world population by age in 2023 and the projected population by age in 2060. Population growth between now and 2060 will be from the population pyramid \u201cfilling up\u201d previously sparse older age groups, not from growing numbers of births.\nFigure 4 shows how the growth of the older-adult population is projected to make up most of the population growth between now and 2060. Future population growth will be coincident with population aging.\nAs fertility declines, there are proportionally fewer younger people and more older people.\nThe share of the population at young ages has been declining. Today, 32% of people are 19 or younger. By 2060, that number is projected to slip to 26%.\nAs the share of young people declines, the proportion of people at older ages increases. Today, 10% of the world is 65 or older and their share is projected to double to 20% by 2060.\nAs a result, the median age is changing. Today, the global median age is 32 (half the population is younger and half older). By 2060, however, the global median age is projected to climb to 39 years.\nThese general trends vary by country.

RE is necessary for the amount of water required for agriculture [1], [2], [3] and the forecast of energy production, including hydroelectric power generation and supply stability [4], [5]. Additionally, accurate RE enables preparation for natural disasters such as floods, landslides, and typhoons [6], [7], [8]. Rain gauges, weather radars, automatic weather stations, and satellites have been employed for rainfall observation or estimation. Satellites, however, remain unique for broad area or global rainfall observations [9], [10], [11]. Satellite-based rainfall retrievals are categorized based on observed wavelengths into multichannel visible (VIS)/infrared (IR) sensors or passive microwaves, and based on orbit types into geostationary (GEO) or low Earth orbiting satellites [12]. In particular, GEO meteorological satellites, such as the GEO-KOMPSAT-2A (GK2A) operated by the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA), provide real-time weather information by continuously monitoring atmospheric conditions with a rotation and revolution period synchronized with the Earth\u2019s rotation [13], [14], [15]. Leveraging the Advanced Meteorological Imager (AMI) sensor, GK2A observes 16 spectral bands ranging from VIS to near-IR (NIR) and IR wavelengths [16]. The satellite independently develops and provides 52 geophysical level 2 (L2) products, including cloud detection, sea surface temperatures, and rainfall intensity [17], [18], [19], [20], [21].\nIEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing\nPublished: 2023\n2009 ICCAS-SICE\nPublished: 2009\nAbout IEEE Xplore | Contact Us | Help | Accessibility | Terms of Use | Nondiscrimination Policy | IEEE Ethics Reporting | Sitemap | IEEE Privacy Policy\nA public charity, IEEE is the world's largest technical professional organization dedicated to advancing technology for the benefit of humanity.\n\u00a9 Copyright 2025 IEEE - All rights reserved, including rights for text and data mining and training of artificial intelligence and similar technologies.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The Earth's warming atmosphere can cause hurricanes ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nPublished October 15, 2024\nBy Mary Church, Geoengineering Campaign Manager at the Center for International Environmental Law, and Rossella Recupero, Communications Campaign Specialist at the Center for International Environmental Law\nThis is the first in a multi-part series exposing the threats and risks connected to geoengineering and why these technologies must not be considered effective climate action.\nAs global temperature records continue to be broken month after month and extreme weather events increase in severity as a result of climate change, governments and companies worldwide are increasingly investing in and exploring climate geoengineering as a supposed \u201csolution\u201d to global warming.\nOnce dismissed as science fiction, geoengineering has started to enter mainstream climate discourse. Despite being at odds with international law and subject to a de facto global moratorium, an alarming number of geoengineering field experiments are planned or underway, many driven by voluntary carbon markets.\nBehind the shiny facade of these highly speculative \u201ctechno-fixes,\u201d geoengineering is fraught with risks, uncertainties, and dangers that threaten to delay real climate action and cause more harm than good.\nGeoengineering refers to large or planetary-scale interventions in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, oceans, and land to counteract some of the effects of climate change. These methods range from reflecting sunlight to removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\nCrucially, none tackle the root causes of the climate crisis, the primary driver of which is the production and burning of fossil fuels.\nSRM techniques attempt to reflect sunlight back into space to cool Earth. Methods include releasing large amounts of tiny reflective particles (e.g., sulfur dioxide) into the stratosphere, deploying mirrors in space, or modifying clouds, ice, and plants to make them more reflective.\nCDR techniques theorize removing carbon from the atmosphere on a massive scale. Methods range from sucking carbon straight out of the air to the large-scale burning of trees for energy, capturing and storing the emissions, and even dumping minerals in the ocean or developing monoculture seaweed mega-farms to increase carbon uptake.\nOther theories include slowing ice melt by pumping seawater onto polar and glacial ice to thicken it, spreading billions of tiny reflective beads on the surface of the Arctic or glacial ice to increase its reflectivity, and building a giant curtain in the ocean to block warmer waters.\nGeoengineering technologies do nothing to address the drivers of the climate crisis, and all come with major risks and unknowns. For example, solar geoengineering is inherently unpredictable and risks further destabilizing an already destabilized climate system. Models show that it would have an uneven effect regionally and could exacerbate climate change in countries on the front line of the crisis. What\u2019s more, it carries the risk of \u2018termination shock\u2019 where temperatures suddenly spiral if, for whatever reason, deployment is paused or stopped. Meanwhile, no marine carbon dioxide removal techniques have been proven effective in the long-term removal and storage of CO2, and some could undermine the ocean\u2019s ability to sequester carbon.\nThe illusion that geoengineering can help \u201cfix\u201d climate change is a dangerous distraction from the real solutions to the crisis and risks prolonging fossil fuel dependence. In fact, geoengineering technologies are inherently unpredictable and pose new, significant, unprecedented risks to the fragile ecosystems that sustain life on Earth, which are our best allies in the fight against the crisis. What\u2019s more, relying on the promise of future speculative technologies instead of implementing real solutions today will lead to an overshoot of the critical climate threshold of 1.5\u00baC and lock in catastrophic climate change. By undermining transformative, justice-centered solutions to the climate crisis, geoengineering approaches also risk entrenching inequitable political and social power and perpetuating neocolonialism.\nBy their very nature, it\u2019s impossible to test geoengineering technologies for their intended impact on the climate without large-scale outdoor deployment, by which time any harmful and potentially irreversible impacts would be locked in. Research showing theoretical benefits tends to use highly idealized models underplaying harmful impacts and the likelihood that deployment would not go as planned in the real world. Small-scale outdoor experiments only serve to help develop technology and risk a slippery slope to deployment.\nTo have any chance of their intended impact on the climate geoengineering technologies would have to be deployed at a truly unprecedented scale \u2013 with enormous political, social, and environmental consequences. For example, ocean fertilization and ocean alkalinity enhancement would require approximately 10 percent of the ocean\u2019s surface for a meaningful climate impact. While for SRM to have its intended effect, the Earth would be locked into using these risky technologies for an indeterminate amount of time while emissions were reduced by highly speculative CDR approaches, with so-called \u201cpeak-shaving\u201d scenarios for stratospheric aerosol injection implying deployment of 100- 200 years.\nThe United Nations Human Rights Council\u2019s Advisory Committee has warned that geoengineering technologies \u201ccould seriously interfere with the enjoyment of human rights for millions and perhaps billions of people\u201d \u2013 because of the intended scale of deployment and the inherent risks involved. It has also drawn attention to the disproportionate impact on those who have done the least to cause the climate crisis, including communities in the global South, Indigenous Peoples, peasants, and fisherfolk.\nGeoengineering has been restricted by a de facto moratorium under the Convention on Biological Diversity since 2010.

Despite being at odds with international law and subject to a de facto global moratorium, an alarming number of geoengineering field experiments are planned or underway, many driven by voluntary carbon markets.\nBehind the shiny facade of these highly speculative \u201ctechno-fixes,\u201d geoengineering is fraught with risks, uncertainties, and dangers that threaten to delay real climate action and cause more harm than good.\nGeoengineering refers to large or planetary-scale interventions in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, oceans, and land to counteract some of the effects of climate change. These methods range from reflecting sunlight to removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\nCrucially, none tackle the root causes of the climate crisis, the primary driver of which is the production and burning of fossil fuels.\nSRM techniques attempt to reflect sunlight back into space to cool Earth. Methods include releasing large amounts of tiny reflective particles (e.g., sulfur dioxide) into the stratosphere, deploying mirrors in space, or modifying clouds, ice, and plants to make them more reflective.\nCDR techniques theorize removing carbon from the atmosphere on a massive scale. Methods range from sucking carbon straight out of the air to the large-scale burning of trees for energy, capturing and storing the emissions, and even dumping minerals in the ocean or developing monoculture seaweed mega-farms to increase carbon uptake.\nOther theories include slowing ice melt by pumping seawater onto polar and glacial ice to thicken it, spreading billions of tiny reflective beads on the surface of the Arctic or glacial ice to increase its reflectivity, and building a giant curtain in the ocean to block warmer waters.\nGeoengineering technologies do nothing to address the drivers of the climate crisis, and all come with major risks and unknowns. For example, solar geoengineering is inherently unpredictable and risks further destabilizing an already destabilized climate system. Models show that it would have an uneven effect regionally and could exacerbate climate change in countries on the front line of the crisis. What\u2019s more, it carries the risk of \u2018termination shock\u2019 where temperatures suddenly spiral if, for whatever reason, deployment is paused or stopped. Meanwhile, no marine carbon dioxide removal techniques have been proven effective in the long-term removal and storage of CO2, and some could undermine the ocean\u2019s ability to sequester carbon.\nThe illusion that geoengineering can help \u201cfix\u201d climate change is a dangerous distraction from the real solutions to the crisis and risks prolonging fossil fuel dependence. In fact, geoengineering technologies are inherently unpredictable and pose new, significant, unprecedented risks to the fragile ecosystems that sustain life on Earth, which are our best allies in the fight against the crisis. What\u2019s more, relying on the promise of future speculative technologies instead of implementing real solutions today will lead to an overshoot of the critical climate threshold of 1.5\u00baC and lock in catastrophic climate change. By undermining transformative, justice-centered solutions to the climate crisis, geoengineering approaches also risk entrenching inequitable political and social power and perpetuating neocolonialism.\nBy their very nature, it\u2019s impossible to test geoengineering technologies for their intended impact on the climate without large-scale outdoor deployment, by which time any harmful and potentially irreversible impacts would be locked in. Research showing theoretical benefits tends to use highly idealized models underplaying harmful impacts and the likelihood that deployment would not go as planned in the real world. Small-scale outdoor experiments only serve to help develop technology and risk a slippery slope to deployment.\nTo have any chance of their intended impact on the climate geoengineering technologies would have to be deployed at a truly unprecedented scale \u2013 with enormous political, social, and environmental consequences. For example, ocean fertilization and ocean alkalinity enhancement would require approximately 10 percent of the ocean\u2019s surface for a meaningful climate impact. While for SRM to have its intended effect, the Earth would be locked into using these risky technologies for an indeterminate amount of time while emissions were reduced by highly speculative CDR approaches, with so-called \u201cpeak-shaving\u201d scenarios for stratospheric aerosol injection implying deployment of 100- 200 years.\nThe United Nations Human Rights Council\u2019s Advisory Committee has warned that geoengineering technologies \u201ccould seriously interfere with the enjoyment of human rights for millions and perhaps billions of people\u201d \u2013 because of the intended scale of deployment and the inherent risks involved. It has also drawn attention to the disproportionate impact on those who have done the least to cause the climate crisis, including communities in the global South, Indigenous Peoples, peasants, and fisherfolk.\nGeoengineering has been restricted by a de facto moratorium under the Convention on Biological Diversity since 2010.

Moreover, multiple satellite-based QPE products are offered through different agencies, each with their own specifications, formats and requirements, posing a challenge to understanding the products uncertainties. This manuscript presents a standardized validation system named NPreciSe \u2013 NOAA Satellite-based Precipitation Validation System, which assesses the performance of satellite-based precipitation products in near real-time over the continental United States. NPreciSe is coupled with a user-interactive web platform and built using an open-source software, Python. It is structured to help (1) the end-users determine the best satellite QPE for their specific application, and (2) the algorithm developers identify systematic biases in QPE retrievals. This manuscript presents the capabilities of the NPreciSe, discusses the methodology adopted in developing the standardized validation system, and introduces the web portal.\nSubject terms: Hydrology, Hydrology\nWith the advances in remote-sensing technologies and retrievals, most satellite-based QPEs now provide more than two decades of quasi-global precipitation data with high spatiotemporal resolution, thereby playing a major role in quantifying the global water cycle1, energy budget and water resources overall. Some satellite-based products derived from infrared-based sensors such as Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR) provide QPEs going back to about four decades. The consistent and continuous QPE data record from satellite-based sensors serves as a primary input for weather forecasting, climate and hydrological modeling, data assimilation, natural hazard modeling, and risk assessments2\u20137. Moreover, satellite-based QPEs are the reliable estimates that can fill the gap in in-situ precipitation observations and radar precipitation estimates, especially over the ocean and remote areas8.\nThe US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the Japan Aerospace and Exploration Agency (JAXA), along with their international partner agencies, support a plethora of satellite missions, with active and passive microwave (PMW) sensors to observe the precipitation systems globally with a high spatial and temporal resolution9,10. The satellite constellation consists of PMW sounders and imagers, including sensors such as the Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS11), Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS12), GPM Microwave Imager (GMI13), Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR214) and Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR15) onboard different platforms. Furthermore, geostationary (GEO) satellites such as the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites-R (GOES-R16) series with imagers sensitive to visible and infrared wavelengths supplement the global monitoring of storms. Precipitation retrievals for individual sensors (Level-2) are designed based on specific sensor type, frequency channels, and targeted precipitation type following certain assumptions and methods. For example, both Goddard Profiling (GPROF17,18) and Microwave Integrated Retrieval System (MIRS19\u201321) are used to estimate instantaneous precipitation from PMW sensors but employ different methods. In their current versions, the former uses a fully parametric Bayesian inversion approach while the later inverts the observed radiances based on one-dimensional optimal estimation.\nTo support operational applications in different fields and develop consistent, user-ready precipitation records, instantaneous (Level-2) estimates from individual satellite sensors are often combined to derive the multi-satellite QPE products (Level-3). Examples include the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG22) and Climate Prediction Center morphing method (CMORPH23). Due to assumptions in retrievals and limitations in sensors\u2019 sensitivity, the systematic and random errors associated with Level-2 QPEs propagate to the combined Level-3 products, compromising the application-specific studies24. Thus, given the multiple QPE sources and wide range of applications, understanding the pros and cons of each product is critical for enabling the users of diverse backgrounds to arrive at an informed decision.\nThe International Precipitation Working Group (IPWG) has been stressing the need for a systematic validation for the assessment of existing precipitation products since its formation in the early 2000s25. Several efforts have been conducted to organize high-quality ground observations worldwide to develop an operational and standardized validation system26,27. Kidd and Maggioni28 lists the past and current actions undertaken by the IPWG to build such a system for different regions with spatially dense ground-based observations. The present validation system provides a routine assessment of commonly used satellite precipitation products with a goal of helping users from diverse background to make an informed decision on the choice of precipitation product for their specific applications. For algorithm developers, the system provides near-real-time validation of their product and helps in the identification of any systematic or random retrieval errors.

The consistent and continuous QPE data record from satellite-based sensors serves as a primary input for weather forecasting, climate and hydrological modeling, data assimilation, natural hazard modeling, and risk assessments2\u20137. Moreover, satellite-based QPEs are the reliable estimates that can fill the gap in in-situ precipitation observations and radar precipitation estimates, especially over the ocean and remote areas8.\nThe US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the Japan Aerospace and Exploration Agency (JAXA), along with their international partner agencies, support a plethora of satellite missions, with active and passive microwave (PMW) sensors to observe the precipitation systems globally with a high spatial and temporal resolution9,10. The satellite constellation consists of PMW sounders and imagers, including sensors such as the Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS11), Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS12), GPM Microwave Imager (GMI13), Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR214) and Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR15) onboard different platforms. Furthermore, geostationary (GEO) satellites such as the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites-R (GOES-R16) series with imagers sensitive to visible and infrared wavelengths supplement the global monitoring of storms. Precipitation retrievals for individual sensors (Level-2) are designed based on specific sensor type, frequency channels, and targeted precipitation type following certain assumptions and methods. For example, both Goddard Profiling (GPROF17,18) and Microwave Integrated Retrieval System (MIRS19\u201321) are used to estimate instantaneous precipitation from PMW sensors but employ different methods. In their current versions, the former uses a fully parametric Bayesian inversion approach while the later inverts the observed radiances based on one-dimensional optimal estimation.\nTo support operational applications in different fields and develop consistent, user-ready precipitation records, instantaneous (Level-2) estimates from individual satellite sensors are often combined to derive the multi-satellite QPE products (Level-3). Examples include the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG22) and Climate Prediction Center morphing method (CMORPH23). Due to assumptions in retrievals and limitations in sensors\u2019 sensitivity, the systematic and random errors associated with Level-2 QPEs propagate to the combined Level-3 products, compromising the application-specific studies24. Thus, given the multiple QPE sources and wide range of applications, understanding the pros and cons of each product is critical for enabling the users of diverse backgrounds to arrive at an informed decision.\nThe International Precipitation Working Group (IPWG) has been stressing the need for a systematic validation for the assessment of existing precipitation products since its formation in the early 2000s25.

The present validation system provides a routine assessment of commonly used satellite precipitation products with a goal of helping users from diverse background to make an informed decision on the choice of precipitation product for their specific applications.

Moreover, multiple satellite-based QPE products are offered through different agencies, each with their own specifications, formats and requirements, posing a challenge to understanding the products uncertainties. This manuscript presents a standardized validation system named NPreciSe \u2013 NOAA Satellite-based Precipitation Validation System, which assesses the performance of satellite-based precipitation products in near real-time over the continental United States. NPreciSe is coupled with a user-interactive web platform and built using an open-source software, Python. It is structured to help (1) the end-users determine the best satellite QPE for their specific application, and (2) the algorithm developers identify systematic biases in QPE retrievals.
