Enter your email below, and I'll send you the secrets to giving your body the tools it needs to defend itself and thrive.\nIt is great that more light has been shed on the dangers of consuming too much refined sugar in recent years. Overconsumption of some added sugars can have seriously harmful effects such as weight gain, cardiovascular issues, negative impacts on the skin, increased sugar cravings, mental health-related problems like anxiety and depression, liver disease, pre-diabetes, and more.\nThere is no lack of science to illustrate the damaging effects of consuming too much sugar. A study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition determined a positive association between the regular consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and the rising obesity epidemic. A 2008 study strengthened the argument that sugar may be addictive when its results showed that rodents who were given unlimited access to sugar exhibited multiple signs of addiction.\nAnother study published in The Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology in 2014 acknowledged the potential connection between consuming high glycemic foods and skin issues. Evidence shows that inflammation can have a negative impact on stress levels, and it is known that consuming too much sugar can increase inflammation. Basically, we can all agree that eating too much sugar is bad for your overall health.\nHowever, it is important to understand what type of sugar you are consuming because all sugar is not created equal. These days, it is not uncommon for people to avoid different fruits because of their high sugar content. But natural sugars are not the enemy and, unless you are prediabetic or have a fruit allergy, there is no need to avoid them.\nFruits contain fructose, a form of sugar that is only harmful in high amounts. It is difficult to consume too much fruit, especially since most fruit contains fiber. Fiber slows down the digestion process, allowing the fruit to be an efficient form of energy. Other forms of sugar warrant more of a concern.\nHarmful added sugars typically take the form of sucrose (think table sugar) and high fructose corn syrup which is commonly found in ultra-processed foods. Both of these forms of sugar are a blend of fructose and glucose and are often associated with high fat, high sodium food products that contain lots of unnecessary additives and preservatives. These types of sugar should not be put in the same category as the sugar found in fruit.\nIn my book Eat to Beat Disease, I discuss the impressive powers of pomegranate juice. Pomegranate juice is high in ellagitannins, which are bioactive polyphenols that have been shown to inhibit the growth of prostate cancer. Pomegranate juice has also been shown to encourage the growth of Akkermansia \u2013 a beneficial bacteria that can help to manage the immune system, improve blood glucose metabolism in the body, decrease gut inflammation, and combat obesity. So, pomegranate juice is not only free from the harmful forms of sugar, but it has opposing beneficial effects that combat many of the damaging consequences of \u2018bad\u2019 sugar.\nIf you were to pick up a bottle of 100-percent pure pomegranate juice at the grocery store, you may notice that a standard 8-ounce serving contains upwards of 30 grams of sugar. But look closer and you will see that there are 0 grams of added sugar. That is the key. I do not recommend downing half a bottle of pomegranate juice (or any type of sweet beverage) in one sitting, but it is completely safe and even beneficial to have a serving of it multiple times per week.\nWith that said, just as all sugars are not created equal, neither are all 100-percent juices. Some fruit juices, like orange juice, do not contain as many health benefits and are not as worth their calories and high amounts of sugar \u2013 even if it is natural.\nNext time you are at the grocery store, take a quick look at the levels of sugar in the different 100-percent fruit juices. Think twice about buying juices that are high in calories or have more than one or two ingredients. Be sure to avoid any products that describe \u201cjuice cocktail,\u201d \u201cjuice drink,\u201d or \u201cjuice-flavored beverage\u201d as those are clear indicators that the product contains added sweeteners.\nOct 22, 2025 | Cancer, Lifestyle, Nutrition\nOct 10, 2018 | Exercise\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to cause a broad spectrum of damage to biological systems. Scavenging of ROS is part of a healthy, well-balanced, antioxidant defense system. The present study used the Fenton reaction as a source of hydroxyl radicals and xanthine/xanthine oxidase as a source of superoxide radicals to investigate the scavenging capabilities of various fruit and vegetable juices against these radicals. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spin trapping was used for free radical detection and measurement. Using a colormetric assay, the present study also investigated the protective effects of fruit and vegetable juices against lipid peroxidation induced in cell membranes by hydroxyl radicals. The present study showed that the free radical scavenging capability of each individual juice, but not its ascorbic acid content, is correlated with its protective effect on free radical induced lipid peroxidation. The results indicate that ascorbic acid is only one facet of the protective effect of fruit and vegetable juices. It appears that consumption of whole fruits and vegetables would be superior to an ascorbic acid supplement for antioxidant effectiveness.\nRecent reports have indicated a need for increased dietary intake of ascorbic acid as a source for antioxidants [1,2]. One proposed method to increase ascorbic acid (vitamin C) intake is to ingest it as a supplemental tablet. However, studies have shown that vitamin C marketed as a dietary supplement may also act as a pro-oxidant [3] and may even react with iron to cause a cycle of hydroxyl radical (\u2022OH) production [4]. Two laboratories have described the antioxidant capacity of fruits, in general [5,] and apples, specifically [6], by measuring total antioxidant capacities.\nReactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to play important roles in carcinogenesis by directly damaging DNA and acting as tumor promoters [7,8]. ROS include, but are not limited to, \u2022OH and superoxide radical (O2\u2212\u2022) and hydrogenperoxide (H2O2). ROS-mediated reactions are believed to be involved in various pathogenic processes [7\u20139]. Initiation of diseases can be associated with an imbalance caused by an excessive generation of ROS, resulting in oxidative stress.\nUsing electron spin resonance (ESR), the present study investigated the antioxidant properties of fruits and vegetable juices against specific radical types, \u2022OH and O2\u2212\u2022 radicals. The present study also determined the ability of these natural foods to protect against lipid peroxidation caused by ROS. These radicals are highly reactive and other studies have shown that they can cause cellular injury through various mechanisms, such as DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, and activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) signaling pathways [10,11]. The present study also measured the ascorbic acid contents of various natural food juices and attempted to correlate their ascorbic acid levels with their abilities to quench specific radicals and to protect cell membranes from ROS-induced damage.\nSeveral varieties of fresh fruits and vegetables were obtained from Kroger, Inc. The fruits and vegetables were washed with a mild detergent and rinsed with distilled/deionized water (dH2O) to remove possible pesticide and preservative residues. Fruit and vegetable samples were obtained by excising 100 mg of skin and pulp, crushing it, and homogenizing the sample on ice with a \u201ctissue tearor\u201d (Biospec Products, Racine, WI). Each sample was diluted to 1.0 ml with dH2O, homogenized again, and filtered through a nitrocellulose membrane (pore size, 0.45 \u03bcm) in order to yield the juice.\nESR spin trapping was used to detect short-lived free radical intermediates [12]. This technique involved the addition-type reaction of a short-lived radical with a paramagnetic compound (spin trap) to form a relatively long-lived free radical product (spin adduct), which was then studied using conventional ESR. The intensity of the signal was used to measure the amount of short-lived radicals trapped. The hyperfine couplings of the spin adduct were generally characteristic of the original trapped radicals.\nSpin trapping is a method of choice for detection and identification of free radical generation, owing to its specificity and sensitivity. Hyperfine couplings were measured (to 0.1 G) directly from magnetic field separation using potassium tetraperoxochromate (K3CrO8) and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) as reference standards.\nThe relative radical concentration was estimated by multiplying half of the peak height by (\u0394Hpp)2, where \u0394Hpp represents peak-to-peak width. A SPEX 300 program (U.S. EPR, Clarksville, MD) was used for data acquisition and analyses. Both \u2022OH and O2\u2212\u2022 radicals were measured by ESR (Model ESP 300E, Bruker Instruments, Billerica, MA), using a flat cell assembly with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) as a spin trap. Hydroxyl radicals were generated by the Fenton reaction (Fe(II) + H2O2 \u2192 Fe(III) + OH\u2212 + \u2022OH). Superoxide radicals were generated by xanthine/xanthine oxidase. For \u2022OH measurement, spectra were taken 3 min after reaction initiation; for O2\u2212\u2022 measurement, the spectra were recorded 1 min after reaction initiation. All experiments were performed at room temperature in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) that had been purified by filtration through Chelex 100 resin (Sigma Chemical Co, St. Louis, MO).\nLipid peroxidation of RAW 264.7 mouse peritoneal monocytes was measured by a colormetric assay for lipid peroxidation products (LPO-586 kit, Oxis International Inc. Portland, OR). A typical reaction mixture contained FeSO4 (0.1 mM) + H2O2 (1 mM) and 1 \u00d7 107 cells in a total volume of 1.0 ml of PBS (pH 7.4). Fruit and vegetable juices were added (100 mg/ml) to this mixture to measure their effect on lipid p\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Chan School of Public Health researchers and colleagues.\nFor the meta-analysis, published January 16, 2024, in JAMA Pediatrics, the researchers looked at 42 studies: 17 of children and 25 of adults. They found that among children, each additional daily serving of 100% fruit juice was associated with a 0.03 higher body mass index (BMI), and among adults, a 0.02 change.\nThe researchers noted in a January 16 CNN article that a standard serving of juice is four ounces, but many people drink much more than that. Drinking large amounts of fruit juice can be unhealthy because it is metabolized differently than whole fruit, which contains fiber.\n\u201cHow often do we eat three oranges? Yet, a glass of OJ is about three oranges that can be consumed in a minute or two, and we can go back and have another, and that will add many calories and lead to a spike in blood glucose,\u201d study co-author Walter Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition, said in the article.\nRead the CNN article: Weight gain in children and adults linked to 100% fruit juice, study says\nStay connected with Harvard Chan School\nIn addition to our degree programs, we offer highly targeted executive and continuing education, directed and taught by Harvard faculty.\nStay connected with newsletters on climate, nutrition, communication \u2014 and the latest from Harvard Chan School.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

We examined whether 100% fruit juice consumption was associated with weight change in a large prospective cohort of postmenopausal women. We analyzed data from 49,106 postmenopausal women in the United States enrolled in the Women\u2019s Health Initiative between 1993 and 1998. Food frequency questionnaires at baseline and year 3 assessed food and beverage intake. Body weight was measured at in-person clinic visits. We used multivariable linear regression to determine the association between change in 100% fruit juice consumption and 3-year weight change over the same time. Covariates of interest included age, demographic factors, smoking, body mass index, hormone replacement therapy, lifestyle factors, change in whole fruit intake, and change in sugar-sweetened beverage intake. The mean weight change was 3.2 lbs. over 3 years. In multivariable adjusted analyses, each 1 serving/day increase in 100% fruit juice intake was associated with a 3-year weight gain of 0.39 lbs. (95% confidence interval: 0.10, 0.69). In conclusion, an increase in 100% fruit juice consumption was associated with a small amount of long-term weight gain in postmenopausal women.\nAmerican adults gain an average of 1 pound (lb.) per year, and it is a public health priority to determine which foods and beverages contribute most to this gradual weight gain.1 Two analyses of the Nurses Health Studies (NHS) I and II and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS) found that each 1 serving/day (1 small glass, about 6 oz.) increase in 100% fruit juice consumption was independently associated with gaining 0.31\u20130.49 lbs. over 4 years.1,2 We know of no other prospective studies on this topic in adults.3 Our objective was to confirm whether an increase in 100% fruit juice consumption is associated with weight gain in the Women\u2019s Health Initiative (WHI), which is a large prospective study of postmenopausal American women.\nThe design and methods of the WHI have been described elsewhere.4 Between 1993\u20131998, 122,970 postmenopausal women ages 50\u201379 years were enrolled into the WHI Observational Study and the comparison arm of the Dietary Modification Clinical Trial (participants received no dietary intervention). After excluding participants with missing baseline weight (n=388), year 3 weight (n=20,016), baseline 100% fruit juice intake (n=129), year 3 100% fruit juice intake (n=25,291), baseline age > 65 years (n=18,730), body mass index > 35.0 kg/m2 (n=6685), and implausible energy intake (n=2425), 49,106 participants remained for inclusion in this study (Supplemental Table A1). Institutional review boards at each WHI site approved the study protocol, and all participants provided written informed consent.\nThe primary exposure was the change in daily 100% fruit juice consumption, measured at baseline and year 3 by a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire designed for the WHI and validated for measuring changes in diet over time.5 Participants were asked about their usual serving size (3 oz., 6 oz., or 12 oz.) and frequency of consuming all types of 100% fruit juice. Total daily 100% fruit juice consumption was estimated by multiplying the serving size by frequency. One serving of 100% fruit juice was defined as 6 oz.\nThe primary outcome was 3-year weight change. Study personnel measured body weight using a standardized protocol and calibrated scales. Twelve covariates of interest were assessed and included in the final models: baseline age, education level (11 levels), total household income (9 levels), race/ethnicity, baseline current smoking, baseline body mass index (BMI), baseline hormone replacement therapy status, baseline recreational physical activity level (MET-hours/week), study arm, change in the Healthy Eating Index diet quality score,6 change in whole fruit intake, and change in sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) intake. Adjustment for change in total energy intake, a mediator in the relationship between change in 100% fruit juice consumption and weight change, was included as a thirteenth covariate of interest in a separate model. Fruit juice, whole fruit, and SSB intake was standardized to 2000 kilocalories/day using the residual method.7\nWe created a linear mixed effects model to determine the association of each one serving/day increase in 100% fruit juice consumption with weight change during the same 3-year study period. Because age and BMI may modify the relationship between change in 100% fruit juice intake and long-term weight gain, we performed subgroup analyses of 5-year increments of baseline age and baseline BMI category (normal [18.5\u201324.9 kg/m2], overweight [25.0\u201329.9 kg/m2], and class I obesity [30.0\u201334.9 kg/m2]). We also created interaction terms between change in 100% fruit juice intake and (1) baseline age, and (2) BMI (both as continuous variables), and tested each interaction term in the adjusted linear mixed model. Finally, we conducted a sensitivity analysis using multiple imputation to estimate missing exposure data from 25,291 participants with missing year 3 exposure data for 100% fruit juice, sugar-sweetened beverages, or whole fruit. All tests were two-sided and P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Data were analyzed using Stata (version 14, StataCorpLP, College Station, Texas).\nOn average, included women at baseline were 58 years old, had a BMI of 26.2 kg/m2, were predominantly white, did not smoke, and consumed less than 1 serving/day of 100% fruit juice (Table 1). Compared to included participants, participants who were excluded due to missing data were more likely to be African American or Latino, less likely to have a college degree, and less likely to use postmenopausal hormones (Supplemental Table A2). On average included participants gained 3.2 lbs. over 3 years. Estimated weight \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",
