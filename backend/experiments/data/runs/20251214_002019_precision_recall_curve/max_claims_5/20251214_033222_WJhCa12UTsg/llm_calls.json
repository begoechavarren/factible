    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nIt's 6:00 in the morning, pitch black outside. My 14-year-old son is fast asleep in his bed. I flip on the light and physically shake the poor boy awake. because I know that, like ripping off a Band-Aid, it's better to get it over with quickly. Sound brutal, but perhaps familiar? Every morning I ask myself, how can I, knowing what I know, be doing this to my own son? You see, I\u2019m a sleep researcher. So I know that I\u2019m depriving my son of sleep he desperately needs as a rapidly growing teenager. I also know that by waking him up hours before his natural biological clock tells him he\u2019s ready, I\u2019m literally robbing him of the type of sleep most associated with learning, memory consolidation, and emotional processing. But it's not just my kid that's being deprived of sleep. Sleep deprivation among American teenagers is an epidemic. Only about 1 in 10 gets the 8 to 10 hours of sleep per night recommended by sleep scientists and pediatricians. The major factor preventing teens from getting the sleep they need is a matter of public policy. Across the country, many schools are starting around 7:30 a.m. or earlier, despite the fact that major medical organizations recommend that middle and high schools start no earlier than 8:30 a.m. These early start policies have a direct effect on how little sleep American teenagers are getting. They\u2019re also pitting teenagers in a fundamentally unwinnable fight against their own bodies. Around the time of puberty, teenagers experience a delay in their biological clock, which determines when we feel most awake and when we feel most sleepy. This is driven in part by a shift in the release of the hormone melatonin. Teenagers\u2019 bodies wait to start releasing melatonin until around 11 p.m., which is two hours later than what we see in adults or younger children. This means that waking a teenager up at 6 a.m. is the biological equivalent of waking an adult up at 4 a.m. Now, on the unfortunate days when I have to wake up at 4 a.m., I\u2019m a zombie. Functionally useless. I can't think straight. I\u2019m irritable, and I probably shouldn\u2019t be driving a car. But this is how many American teenagers feel every single school day. Many of the, shall we say, unpleasant characteristics that we chalk up to being a teenager\u2014 moodiness, irritability, laziness, depression\u2014 could be a product of chronic sleep deprivation. For many teens battling chronic sleep loss, their go-to strategy to compensate is consuming large quantities of caffeine in the form of venti Frappuccinos, or energy drinks and shots. So essentially, we've got an entire population of tired but wired youth. Advocates of sleep-friendly start times know that adolescence is a period of dramatic brain development, particularly in the parts of the brain that are responsible for those higher order thinking processes, including reasoning, problem solving, and good judgment. In other words, the very type of brain activity that\u2019s responsible for reining in those impulsive and often risky behaviors that are so characteristic of adolescence. They know that, like the rest of us, when teenagers don\u2019t get the sleep they need, their brains, their bodies, and behavior suffer. They can't concentrate. Their attention plummets, and many will even show behavioral signs that mimic ADHD. But the consequences of teen sleep loss go well beyond the classroom, sadly contributing to many of the mental health problems that skyrocket during adolescence. In our work with teens from LA Unified School District, we found that teens with sleep problems were 55% more likely to have used alcohol in the past month. In another study with over 30,000 high school students, they found that for each hour of lost sleep, there was a 38% increase in feeling sad or hopeless, and a 58% increase in teen suicide attempts. And if that's not enough, teens who skimp out on sleep are at increased risk for a host of physical health problems that plague our country, including obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. Then there\u2019s the risk of putting a sleep-deprived teen behind the wheel. Studies have shown that getting five hours or less of sleep per night is the equivalent of driving with a blood alcohol content above the legal limit. Researchers in this area have produced tremendous science showing the benefits of later start times. The findings are unequivocal. Teens from districts with later start times get more sleep. They're more likely to show up for school. School absences dropped by 25% in one district, and they're less likely to drop out. Not surprisingly, they do better academically. Standardized test scores in math and reading go up by 2 to 3 percentage points. That's as powerful as reducing class sizes by one third fewer students. Their mental and physical health improves, and their families are happier. Even their communities are safer because car crash rates go down\u2014 a 70% reduction in one district. Now, given these tremendous benefits, you might think, well, this is a no brainer, right? So why have we as a society failed to heed this call? Delaying start times presents many logistical challenges. Updating bus routes, increased transportation costs, impact on sports. Care before or after school. But these are problems we have to work through. They are not valid excuses for failing to do the right thing for our children, which is to start middle and high schools no earlier than 8:30 a.m. Districts around the country, big and small, who have made this change, they\u2019ve found that these fears are often unfounded and far outweighed by the tremendous benefits for our student health and performance and our collective public safety.",

We argue that this sleep deprivation is due in part to pubertal changes in the homeostatic and circadian regulation of sleep. These changes promote a delayed sleep phase that is exacerbated by evening light exposure and incompatible with aspects of modern society, notably early school start times. In this review of human and animal literature, we demonstrate that delayed sleep phase during puberty is likely a common phenomenon in mammals, not specific to human adolescents, and we provide insight into the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon.\nKey Words: Puberty, Chronotype, Entrainment, Sleep deprivation\nA recent poll by the National Sleep Foundation found that over 45% of adolescents in the United States obtain inadequate sleep [1]. At the root of this chronic sleep deprivation is the adolescent tendency to stay up late. Teenagers maintain later bedtimes than younger adolescents, even when wake up times are constrained by school or work [2,3,4,5,6]. This delayed timing of sleep is popularly attributed to many external influences, ranging from evening work to social opportunities [7]. Current evidence demonstrates, however, that social factors cannot completely account for the adolescent delayed sleep onset typical of an evening chronotype.\nThe developmental timing of the adolescent transition into a more evening chronotype suggests physiological underpinnings. Girls begin to show a delay in the timing of sleep 1 year earlier than boys, paralleling their younger pubertal onset. Maximum delay also occurs earlier in girls (19.5 vs. 20.9 years), and the magnitude of the peak delay is sexually differentiated [5]. In other cultures, similar developmental timing is observed, although the peak delay may occur as early as 15\u201316 years of age [1,2,3,4,5,6]. Importantly, a delay in the timing of sleep during the second decade of life has been observed in over 16 countries on 6 continents, in cultures ranging from pre-industrial to modern (as reviewed in [8]). Although most studies have been cross-sectional, retrospective longitudinal measures confirm that the timing of sleep is delayed during adolescence [5].\nAdolescents continue to show a delayed circadian (or internal clock) phase as indicated by daily endocrine rhythms even after several weeks of regulated schedules that allow for sufficient sleep. This delay is maintained under controlled laboratory conditions in which there is limited possibility for social influence [7, 9]. Moreover, both home-based and laboratory studies of adolescents show that delayed circadian phase correlates with secondary-sex development [7, 10, 11]. This correlation holds true for subjective ratings of chronotype and puberty even when grade level in school is held constant [11]. If we assume that teenagers attending the same grade in school are exposed to a similar social environment, this evidence suggests that a biological component drives adolescent changes in sleep patterns.\nIf physiologic processes drive adolescent sleep patterns, then we would expect that other mammalian species might show similar changes in the timing of sleep and activity around the development of sexual maturation. To test this hypothesis, we reviewed data from nine studies that examined the daily rhythms of mammals during pubertal development [12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20]. We inferred the timing of puberty by referencing universal markers (the initiation of spermatogenesis and ovulation) discussed in previously published reproductive studies for each species [21,22,23,24,25]. We defined puberty as the age interval between the first indication of secondary-sex development and the achievement of reproductive competency.\nThis review found evidence for delayed circadian phase during puberty in all five species studied: Macaca mulatta (rhesus macaque [12]), Octodon degus (degu [13,14,15,16]), Rattus norvegicus (laboratory rat [16, 17]), Mus musculus (laboratory mouse [18, 19]), and Psammomys obesus (fat sand rat [20]). Overall, this evidence indicated that the delayed timing of sleep during human adolescence is likely to represent a developmental change common across mammalian species (table 1).\nA delay in circadian phase has been observed around the time of puberty in six mammalian species\nSeveral themes emerged while comparing different species. The first concerned the magnitude of the phase delay: with the exception of fat sand rats maintained under short, winter-like photoperiods [20], all other species and all experimental conditions provided evidence for a 1- to 4-hour delay in circadian rhythms during puberty. This phenomenon was replicable and observed independently by six different laboratories (table 1). The daily rhythms measured were diverse and included behavioral rhythms, such as sleep and activity, and physiological rhythms, such as endocrine and metabolic rhythms.\nThe magnitude of the delay in humans was sexually differentiated as seen for example in a large epidemiological study performed in Germany and Switzerland, where men showed greater changes in chronotype across adolescence and young adulthood than women [5]. Similarly, male degus and rats showed pronounced changes in the timing of peak activity across puberty, whereas females produced smaller changes in the timing of activity onset or offset [16]. These sex differences may be due to a sexual differentiation of the phenomenon itself or to a masking of the phenomenon by the estrogenic phase advance of rhythms around the time of ovulation [26].\nThe delay in several species was accompanied by an increase in crepuscularity, or activity around the transition times of dawn and dusk. In well-rested human subjects, adolescents showed a decreased propensity to fall asleep in the evening hours [27], as well as an increase in midday sleepiness as measured by the multiple-sleep latency test [28]. In the degu and rat, similar trends were\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a starting time of 8:30 a.m. or later.\n\nFull Page Content:\nAs schools across the country continue to struggle with the academic and mental wellness fallout of the pandemic, many educators and district administrators are rethinking some of the mainstays that have defined public schools for decades, including homework, technology, and the length of the school day and week.\nOne potential change that generated momentum even before the pandemic is later school start times. According to the most recent federal data (2017-18), U.S. public high schools began their day at 8:00 a.m., on average. Forty-two percent of schools started earlier, including 10 percent\u2014predominantly suburban schools\u2014before 7:30 a.m.\nThese start times are too early, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). Middle and high schools should start at 8:30 a.m. or later to give students the opportunity to get the sleep they need.\nOver the past decade, a consensus formed among researchers that later school times would benefit student sleep patterns, which would enable them to walk into class more alert and more prepared for learning. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends teenagers, ages 13 to 18, should regularly sleep 8 to 10 hours per night for good health. Students without enough sleep are more likely to suffer from symptoms of depression, perform poorly in school, and not engage in daily physical activity.\nProponents believe the post-COVID school climate makes a shift to later school start times even more urgent. With stress and mental health challenges on the rise, later start times are seen as a relatively pain-free step in making schools healthier and happier places for students.\nStill, later school start times can have ripple effects in school districts and the impact will not be felt equally by all students, families, and educators. Addressing these potential drawbacks and listening to all stakeholders is critical, experts say, before districts take this step.\nThe existing research makes a compelling case that changing school start times can encourage healthier sleep. A 2018 study that looked at two public schools in Seattle found that students\u2019 sleep increased an average of 34 minutes each night after start times were moved nearly an hour later.\nStudents' academic performance, at least in the biology course that was the focus of the study, also improved. Among students whose start times were delayed, final grades were 4.5 percent higher, compared with students who took the class when school started earlier.\n\"School start time has serious implications for how students learn and perform in their education....To ask a teen to be up and alert at 7:30 a.m. is like asking an adult to be active and alert at 5:30 a.m.,\" said Horacio de la Iglesia, who co-authored the study. \u201cAdolescents are on one schedule. The question is: What schedule will their schools be on?\u201d\nAnother recent study painted a more modest picture of the academic benefits. In 2021, researchers at the University of Minnesota looked at 18,000 students in grades 5 through 11 after four school districts postponed the start of their school day by 20 to 65 minutes. Students\u2019 grade point averages increased by a modest 0.1 points, on average. While the researchers categorized the sleep benefits as \"large,\" the academic improvements were considered \"small.\"\nBut what do we know about the effect of later start times on educators? In 2022, researchers found that middle and high school teachers at a suburban school district in Colorado felt less stressed and more rested three years after the high schools started 70 minutes later and the middle school began 40-60 minutes later.\n\"Later secondary school start times is a significant policy shift that not only improves the health and well-being of adolescents, but can also equalize healthy sleep duration for all K-12 teachers,\" the researchers concluded.\nLike the Colorado district evaluated by this study, districts may need to move elementary school start times earlier to accommodate later times among middle and especially high schools. Staggering these start times can alleviate the potential logistical complications of this transition\u2014particularly in areas where the number of school buses is limited.\nLater start time initiatives focus on middle and high school students because that is the age group more susceptible to the ill effects of inadequate sleep. A study released in October by the American Educational Research Association found that early school start times do not have a discernible negative impact on elementary school students.\n\"We found earlier start times for elementary schoolers do not have the same negative effects as they do for middle and high schoolers,\" said study co-author Sarah Crittenden Fuller, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \"Moving elementary schools to earlier start times is unlikely to harm the educational outcomes of these younger students.\" (Similarly, the study in Colorado on teacher impact reported no ill effects on elementary educators after their schools implemented an earlier start time.)\nFuller and her colleagues also noted that school start times have the largest impact on traditionally disadvantaged groups and that those groups are most likely to be affected by the disruption of a later start time.\n\u201cTo the extent that districts can change start times to bring middle and high school start times in line with the science on adolescent sleep, this may help close achievement gaps,\u201d said Fuller. \u201cIn addition, traditionally disadvantaged groups may benefit most from supports that schools and districts can provide to address disruptions in childcare and transportation created by a change in start times.\u201d\nThose potential disruptions will be monitored in California, where in 2019 lawmakers passed a law mandating districts not begin public high school any earlier than 8:30 a.m. and middle school earlier than 8 a.m. The law went into effect in September, affecting roughly 3 million students.\nLat\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Addressing these potential drawbacks and listening to all stakeholders is critical, experts say, before districts take this step.\nThe existing research makes a compelling case that changing school start times can encourage healthier sleep. A 2018 study that looked at two public schools in Seattle found that students\u2019 sleep increased an average of 34 minutes each night after start times were moved nearly an hour later.\nStudents' academic performance, at least in the biology course that was the focus of the study, also improved. Among students whose start times were delayed, final grades were 4.5 percent higher, compared with students who took the class when school started earlier.\n\"School start time has serious implications for how students learn and perform in their education....To ask a teen to be up and alert at 7:30 a.m. is like asking an adult to be active and alert at 5:30 a.m.,\" said Horacio de la Iglesia, who co-authored the study. \u201cAdolescents are on one schedule. The question is: What schedule will their schools be on?\u201d\nAnother recent study painted a more modest picture of the academic benefits. In 2021, researchers at the University of Minnesota looked at 18,000 students in grades 5 through 11 after four school districts postponed the start of their school day by 20 to 65 minutes. Students\u2019 grade point averages increased by a modest 0.1 points, on average. While the researchers categorized the sleep benefits as \"large,\" the academic improvements were considered \"small.\"\nBut what do we know about the effect of later start times on educators? In 2022, researchers found that middle and high school teachers at a suburban school district in Colorado felt less stressed and more rested three years after the high schools started 70 minutes later and the middle school began 40-60 minutes later.\n\"Later secondary school start times is a significant policy shift that not only improves the health and well-being of adolescents, but can also equalize healthy sleep duration for all K-12 teachers,\" the researchers concluded.\nLike the Colorado district evaluated by this study, districts may need to move elementary school start times earlier to accommodate later times among middle and especially high schools. Staggering these start times can alleviate the potential logistical complications of this transition\u2014particularly in areas where the number of school buses is limited.\nLater start time initiatives focus on middle and high school students because that is the age group more susceptible to the ill effects of inadequate sleep. A study released in October by the American Educational Research Association found that early school start times do not have a discernible negative impact on elementary school students.\n\"We found earlier start times for elementary schoolers do not have the same negative effects as they do for middle and high schoolers,\" said study co-author Sarah Crittenden Fuller, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \"Moving elementary schools to earlier start times is unlikely to harm the educational outcomes of these younger students.\" (Similarly, the study in Colorado on teacher impact reported no ill effects on elementary educators after their schools implemented an earlier start time.)\nFuller and her colleagues also noted that school start times have the largest impact on traditionally disadvantaged groups and that those groups are most likely to be affected by the disruption of a later start time.\n\u201cTo the extent that districts can change start times to bring middle and high school start times in line with the science on adolescent sleep, this may help close achievement gaps,\u201d said Fuller. \u201cIn addition, traditionally disadvantaged groups may benefit most from supports that schools and districts can provide to address disruptions in childcare and transportation created by a change in start times.\u201d\nThose potential disruptions will be monitored in California, where in 2019 lawmakers passed a law mandating districts not begin public high school any earlier than 8:30 a.m. and middle school earlier than 8 a.m. The law went into effect in September, affecting roughly 3 million students.\nLat\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

According to the most recent federal data (2017-18), U.S. public high schools began their day at 8:00 a.m., on average. Forty-two percent of schools started earlier, including 10 percent\u2014predominantly suburban schools\u2014before 7:30 a.m.\nThese start times are too early, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). Middle and high schools should start at 8:30 a.m. or later to give students the opportunity to get the sleep they need.\nOver the past decade, a consensus formed among researchers that later school times would benefit student sleep patterns, which would enable them to walk into class more alert and more prepared for learning. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends teenagers, ages 13 to 18, should regularly sleep 8 to 10 hours per night for good health. Students without enough sleep are more likely to suffer from symptoms of depression, perform poorly in school, and not engage in daily physical activity.\nProponents believe the post-COVID school climate makes a shift to later school start times even more urgent.
