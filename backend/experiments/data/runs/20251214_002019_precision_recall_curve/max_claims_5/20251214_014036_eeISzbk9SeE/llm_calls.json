These events and events influenced by climate change, such as wildfires, continue to cause significant human morbidity and mortality and adversely affect mental health and well-being. Although adverse health impacts from extreme events declined over the past few decades, climate change and more people moving into harm\u2019s way could alter this trend. Long-term changes to Earth\u2019s energy balance are increasing the frequency and intensity of many extreme events and the probability of compound events, with trends projected to accelerate under certain greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. While most of these events cannot be completely avoided, many of the health risks could be prevented through building climate-resilient health systems with improved risk reduction, preparation, response, and recovery. Conducting vulnerability and adaptation assessments and developing health system adaptation plans can identify priority actions to effectively reduce risks, such as disaster risk management and more resilient infrastructure. The risks are urgent, so action is needed now.\nKeywords: climate change, climate variability, extreme events, population health, health systems\nWorldwide, in 2019, there were 396 disasters1 that killed 11,755 people, affected 95 million others, and cost nearly US$130 billion (28). Asia was the most affected continent with 40% of the events, 45% of the deaths, and 74% of all people affected. Floods and storms accounted for 68% of the number of affected people worldwide. Anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, land use change, and other activities impacting the global energy balance are altering the frequency and intensity of many extreme weather and climate events, with some regions experiencing increases in heat waves, floods, and droughts (84). Events influenced by climate change, particularly wildfires, also are increasing.\nRisks from extreme weather and climate events arise from the intersection of the physical hazard (e.g., wind and rain), the extent of exposure to the hazard, the vulnerability of individuals and communities, and the capacity to prepare for, manage, and recover from extreme events.\nA disaster generally is defined as a sudden, calamitous event that disrupts the functioning of a community or society and that exceeds its ability to cope using its own resources (81). The occurrence of an extreme event is not required for a community or region to experience extreme impacts, such as large increase in mortality; an extreme impact can arise from a moderately strong event when it occurs in a highly vulnerable population. The converse also is true, that an extreme event may not result in extreme impacts when communities are prepared.\nRoughly 20% of disasters in 2019 occurred in North America, including the Caribbean and Central America, for total damages of US$55 billion, of which US$29 billion were insured (130). Loss events included Hurricane Dorian, which caused billions of dollars in damage, especially in the Bahamas, in late August to early September. Heavy losses that year also resulted from severe weather, floods, and a winter storm in the United States. A mixture of snowmelt triggered by unusually high temperatures in March and storms with torrential rain led to sustained and extensive flooding in Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, and Mississippi (49).\nOverall, the numbers and costs of disasters have been increasing for several decades due to increases in exposure (more people moving into harm\u2019s way and increases in the values of property and infrastructure at risk), vulnerability of people and infrastructure, and climate change (170). Since 1980, the United States has experienced 265 weather and climate disasters in which the overall damages reached or exceeded US$1 billion; the total costs were greater than US$1.775 trillion (132), with an estimated 14,223 deaths (an average of 356 per year), although the numbers of deaths are likely an underestimate (178).\nBeyond the damage to infrastructure, extreme weather events and disasters can affect the health and well-being of individuals and can have catastrophic impacts on communities and health systems. People can suffer from a wide range of physical effects (e.g., heat exhaustion, injuries in severe storms, and respiratory illnesses from molds due to floods) as well as longer-term impacts on mental health. Health systems and facilities can be affected by impacts on patients and health care staff, medical and nonmedical supplies, facility operations, and critical infrastructures. To prepare for climate change, health-sector and emergency-management officials\u2014as well as urban planners, neighborhood services staff, and others\u2014require information about how hazards are projected to change, possible future exposures of people and property, likely changes in population health and health care infrastructure vulnerabilities, and needed capacities to prepare for and manage the events and their aftermath.\nWe review (a) the current impacts and projected risks of climate change on the health of populations and health systems from extreme weather and climate events and from wildfires, (b) the value of disaster management to reduce health risks from these changes, and (c) adaptation and mitigation measures that can explicitly address climate change in policies and planning processes.\nGlobal land surface air temperature has risen 1.53\u00b0C since the preindustrial period of 1850\u20131900, with considerable variation in regional warming; this increase is much larger than the observed warming combined over land and oceans (0.87\u00b0C) (84). Climate models project robust differences in regional climate characteristics, including extremes.\nDetection and attribution analytic methods are increasingly being applied to determine the effects of climate change on the frequency a\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Blue bars indicate cooler-than-average years; red bars show warmer-than-average years. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Information.\nAccording to the annual report from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, 2024 was the warmest year since global records began in 1850. The global average surface temperature was 2.32 Fahrenheit (1.29 degrees Celsius) above the 20th-century average (57.0 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.9 degrees Celsius) and 2.63 degrees Fahrenheit (1.46 degrees Celsius) above the pre-industrial average (56.7 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.7 degrees Celsius), which NOAA defines as the period from 1850-1900.\nGlobal temperatures in 2024 were above the 1991-2020 average (red) across most of the planet. Yearly temperatures compared to the 20th-century average (bar chart) show that it has been 48 years since Earth had a cooler-than-average year. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe 2024 global temperature anomaly (anomaly means \u201cdifference from average\u201d) is 0.18 degrees F (0.10 degrees C) warmer than the previous record, set the year before, in 2023. The ten warmest years in the 175-year record have all occurred during the last decade (2015\u20132024). When the new century started in 2000, the first year to set a new high-temperature record was 2005. Now, 2005 is just the 13th-warmest year on record.\nOther 2024 rankings included...\nFor more regional details and 2024 climate statistics, see the 2024 Global Climate Report from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe global average surface temperature is an indicator of the state of Earth\u2019s energy balance: how much sunlight it absorbs minus how much heat it radiates back to space. When these amounts are the same, Earth\u2019s average surface temperature remains steady. When they are out of balance, Earth cools or warms. Earth\u2019s average surface temperature has been rising because human-produced greenhouse gases are causing Earth to absorb more energy than it radiates back to space.\nGiven the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of added heat energy to raise Earth\u2019s average surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree-Fahrenheit (1-degree-Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1850-1900 in NOAA's record) might seem small, but it represents a significant increase in heat energy circulating through all parts of the Earth system, including the oceans, frozen landscapes, and the atmosphere.\nBeyond being an indicator of changes in Earth\u2019s energy balance, surface temperature matters because it controls many environmental and ecological processes that are important to humans and other life, including the water cycle (evaporation, clouds, surface water supplies, and precipitation), the carbon cycle, and the kinds of plants, animals, and other living things that can survive in different places on Earth.\nThe concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (55 degrees Celsius) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the \"average\" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget, which can only be directly measured from space.\nTo calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute temperature readings to temperature anomalies\u2014the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend.\nAcross inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and known physical relationships\u2014such as the way temperature decreases with altitude\u2014to estimate the missing values. Each value is then used to calculate a global-scale temperature anomaly. This process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in Earth's surface temperature over time. Read more about how the global surface temperature record is built in our Climate Data Primer.\nTemperature change has not been uniform across the planet, but more areas are warming than cooling. And the rate of warming has accelerated in recent decades. According to NOAA's 2024 Annual Climate Report the combined land and ocean temperature has warmed at an average rate of 0.11 degrees Fahrenheit (0.06 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1850 and more than three times that rate (0.36 degrees Fahrenheit, or 0.20 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1975.\nRecent rates of global warming (1994-2024, bottom) are larger than the longer-term average rates (1901-2024, top). Places that have cooled are colored blue; places that have warmed are colored yellow, orange, or red. In the past three decades, many places in the Northern Hemisphere have warmed by 1 degree Fahrenheit or more per decade. Differences are most dramatic in the Arctic.

Burning ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nClimate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. Such shifts can be natural, due to changes in the sun\u2019s activity or large volcanic eruptions. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.\nBurning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun\u2019s heat and raising temperatures.\nThe main greenhouse gases that are causing climate change include carbon dioxide and methane. These come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example. Clearing land and cutting down forests can also release carbon dioxide. Agriculture, oil and gas operations are major sources of methane emissions. Energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main sectors causing greenhouse gases.\nClimate scientists have showed that humans are responsible for virtually all global heating over the last 200 years. Human activities like the ones mentioned above are causing greenhouse gases that are warming the world faster than at any time in at least the last two thousand years.\nThe average temperature of the Earth\u2019s surface is now about 1.42\u00b0C warmer than it was in the late 1800s-prior to the industrial revolution-and warmer than at any time in the last 100,000 years. The last decade (2015-2024) was the warmest on record, and each of the last four decades has been warmer than any previous decade since 1850.\nMany people think that climate change mainly means warmer temperatures. But temperature rise is only the beginning of the story. Because the Earth is a system where everything is connected, changes in one area can influence changes in all others.\nThe consequences of climate change include, among others, intense droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice, catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.\nClimate change can affect our health, ability to grow food, housing, safety and work. Some of us are already more vulnerable to climate impacts, such as people living in small island nations and other developing countries. Conditions like sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion have advanced to the point where entire communities have had to relocate, while protracted droughts are putting people at risk of famine. In the future, the number of people displaced by weather-related events is expected to rise.\nIn a series of UN reports, thousands of scientists and government reviewers agreed that limiting global temperature rise to no more than 1.5\u00b0C would help us avoid the worst climate impacts and maintain a liveable climate. Yet policies currently in place point to up to 2.8\u00b0C of warming by the end of the century.\nThe emissions that cause climate change come from every part of the world and affect everyone, but some countries produce much more than others. The six biggest emitters (China, the United States of America, India, the European Union, the Russian Federation, and Indonesia) together account for more than half of all global greenhouse gas emissions. By contrast, the 45 least developed countries contribute only 3 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.\nEveryone must take climate action, but people and countries creating more of the problem have a greater responsibility to act first.\nMany climate change solutions can deliver economic benefits while improving our lives and protecting the environment. We also have global frameworks and agreements to guide progress, such as the Sustainable Development Goals, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. Three broad categories of action are: cutting emissions, adapting to climate impacts and financing required adjustments.\nSwitching energy systems from fossil fuels to renewables like solar or wind will reduce the emissions driving climate change. But we have to act now. While a growing number of countries is committing to net zero emissions by 2050, emissions must be cut in half by 2030 to keep warming below 1.5\u00b0C. Achieving this means huge declines in the use of coal, oil and gas: production and consumption of all fossil fuels need to be cut by at least 30 per cent by 2030 in order to prevent catastrophic levels of climate change.\nAdapting to climate consequences protects people, homes, businesses, livelihoods, infrastructure and natural ecosystems. It covers current impacts and those likely in the future. Adaptation will be required everywhere but must be prioritized now for the most vulnerable people with the fewest resources to cope with climate hazards. The rate of return can be high. Early warning systems for disasters, for instance, save lives and property, and can deliver benefits up to 10 times the initial cost.\nClimate action requires significant financial investments by governments and businesses. But climate inaction is vastly more expensive. One critical step is for developed countries to support developing countries so they can adapt and move towards greener economies.\nTo get familiar with some of the more technical terms used in connection with climate change, consult the Climate Dictionary.\nClimate change is a hot topic \u2013 with myths and falsehoods circulating widely.

These events and events influenced by climate change, such as wildfires, continue to cause significant human morbidity and mortality and adversely affect mental health and well-being. Although adverse health impacts from extreme events declined over the past few decades, climate change and more people moving into harm\u2019s way could alter this trend. Long-term changes to Earth\u2019s energy balance are increasing the frequency and intensity of many extreme events and the probability of compound events, with trends projected to accelerate under certain greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. While most of these events cannot be completely avoided, many of the health risks could be prevented through building climate-resilient health systems with improved risk reduction, preparation, response, and recovery. Conducting vulnerability and adaptation assessments and developing health system adaptation plans can identify priority actions to effectively reduce risks, such as disaster risk management and more resilient infrastructure. The risks are urgent, so action is needed now.\nKeywords: climate change, climate variability, extreme events, population health, health systems\nWorldwide, in 2019, there were 396 disasters1 that killed 11,755 people, affected 95 million others, and cost nearly US$130 billion (28). Asia was the most affected continent with 40% of the events, 45% of the deaths, and 74% of all people affected. Floods and storms accounted for 68% of the number of affected people worldwide. Anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, land use change, and other activities impacting the global energy balance are altering the frequency and intensity of many extreme weather and climate events, with some regions experiencing increases in heat waves, floods, and droughts (84). Events influenced by climate change, particularly wildfires, also are increasing.\nRisks from extreme weather and climate events arise from the intersection of the physical hazard (e.g., wind and rain), the extent of exposure to the hazard, the vulnerability of individuals and communities, and the capacity to prepare for, manage, and recover from extreme events.\nA disaster generally is defined as a sudden, calamitous event that disrupts the functioning of a community or society and that exceeds its ability to cope using its own resources (81). The occurrence of an extreme event is not required for a community or region to experience extreme impacts, such as large increase in mortality; an extreme impact can arise from a moderately strong event when it occurs in a highly vulnerable population. The converse also is true, that an extreme event may not result in extreme impacts when communities are prepared.\nRoughly 20% of disasters in 2019 occurred in North America, including the Caribbean and Central America, for total damages of US$55 billion, of which US$29 billion were insured (130). Loss events included Hurricane Dorian, which caused billions of dollars in damage, especially in the Bahamas, in late August to early September. Heavy losses that year also resulted from severe weather, floods, and a winter storm in the United States. A mixture of snowmelt triggered by unusually high temperatures in March and storms with torrential rain led to sustained and extensive flooding in Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, and Mississippi (49).\nOverall, the numbers and costs of disasters have been increasing for several decades due to increases in exposure (more people moving into harm\u2019s way and increases in the values of property and infrastructure at risk), vulnerability of people and infrastructure, and climate change (170). Since 1980, the United States has experienced 265 weather and climate disasters in which the overall damages reached or exceeded US$1 billion; the total costs were greater than US$1.775 trillion (132), with an estimated 14,223 deaths (an average of 356 per year), although the numbers of deaths are likely an underestimate (178).\nBeyond the damage to infrastructure, extreme weather events and disasters can affect the health and well-being of individuals and can have catastrophic impacts on communities and health systems. People can suffer from a wide range of physical effects (e.g., heat exhaustion, injuries in severe storms, and respiratory illnesses from molds due to floods) as well as longer-term impacts on mental health. Health systems and facilities can be affected by impacts on patients and health care staff, medical and nonmedical supplies, facility operations, and critical infrastructures. To prepare for climate change, health-sector and emergency-management officials\u2014as well as urban planners, neighborhood services staff, and others\u2014require information about how hazards are projected to change, possible future exposures of people and property, likely changes in population health and health care infrastructure vulnerabilities, and needed capacities to prepare for and manage the events and their aftermath.\nWe review (a) the current impacts and projected risks of climate change on the health of populations and health systems from extreme weather and climate events and from wildfires, (b) the value of disaster management to reduce health risks from these changes, and (c) adaptation and mitigation measures that can explicitly address climate change in policies and planning processes.\nGlobal land surface air temperature has risen 1.53\u00b0C since the preindustrial period of 1850\u20131900, with considerable variation in regional warming; this increase is much larger than the observed warming combined over land and oceans (0.87\u00b0C) (84).

Anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, land use change, and other activities impacting the global energy balance are altering the frequency and intensity of many extreme weather and climate events, with some regions experiencing increases in heat waves, floods, and droughts (84). Events influenced by climate change, particularly wildfires, also are increasing.\nRisks from extreme weather and climate events arise from the intersection of the physical hazard (e.g., wind and rain), the extent of exposure to the hazard, the vulnerability of individuals and communities, and the capacity to prepare for, manage, and recover from extreme events.\nA disaster generally is defined as a sudden, calamitous event that disrupts the functioning of a community or society and that exceeds its ability to cope using its own resources (81). The occurrence of an extreme event is not required for a community or region to experience extreme impacts, such as large increase in mortality; an extreme impact can arise from a moderately strong event when it occurs in a highly vulnerable population. The converse also is true, that an extreme event may not result in extreme impacts when communities are prepared.\nRoughly 20% of disasters in 2019 occurred in North America, including the Caribbean and Central America, for total damages of US$55 billion, of which US$29 billion were insured (130). Loss events included Hurricane Dorian, which caused billions of dollars in damage, especially in the Bahamas, in late August to early September. Heavy losses that year also resulted from severe weather, floods, and a winter storm in the United States. A mixture of snowmelt triggered by unusually high temperatures in March and storms with torrential rain led to sustained and extensive flooding in Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, and Mississippi (49).\nOverall, the numbers and costs of disasters have been increasing for several decades due to increases in exposure (more people moving into harm\u2019s way and increases in the values of property and infrastructure at risk), vulnerability of people and infrastructure, and climate change (170). Since 1980, the United States has experienced 265 weather and climate disasters in which the overall damages reached or exceeded US$1 billion; the total costs were greater than US$1.775 trillion (132), with an estimated 14,223 deaths (an average of 356 per year), although the numbers of deaths are likely an underestimate (178).\nBeyond the damage to infrastructure, extreme weather events and disasters can affect the health and well-being of individuals and can have catastrophic impacts on communities and health systems. People can suffer from a wide range of physical effects (e.g., heat exhaustion, injuries in severe storms, and respiratory illnesses from molds due to floods) as well as longer-term impacts on mental health. Health systems and facilities can be affected by impacts on patients and health care staff, medical and nonmedical supplies, facility operations, and critical infrastructures. To prepare for climate change, health-sector and emergency-management officials\u2014as well as urban planners, neighborhood services staff, and others\u2014require information about how hazards are projected to change, possible future exposures of people and property, likely changes in population health and health care infrastructure vulnerabilities, and needed capacities to prepare for and manage the events and their aftermath.\nWe review (a) the current impacts and projected risks of climate change on the health of populations and health systems from extreme weather and climate events and from wildfires, (b) the value of disaster management to reduce health risks from these changes, and (c) adaptation and mitigation measures that can explicitly address climate change in policies and planning processes.\nGlobal land surface air temperature has risen 1.53\u00b0C since the preindustrial period of 1850\u20131900, with considerable variation in regional warming; this increase is much larger than the observed warming combined over land and oceans (0.87\u00b0C) (84). Climate models project robust differences in regional climate characteristics, including extremes.\nDetection and attribution analytic methods are increasingly being applied to determine the effects of climate change on the frequency a\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

HWF have ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nThe frequency of heat waves has increased dramatically over the past 40 years, and the trend appears to be growing faster in urban areas than in less-populated areas around the world, a new study suggests.\n\u201cOur findings suggest that urban areas are experiencing a kind of double whammy \u2014 a combination of general climatic warming combined with the heat island effect, wherein human activities and the built environment trap heat, preventing cities from cooling down as fast as rural areas,\u201d said Dennis Lettenmaier, a co-author of the study and a UCLA geography professor. \u201cEverything\u2019s warming up, but the effect is amplified in urban areas.\u201d\nLettenmaier and his co-authors studied 217 urban areas across the globe and found that prolonged periods of extreme heat increased significantly in 48 percent of them between 1973 and 2012.\nThe results, which were published today in the journal Environmental Research Letters, show that about only 2 percent of those urban areas experienced a significant decline in heat waves. And the change was more dramatic at night: Almost two-thirds of the urban areas showed significant increases in the frequency of extremely hot nights.\n\u201cThe fact that the trend was so much stronger at night underscores the role of the heat island effect in urban areas,\u201d Lettenmaier said. \u201cYou have heat being stored in buildings and in asphalt, concrete and other building materials, and they don\u2019t cool down as quickly as they would outside of the urban area. This effect was likely exacerbated by decreasing wind in most of the urban areas.\u201d\nThe study is one of the first to focus solely on the extent of extreme weather in urban areas globally and to examine disparities between densely populated and less-densely populated areas.\nLettenmaier collaborated with researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar, Northeastern University and the University of Washington. The team obtained daily observations for rain, air temperature and wind speed from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The researchers identified about 650 urban areas with populations greater than 250,000 and then refined the list to the 217 locales based on the areas\u2019 proximity to weather stations with complete weather records and NOAA data \u2014 most were located at airports close to urban areas. Although the researchers would have liked to have more data for urban areas in Africa, Lettenmaier said the report provides as close as possible to a representative sample of changing weather conditions in the world\u2019s cities.\nFor each of the locales in the study, the researchers identified extremes for temperature, precipitation and wind, calculated heat and cold waves, and pinpointed individual extremely hot days and nights.\nThe study defined heat waves as periods in which the daily maximum temperature was hotter than 99 percent of days for the four-decade period and in which those temperatures were sustained for a consecutive period of six or more days. (The median length of heat waves was eight days.) It found that the average number of heat waves per year increased by over 50 percent during the period.\nOf the five years with the largest number of heat waves, four were the most recent years for which data was available: 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012. Urban areas in South America experienced the greatest increase in frequency of heat waves, followed in order by those in Africa, Europe, India and North America.\nResearchers also found other striking examples of climate change within urban settings. Sixty percent experienced a significant decline in extreme windy days, 17 percent experienced a significant increase in daily precipitation extremes, and 10 percent experienced a significant increase in maximum annual precipitation.\n\u201cUrban areas make up a relatively small part of the global land area, but over half the world\u2019s populations now live in them, so the trend is troublesome,\u201d said lead author Vimal Mishra, an assistant professor of civil engineering at IIT Gandhinagar. \u201cThe combination of higher temperatures and lower wind in particular is not a good combination for human health and well-being. This should concern everyone.\u201d\nThe increase in precipitation could damage cities\u2019 infrastructure, which could also mean large economic losses, Mishra said.\nUsing a separate data set of 142 pairs of urban and non-urban areas, the researchers found that the frequency of heat waves grew 56 percent more quickly in urban settings than in surrounding areas that were less populated. Urban areas experienced 60 percent fewer extremely windy days than non-urban areas.\n\u201cIn urban areas, buildings are disrupting the air flow, which affects not only the immediate area of buildings, but apparently the larger regional wind fields,\u201d Lettenmaier said. \u201cThe reduction in wind may well be exacerbating the heat island effect.\u201d\nJessica Wolf 310-825-1046 jwolf@stratcomm.ucla.edu\nGet top research & news headlines four days a week.\n(Check your inbox or spam filter for confirmation.)\nSubscribe to a UCLA Newsroom RSS feed and our story headlines will be automatically delivered to your news reader.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

    "input_prompt": "Claim:\nHuman-induced global warming is a major underlying factor for changing weather patterns.\n\nArticle Title:\nCauses of Climate Change | US EPA\n\nGoogle Search Snippet:\nIn addition, human activities emit more than 100 times as much carbon dioxide as volcanoes each year.\n\nFull Page Content:\nClimate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. Such shifts can be natural, due to changes in the sun\u2019s activity or large volcanic eruptions. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.\nBurning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun\u2019s heat and raising temperatures.\nThe main greenhouse gases that are causing climate change include carbon dioxide and methane. These come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example. Clearing land and cutting down forests can also release carbon dioxide. Agriculture, oil and gas operations are major sources of methane emissions. Energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main sectors causing greenhouse gases.\nClimate scientists have showed that humans are responsible for virtually all global heating over the last 200 years. Human activities like the ones mentioned above are causing greenhouse gases that are warming the world faster than at any time in at least the last two thousand years.\nThe average temperature of the Earth\u2019s surface is now about 1.42\u00b0C warmer than it was in the late 1800s-prior to the industrial revolution-and warmer than at any time in the last 100,000 years. The last decade (2015-2024) was the warmest on record, and each of the last four decades has been warmer than any previous decade since 1850.\nMany people think that climate change mainly means warmer temperatures. But temperature rise is only the beginning of the story. Because the Earth is a system where everything is connected, changes in one area can influence changes in all others.\nThe consequences of climate change include, among others, intense droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice, catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.\nClimate change can affect our health, ability to grow food, housing, safety and work. Some of us are already more vulnerable to climate impacts, such as people living in small island nations and other developing countries. Conditions like sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion have advanced to the point where entire communities have had to relocate, while protracted droughts are putting people at risk of famine. In the future, the number of people displaced by weather-related events is expected to rise.\nIn a series of UN reports, thousands of scientists and government reviewers agreed that limiting global temperature rise to no more than 1.5\u00b0C would help us avoid the worst climate impacts and maintain a liveable climate. Yet policies currently in place point to up to 2.8\u00b0C of warming by the end of the century.\nThe emissions that cause climate change come from every part of the world and affect everyone, but some countries produce much more than others. The six biggest emitters (China, the United States of America, India, the European Union, the Russian Federation, and Indonesia) together account for more than half of all global greenhouse gas emissions. By contrast, the 45 least developed countries contribute only 3 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.\nEveryone must take climate action, but people and countries creating more of the problem have a greater responsibility to act first.\nMany climate change solutions can deliver economic benefits while improving our lives and protecting the environment. We also have global frameworks and agreements to guide progress, such as the Sustainable Development Goals, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. Three broad categories of action are: cutting emissions, adapting to climate impacts and financing required adjustments.\nSwitching energy systems from fossil fuels to renewables like solar or wind will reduce the emissions driving climate change. But we have to act now. While a growing number of countries is committing to net zero emissions by 2050, emissions must be cut in half by 2030 to keep warming below 1.5\u00b0C. Achieving this means huge declines in the use of coal, oil and gas: production and consumption of all fossil fuels need to be cut by at least 30 per cent by 2030 in order to prevent catastrophic levels of climate change.\nAdapting to climate consequences protects people, homes, businesses, livelihoods, infrastructure and natural ecosystems. It covers current impacts and those likely in the future. Adaptation will be required everywhere but must be prioritized now for the most vulnerable people with the fewest resources to cope with climate hazards. The rate of return can be high. Early warning systems for disasters, for instance, save lives and property, and can deliver benefits up to 10 times the initial cost.\nClimate action requires significant financial investments by governments and businesses. But climate inaction is vastly more expensive. One critical step is for developed countries to support developing countries so they can adapt and move towards greener economies.\nTo get familiar with some of the more technical terms used in connection with climate change, consult the Climate Dictionary.\nClimate change is a hot topic \u2013 with myths and falsehoods circulating widely.

Blue bars indicate cooler-than-average years; red bars show warmer-than-average years. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Information.\nAccording to the annual report from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, 2024 was the warmest year since global records began in 1850. The global average surface temperature was 2.32 Fahrenheit (1.29 degrees Celsius) above the 20th-century average (57.0 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.9 degrees Celsius) and 2.63 degrees Fahrenheit (1.46 degrees Celsius) above the pre-industrial average (56.7 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.7 degrees Celsius), which NOAA defines as the period from 1850-1900.\nGlobal temperatures in 2024 were above the 1991-2020 average (red) across most of the planet. Yearly temperatures compared to the 20th-century average (bar chart) show that it has been 48 years since Earth had a cooler-than-average year. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe 2024 global temperature anomaly (anomaly means \u201cdifference from average\u201d) is 0.18 degrees F (0.10 degrees C) warmer than the previous record, set the year before, in 2023. The ten warmest years in the 175-year record have all occurred during the last decade (2015\u20132024). When the new century started in 2000, the first year to set a new high-temperature record was 2005. Now, 2005 is just the 13th-warmest year on record.\nOther 2024 rankings included...\nFor more regional details and 2024 climate statistics, see the 2024 Global Climate Report from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe global average surface temperature is an indicator of the state of Earth\u2019s energy balance: how much sunlight it absorbs minus how much heat it radiates back to space. When these amounts are the same, Earth\u2019s average surface temperature remains steady. When they are out of balance, Earth cools or warms. Earth\u2019s average surface temperature has been rising because human-produced greenhouse gases are causing Earth to absorb more energy than it radiates back to space.\nGiven the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of added heat energy to raise Earth\u2019s average surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree-Fahrenheit (1-degree-Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1850-1900 in NOAA's record) might seem small, but it represents a significant increase in heat energy circulating through all parts of the Earth system, including the oceans, frozen landscapes, and the atmosphere.\nBeyond being an indicator of changes in Earth\u2019s energy balance, surface temperature matters because it controls many environmental and ecological processes that are important to humans and other life, including the water cycle (evaporation, clouds, surface water supplies, and precipitation), the carbon cycle, and the kinds of plants, animals, and other living things that can survive in different places on Earth.\nThe concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (55 degrees Celsius) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the \"average\" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget, which can only be directly measured from space.\nTo calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute temperature readings to temperature anomalies\u2014the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend.\nAcross inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and known physical relationships\u2014such as the way temperature decreases with altitude\u2014to estimate the missing values. Each value is then used to calculate a global-scale temperature anomaly. This process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in Earth's surface temperature over time. Read more about how the global surface temperature record is built in our Climate Data Primer.\nTemperature change has not been uniform across the planet, but more areas are warming than cooling. And the rate of warming has accelerated in recent decades. According to NOAA's 2024 Annual Climate Report the combined land and ocean temperature has warmed at an average rate of 0.11 degrees Fahrenheit (0.06 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1850 and more than three times that rate (0.36 degrees Fahrenheit, or 0.20 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1975.\nRecent rates of global warming (1994-2024, bottom) are larger than the longer-term average rates (1901-2024, top). Places that have cooled are colored blue; places that have warmed are colored yellow, orange, or red. In the past three decades, many places in the Northern Hemisphere have warmed by 1 degree Fahrenheit or more per decade. Differences are most dramatic in the Arctic. With the decline of ice and snow, the Arctic reflects less incoming sunlight, which amplifies the rate of greenhouse-gas-driven warming. NOAA Climate.gov, based o\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Such shifts can be natural, due to changes in the sun\u2019s activity or large volcanic eruptions. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.\nBurning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun\u2019s heat and raising temperatures.\nThe main greenhouse gases that are causing climate change include carbon dioxide and methane. These come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example. Clearing land and cutting down forests can also release carbon dioxide. Agriculture, oil and gas operations are major sources of methane emissions. Energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main sectors causing greenhouse gases.\nClimate scientists have showed that humans are responsible for virtually all global heating over the last 200 years. Human activities like the ones mentioned above are causing greenhouse gases that are warming the world faster than at any time in at least the last two thousand years.\nThe average temperature of the Earth\u2019s surface is now about 1.42\u00b0C warmer than it was in the late 1800s-prior to the industrial revolution-and warmer than at any time in the last 100,000 years. The last decade (2015-2024) was the warmest on record, and each of the last four decades has been warmer than any previous decade since 1850.\nMany people think that climate change mainly means warmer temperatures. But temperature rise is only the beginning of the story. Because the Earth is a system where everything is connected, changes in one area can influence changes in all others.\nThe consequences of climate change include, among others, intense droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice, catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.\nClimate change can affect our health, ability to grow food, housing, safety and work. Some of us are already more vulnerable to climate impacts, such as people living in small island nations and other developing countries. Conditions like sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion have advanced to the point where entire communities have had to relocate, while protracted droughts are putting people at risk of famine. In the future, the number of people displaced by weather-related events is expected to rise.\nIn a series of UN reports, thousands of scientists and government reviewers agreed that limiting global temperature rise to no more than 1.5\u00b0C would help us avoid the worst climate impacts and maintain a liveable climate. Yet policies currently in place point to up to 2.8\u00b0C of warming by the end of the century.\nThe emissions that cause climate change come from every part of the world and affect everyone, but some countries produce much more than others. The six biggest emitters (China, the United States of America, India, the European Union, the Russian Federation, and Indonesia) together account for more than half of all global greenhouse gas emissions. By contrast, the 45 least developed countries contribute only 3 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.\nEveryone must take climate action, but people and countries creating more of the problem have a greater responsibility to act first.\nMany climate change solutions can deliver economic benefits while improving our lives and protecting the environment. We also have global frameworks and agreements to guide progress, such as the Sustainable Development Goals, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. Three broad categories of action are: cutting emissions, adapting to climate impacts and financing required adjustments.\nSwitching energy systems from fossil fuels to renewables like solar or wind will reduce the emissions driving climate change. But we have to act now. While a growing number of countries is committing to net zero emissions by 2050, emissions must be cut in half by 2030 to keep warming below 1.5\u00b0C. Achieving this means huge declines in the use of coal, oil and gas: production and consumption of all fossil fuels need to be cut by at least 30 per cent by 2030 in order to prevent catastrophic levels of climate change.\nAdapting to climate consequences protects people, homes, businesses, livelihoods, infrastructure and natural ecosystems. It covers current impacts and those likely in the future. Adaptation will be required everywhere but must be prioritized now for the most vulnerable people with the fewest resources to cope with climate hazards. The rate of return can be high. Early warning systems for disasters, for instance, save lives and property, and can deliver benefits up to 10 times the initial cost.\nClimate action requires significant financial investments by governments and businesses.

And the change was more dramatic at night: Almost two-thirds of the urban areas showed significant increases in the frequency of extremely hot nights.\n\u201cThe fact that the trend was so much stronger at night underscores the role of the heat island effect in urban areas,\u201d Lettenmaier said. \u201cYou have heat being stored in buildings and in asphalt, concrete and other building materials, and they don\u2019t cool down as quickly as they would outside of the urban area. This effect was likely exacerbated by decreasing wind in most of the urban areas.\u201d\nThe study is one of the first to focus solely on the extent of extreme weather in urban areas globally and to examine disparities between densely populated and less-densely populated areas.\nLettenmaier collaborated with researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar, Northeastern University and the University of Washington. The team obtained daily observations for rain, air temperature and wind speed from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The researchers identified about 650 urban areas with populations greater than 250,000 and then refined the list to the 217 locales based on the areas\u2019 proximity to weather stations with complete weather records and NOAA data \u2014 most were located at airports close to urban areas. Although the researchers would have liked to have more data for urban areas in Africa, Lettenmaier said the report provides as close as possible to a representative sample of changing weather conditions in the world\u2019s cities.\nFor each of the locales in the study, the researchers identified extremes for temperature, precipitation and wind, calculated heat and cold waves, and pinpointed individual extremely hot days and nights.\nThe study defined heat waves as periods in which the daily maximum temperature was hotter than 99 percent of days for the four-decade period and in which those temperatures were sustained for a consecutive period of six or more days. (The median length of heat waves was eight days.) It found that the average number of heat waves per year increased by over 50 percent during the period.\nOf the five years with the largest number of heat waves, four were the most recent years for which data was available: 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012. Urban areas in South America experienced the greatest increase in frequency of heat waves, followed in order by those in Africa, Europe, India and North America.\nResearchers also found other striking examples of climate change within urban settings. Sixty percent experienced a significant decline in extreme windy days, 17 percent experienced a significant increase in daily precipitation extremes, and 10 percent experienced a significant increase in maximum annual precipitation.\n\u201cUrban areas make up a relatively small part of the global land area, but over half the world\u2019s populations now live in them, so the trend is troublesome,\u201d said lead author Vimal Mishra, an assistant professor of civil engineering at IIT Gandhinagar. \u201cThe combination of higher temperatures and lower wind in particular is not a good combination for human health and well-being. This should concern everyone.\u201d\nThe increase in precipitation could damage cities\u2019 infrastructure, which could also mean large economic losses, Mishra said.\nUsing a separate data set of 142 pairs of urban and non-urban areas, the researchers found that the frequency of heat waves grew 56 percent more quickly in urban settings than in surrounding areas that were less populated. Urban areas experienced 60 percent fewer extremely windy days than non-urban areas.\n\u201cIn urban areas, buildings are disrupting the air flow, which affects not only the immediate area of buildings, but apparently the larger regional wind fields,\u201d Lettenmaier said. \u201cThe reduction in wind may well be exacerbating the heat island effect.\u201d\nJessica Wolf 310-825-1046 jwolf@stratcomm.ucla.edu\nGet top research & news headlines four days a week.\n(Check your inbox or spam filter for confirmation.)\nSubscribe to a UCLA Newsroom RSS feed and our story headlines will be automatically delivered to your news reader.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

And the change was more dramatic at night: Almost two-thirds of the urban areas showed significant increases in the frequency of extremely hot nights.\n\u201cThe fact that the trend was so much stronger at night underscores the role of the heat island effect in urban areas,\u201d Lettenmaier said. \u201cYou have heat being stored in buildings and in asphalt, concrete and other building materials, and they don\u2019t cool down as quickly as they would outside of the urban area. This effect was likely exacerbated by decreasing wind in most of the urban areas.\u201d\nThe study is one of the first to focus solely on the extent of extreme weather in urban areas globally and to examine disparities between densely populated and less-densely populated areas.\nLettenmaier collaborated with researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar, Northeastern University and the University of Washington. The team obtained daily observations for rain, air temperature and wind speed from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The researchers identified about 650 urban areas with populations greater than 250,000 and then refined the list to the 217 locales based on the areas\u2019 proximity to weather stations with complete weather records and NOAA data \u2014 most were located at airports close to urban areas. Although the researchers would have liked to have more data for urban areas in Africa, Lettenmaier said the report provides as close as possible to a representative sample of changing weather conditions in the world\u2019s cities.\nFor each of the locales in the study, the researchers identified extremes for temperature, precipitation and wind, calculated heat and cold waves, and pinpointed individual extremely hot days and nights.\nThe study defined heat waves as periods in which the daily maximum temperature was hotter than 99 percent of days for the four-decade period and in which those temperatures were sustained for a consecutive period of six or more days. (The median length of heat waves was eight days.) It found that the average number of heat waves per year increased by over 50 percent during the period.\nOf the five years with the largest number of heat waves, four were the most recent years for which data was available: 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012. Urban areas in South America experienced the greatest increase in frequency of heat waves, followed in order by those in Africa, Europe, India and North America.\nResearchers also found other striking examples of climate change within urban settings. Sixty percent experienced a significant decline in extreme windy days, 17 percent experienced a significant increase in daily precipitation extremes, and 10 percent experienced a significant increase in maximum annual precipitation.\n\u201cUrban areas make up a relatively small part of the global land area, but over half the world\u2019s populations now live in them, so the trend is troublesome,\u201d said lead author Vimal Mishra, an assistant professor of civil engineering at IIT Gandhinagar. \u201cThe combination of higher temperatures and lower wind in particular is not a good combination for human health and well-being. This should concern everyone.\u201d\nThe increase in precipitation could damage cities\u2019 infrastructure, which could also mean large economic losses, Mishra said.\nUsing a separate data set of 142 pairs of urban and non-urban areas, the researchers found that the frequency of heat waves grew 56 percent more quickly in urban settings than in surrounding areas that were less populated. Urban areas experienced 60 percent fewer extremely windy days than non-urban areas.\n\u201cIn urban areas, buildings are disrupting the air flow, which affects not only the immediate area of buildings, but apparently the larger regional wind fields,\u201d Lettenmaier said. \u201cThe reduction in wind may well be exacerbating the heat island effect.\u201d\nJessica Wolf 310-825-1046 jwolf@stratcomm.ucla.edu\nGet top research & news headlines four days a week.\n(Check your inbox or spam filter for confirmation.)\nSubscribe to a UCLA Newsroom RSS feed and our story headlines will be automatically delivered to your news reader.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Conducting vulnerability and adaptation assessments and developing health system adaptation plans can identify priority actions to effectively reduce risks, such as disaster risk management and more resilient infrastructure. The risks are urgent, so action is needed now.\nKeywords: climate change, climate variability, extreme events, population health, health systems\nWorldwide, in 2019, there were 396 disasters1 that killed 11,755 people, affected 95 million others, and cost nearly US$130 billion (28). Asia was the most affected continent with 40% of the events, 45% of the deaths, and 74% of all people affected. Floods and storms accounted for 68% of the number of affected people worldwide. Anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, land use change, and other activities impacting the global energy balance are altering the frequency and intensity of many extreme weather and climate events, with some regions experiencing increases in heat waves, floods, and droughts (84). Events influenced by climate change, particularly wildfires, also are increasing.\nRisks from extreme weather and climate events arise from the intersection of the physical hazard (e.g., wind and rain), the extent of exposure to the hazard, the vulnerability of individuals and communities, and the capacity to prepare for, manage, and recover from extreme events.\nA disaster generally is defined as a sudden, calamitous event that disrupts the functioning of a community or society and that exceeds its ability to cope using its own resources (81). The occurrence of an extreme event is not required for a community or region to experience extreme impacts, such as large increase in mortality; an extreme impact can arise from a moderately strong event when it occurs in a highly vulnerable population. The converse also is true, that an extreme event may not result in extreme impacts when communities are prepared.\nRoughly 20% of disasters in 2019 occurred in North America, including the Caribbean and Central America, for total damages of US$55 billion, of which US$29 billion were insured (130). Loss events included Hurricane Dorian, which caused billions of dollars in damage, especially in the Bahamas, in late August to early September. Heavy losses that year also resulted from severe weather, floods, and a winter storm in the United States. A mixture of snowmelt triggered by unusually high temperatures in March and storms with torrential rain led to sustained and extensive flooding in Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, and Mississippi (49).\nOverall, the numbers and costs of disasters have been increasing for several decades due to increases in exposure (more people moving into harm\u2019s way and increases in the values of property and infrastructure at risk), vulnerability of people and infrastructure, and climate change (170). Since 1980, the United States has experienced 265 weather and climate disasters in which the overall damages reached or exceeded US$1 billion; the total costs were greater than US$1.775 trillion (132), with an estimated 14,223 deaths (an average of 356 per year), although the numbers of deaths are likely an underestimate (178).\nBeyond the damage to infrastructure, extreme weather events and disasters can affect the health and well-being of individuals and can have catastrophic impacts on communities and health systems. People can suffer from a wide range of physical effects (e.g., heat exhaustion, injuries in severe storms, and respiratory illnesses from molds due to floods) as well as longer-term impacts on mental health. Health systems and facilities can be affected by impacts on patients and health care staff, medical and nonmedical supplies, facility operations, and critical infrastructures. To prepare for climate change, health-sector and emergency-management officials\u2014as well as urban planners, neighborhood services staff, and others\u2014require information about how hazards are projected to change, possible future exposures of people and property, likely changes in population health and health care infrastructure vulnerabilities, and needed capacities to prepare for and manage the events and their aftermath.\nWe review (a) the current impacts and projected risks of climate change on the health of populations and health systems from extreme weather and climate events and from wildfires, (b) the value of disaster management to reduce health risks from these changes, and (c) adaptation and mitigation measures that can explicitly address climate change in policies and planning processes.\nGlobal land surface air temperature has risen 1.53\u00b0C since the preindustrial period of 1850\u20131900, with considerable variation in regional warming; this increase is much larger than the observed warming combined over land and oceans (0.87\u00b0C) (84).

NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Information.\nAccording to the annual report from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, 2024 was the warmest year since global records began in 1850. The global average surface temperature was 2.32 Fahrenheit (1.29 degrees Celsius) above the 20th-century average (57.0 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.9 degrees Celsius) and 2.63 degrees Fahrenheit (1.46 degrees Celsius) above the pre-industrial average (56.7 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.7 degrees Celsius), which NOAA defines as the period from 1850-1900.\nGlobal temperatures in 2024 were above the 1991-2020 average (red) across most of the planet. Yearly temperatures compared to the 20th-century average (bar chart) show that it has been 48 years since Earth had a cooler-than-average year. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe 2024 global temperature anomaly (anomaly means \u201cdifference from average\u201d) is 0.18 degrees F (0.10 degrees C) warmer than the previous record, set the year before, in 2023. The ten warmest years in the 175-year record have all occurred during the last decade (2015\u20132024). When the new century started in 2000, the first year to set a new high-temperature record was 2005. Now, 2005 is just the 13th-warmest year on record.\nOther 2024 rankings included...\nFor more regional details and 2024 climate statistics, see the 2024 Global Climate Report from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe global average surface temperature is an indicator of the state of Earth\u2019s energy balance: how much sunlight it absorbs minus how much heat it radiates back to space. When these amounts are the same, Earth\u2019s average surface temperature remains steady. When they are out of balance, Earth cools or warms. Earth\u2019s average surface temperature has been rising because human-produced greenhouse gases are causing Earth to absorb more energy than it radiates back to space.\nGiven the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of added heat energy to raise Earth\u2019s average surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree-Fahrenheit (1-degree-Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1850-1900 in NOAA's record) might seem small, but it represents a significant increase in heat energy circulating through all parts of the Earth system, including the oceans, frozen landscapes, and the atmosphere.\nBeyond being an indicator of changes in Earth\u2019s energy balance, surface temperature matters because it controls many environmental and ecological processes that are important to humans and other life, including the water cycle (evaporation, clouds, surface water supplies, and precipitation), the carbon cycle, and the kinds of plants, animals, and other living things that can survive in different places on Earth.\nThe concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (55 degrees Celsius) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the \"average\" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget, which can only be directly measured from space.\nTo calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute temperature readings to temperature anomalies\u2014the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend.\nAcross inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and known physical relationships\u2014such as the way temperature decreases with altitude\u2014to estimate the missing values. Each value is then used to calculate a global-scale temperature anomaly. This process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in Earth's surface temperature over time. Read more about how the global surface temperature record is built in our Climate Data Primer.\nTemperature change has not been uniform across the planet, but more areas are warming than cooling. And the rate of warming has accelerated in recent decades. According to NOAA's 2024 Annual Climate Report the combined land and ocean temperature has warmed at an average rate of 0.11 degrees Fahrenheit (0.06 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1850 and more than three times that rate (0.36 degrees Fahrenheit, or 0.20 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1975.\nRecent rates of global warming (1994-2024, bottom) are larger than the longer-term average rates (1901-2024, top). Places that have cooled are colored blue; places that have warmed are colored yellow, orange, or red. In the past three decades, many places in the Northern Hemisphere have warmed by 1 degree Fahrenheit or more per decade. Differences are most dramatic in the Arctic. With the decline of ice and snow, the Arctic reflects less incoming sunlight, which amplifies the rate of greenhouse-gas-driven warming. NOAA Climate.gov, based o\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Now, 2005 is just the 13th-warmest year on record.\nOther 2024 rankings included...\nFor more regional details and 2024 climate statistics, see the 2024 Global Climate Report from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe global average surface temperature is an indicator of the state of Earth\u2019s energy balance: how much sunlight it absorbs minus how much heat it radiates back to space. When these amounts are the same, Earth\u2019s average surface temperature remains steady. When they are out of balance, Earth cools or warms. Earth\u2019s average surface temperature has been rising because human-produced greenhouse gases are causing Earth to absorb more energy than it radiates back to space.\nGiven the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of added heat energy to raise Earth\u2019s average surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree-Fahrenheit (1-degree-Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1850-1900 in NOAA's record) might seem small, but it represents a significant increase in heat energy circulating through all parts of the Earth system, including the oceans, frozen landscapes, and the atmosphere.\nBeyond being an indicator of changes in Earth\u2019s energy balance, surface temperature matters because it controls many environmental and ecological processes that are important to humans and other life, including the water cycle (evaporation, clouds, surface water supplies, and precipitation), the carbon cycle, and the kinds of plants, animals, and other living things that can survive in different places on Earth.\nThe concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (55 degrees Celsius) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the \"average\" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget, which can only be directly measured from space.\nTo calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute temperature readings to temperature anomalies\u2014the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend.\nAcross inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and known physical relationships\u2014such as the way temperature decreases with altitude\u2014to estimate the missing values. Each value is then used to calculate a global-scale temperature anomaly. This process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in Earth's surface temperature over time. Read more about how the global surface temperature record is built in our Climate Data Primer.\nTemperature change has not been uniform across the planet, but more areas are warming than cooling. And the rate of warming has accelerated in recent decades. According to NOAA's 2024 Annual Climate Report the combined land and ocean temperature has warmed at an average rate of 0.11 degrees Fahrenheit (0.06 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1850 and more than three times that rate (0.36 degrees Fahrenheit, or 0.20 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1975.\nRecent rates of global warming (1994-2024, bottom) are larger than the longer-term average rates (1901-2024, top). Places that have cooled are colored blue; places that have warmed are colored yellow, orange, or red. In the past three decades, many places in the Northern Hemisphere have warmed by 1 degree Fahrenheit or more per decade. Differences are most dramatic in the Arctic. With the decline of ice and snow, the Arctic reflects less incoming sunlight, which amplifies the rate of greenhouse-gas-driven warming. NOAA Climate.gov, based o\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

To assess the current chance of recurrence, we use a large climate model ensemble approach and find the 2023 return period to be 1-in-24 years (1/20\u20131/29 years confidence interval). However, the likelihood of 40\u00b0C has been accelerating and we estimate a 50\u201350 chance of another exceedance in the next 12 years, 4 years earlier than in a static 2023 climate. Far higher temperatures \u2013 over 45\u00b0C \u2013 and more sustained heatwaves may be possible today. Improved understanding of baseline exposure to temperature extremes could inform strategic heatwave preparation.\nEurope witnessed its warmest summer to date in 2022 (Ballester et al., 2023), marked with a series of intense heatwaves throughout the season. During one of these, on 19 July, temperatures above 40\u00b0C were recorded in the UK for the first time over multiple locations in the southeast of the country, part of a spatially extensive event (Kendon et al., 2023). The highest temperature, 40.3\u00b0C, recorded at Coningsby, Lincolnshire, superseded by a large margin the previous maximum of 38.7\u00b0C from 25 July 2019. The unprecedented temperatures led to a range of impacts, including wildfire (Thompson et al., 2025), disruption to the rail network and power systems and on health and healthcare services (Kendon et al., 2023). In advance of the event, the highest level of Heat-Health Alert was issued by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) for the first time since becoming operational in 2004. The link between high temperatures and increased mortality is well established (e.g. Basu and Samet, 2002; Ebi et al., 2021), including for the UK (Arbuthnott and Hajat, 2017), and heat-related mortality has risen rapidly over recent years (L\u00fcthi et al., 2023). The UKHSA reported close to 3000 heat-related excess deaths in England over summer 2022 (UKHSA, 2024) and during 4 days around the peak of the heatwave, 17\u201320 July, there were over 1000 excess deaths in the most vulnerable age group (65+ years) (ONS and UKHSA, 2022). Preparedness has a critical role in reducing heat-related deaths (Ebi et al., 2021; Lo et al., 2022) and strategic planning efforts \u2013 in health and in other sectors \u2013 could benefit from better information on the characteristics of hot extremes. This is the case not just for the decades to come, but now and in the near term, a requirement underlined by the extreme \u2013 and unprecedented \u2013 episodes of recent summers.\nThe possibility of exceeding 40\u00b0C in the UK was mooted a few years ago, using a multimodel analysis (Christidis et al., 2020). A low probability was estimated for the 2020s, with a return time of 100\u2013300 years, although this is likely to be conservative given that models have been reported to underestimate trends in summer extreme temperatures in northwest Europe (e.g. Patterson, 2023; Vautard et al., 2023). Now this threshold has been surpassed, the question arises of when we should expect a repeat \u2013 could this happen again in the climate of today and in upcoming years? There are a few approaches available for estimating current chances of exceeding a threshold. Using observational data alone, making a well-characterised estimate via statistical methods is possible. However, it relies not only on the observations being a good sample of the underlying climate but also that we understand the structure of the underlying climate and can represent it in the statistical model. The UNSEEN (UNprecedented Simulated Extremes using ENsembles, Thompson et al., 2017) approach is not bounded by these assumptions, but instead uses physically based modelling that can capture a wide range of plausible climate outcomes in a changing climate, including those that have not occurred in our more limited observational sample. Initialised ensembles, used in near-term climate predictions, offer a large synthetic event set that provides a much fuller representation of today's climate. It better samples extreme events and hence enables a more robust assessment of the chance of seeing those extremes.\nWestern Europe is recognised as a global hotspot of increasing heatwaves (e.g. Kornhuber et al., 2024) and dynamical processes are thought to contribute to enhanced observed trends in this region (Rousi et al., 2022; Vautard et al., 2023). With the climate model ensemble, we can examine the dynamics of a larger sample of UK hot extremes and compare the model circulation patterns with the observations. Given computational limitations, obtaining information on both the statistics and physics of extreme events, as the UNSEEN method allows, is something that few approaches can offer (Finkel and O'Gorman, 2024).\nHere we describe the application of the UNSEEN approach to summertime daily maximum temperatures in the UK. It is used to give an estimate of the likelihood of exceeding 40\u00b0C in the climate of today, and how that has changed over the last few decades. Taking the opportunity presented by the large set of simulated summers, we describe other measures of hot extremes over southeast England: hot day frequency and heatwave duration, and how these have changed over time. We also present storylines of the evolution of daily maximum temperatures across the summer season that could have applications in impacts modelling and for stress testing. Finally, we examine the broader atmospheric conditions associated with hot extremes over the UK.\nDaily maximum air temperatures (Tmax) for the summer season (June\u2013July\u2013August, JJA), 1960\u20132023, are used in this study (92 days \u00d7 64 years).

To assess the current chance of recurrence, we use a large climate model ensemble approach and find the 2023 return period to be 1-in-24 years (1/20\u20131/29 years confidence interval). However, the likelihood of 40\u00b0C has been accelerating and we estimate a 50\u201350 chance of another exceedance in the next 12 years, 4 years earlier than in a static 2023 climate. Far higher temperatures \u2013 over 45\u00b0C \u2013 and more sustained heatwaves may be possible today. Improved understanding of baseline exposure to temperature extremes could inform strategic heatwave preparation.\nEurope witnessed its warmest summer to date in 2022 (Ballester et al., 2023), marked with a series of intense heatwaves throughout the season. During one of these, on 19 July, temperatures above 40\u00b0C were recorded in the UK for the first time over multiple locations in the southeast of the country, part of a spatially extensive event (Kendon et al., 2023). The highest temperature, 40.3\u00b0C, recorded at Coningsby, Lincolnshire, superseded by a large margin the previous maximum of 38.7\u00b0C from 25 July 2019. The unprecedented temperatures led to a range of impacts, including wildfire (Thompson et al., 2025), disruption to the rail network and power systems and on health and healthcare services (Kendon et al., 2023). In advance of the event, the highest level of Heat-Health Alert was issued by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) for the first time since becoming operational in 2004. The link between high temperatures and increased mortality is well established (e.g. Basu and Samet, 2002; Ebi et al., 2021), including for the UK (Arbuthnott and Hajat, 2017), and heat-related mortality has risen rapidly over recent years (L\u00fcthi et al., 2023). The UKHSA reported close to 3000 heat-related excess deaths in England over summer 2022 (UKHSA, 2024) and during 4 days around the peak of the heatwave, 17\u201320 July, there were over 1000 excess deaths in the most vulnerable age group (65+ years) (ONS and UKHSA, 2022). Preparedness has a critical role in reducing heat-related deaths (Ebi et al., 2021; Lo et al., 2022) and strategic planning efforts \u2013 in health and in other sectors \u2013 could benefit from better information on the characteristics of hot extremes. This is the case not just for the decades to come, but now and in the near term, a requirement underlined by the extreme \u2013 and unprecedented \u2013 episodes of recent summers.\nThe possibility of exceeding 40\u00b0C in the UK was mooted a few years ago, using a multimodel analysis (Christidis et al., 2020). A low probability was estimated for the 2020s, with a return time of 100\u2013300 years, although this is likely to be conservative given that models have been reported to underestimate trends in summer extreme temperatures in northwest Europe (e.g. Patterson, 2023; Vautard et al., 2023). Now this threshold has been surpassed, the question arises of when we should expect a repeat \u2013 could this happen again in the climate of today and in upcoming years? There are a few approaches available for estimating current chances of exceeding a threshold. Using observational data alone, making a well-characterised estimate via statistical methods is possible. However, it relies not only on the observations being a good sample of the underlying climate but also that we understand the structure of the underlying climate and can represent it in the statistical model. The UNSEEN (UNprecedented Simulated Extremes using ENsembles, Thompson et al., 2017) approach is not bounded by these assumptions, but instead uses physically based modelling that can capture a wide range of plausible climate outcomes in a changing climate, including those that have not occurred in our more limited observational sample. Initialised ensembles, used in near-term climate predictions, offer a large synthetic event set that provides a much fuller representation of today's climate. It better samples extreme events and hence enables a more robust assessment of the chance of seeing those extremes.\nWestern Europe is recognised as a global hotspot of increasing heatwaves (e.g. Kornhuber et al., 2024) and dynamical processes are thought to contribute to enhanced observed trends in this region (Rousi et al., 2022; Vautard et al., 2023). With the climate model ensemble, we can examine the dynamics of a larger sample of UK hot extremes and compare the model circulation patterns with the observations. Given computational limitations, obtaining information on both the statistics and physics of extreme events, as the UNSEEN method allows, is something that few approaches can offer (Finkel and O'Gorman, 2024).\nHere we describe the application of the UNSEEN approach to summertime daily maximum temperatures in the UK. It is used to give an estimate of the likelihood of exceeding 40\u00b0C in the climate of today, and how that has changed over the last few decades. Taking the opportunity presented by the large set of simulated summers, we describe other measures of hot extremes over southeast England: hot day frequency and heatwave duration, and how these have changed over time. We also present storylines of the evolution of daily maximum temperatures across the summer season that could have applications in impacts modelling and for stress testing. Finally, we examine the broader atmospheric conditions associated with hot extremes over the UK.\nDaily maximum air temperatures (Tmax) for the summer season (June\u2013July\u2013August, JJA), 1960\u20132023, are used in this study (92 days \u00d7 64 years).

But as climate change makes heat waves more intense and more frequent, we need to be cognizant of the dangers and health risks that come with it.\nOver the coming decades, every region of the US is expected to experience hotter temperatures and more frequent and intense heat waves. This worsening heat poses serious health risks, especially for the very young and elderly, construction and agricultural workers, and those living in the core of urban areas.\nThese two companion fact sheets summarize:\n\u201cHeat wave,\u201d \u201cexcessive heat event,\u201d \u201cheat advisory,\u201d \u201chot spell\u201d\u2014extreme heat has many different names but generally refers to temperatures that are either exceptionally high relative to typical local conditions or reach levels that may be harmful to human health or infrastructure. When extreme daytime temperatures persist over a prolonged period (usually at least two days), it is often referred to as a heat wave.\nThe human body sweats to cool itself when exposed to high temperatures. In humid conditions, sweat does not evaporate as quickly and the body\u2019s ability to cool itself is compromised. Heat stress can result and, if not addressed, can lead to heat-related illnesses like heat exhaustion and heat stroke. The impacts of temperature extremes on human health and well-being are therefore generally considered in concert with humidity to measure heat stress conditions: those in which the human body has difficulty cooling itself.\nExtreme heat events can be measured in a few different ways: the maximum temperatures hit (intensity), how often the events occur (frequency), or how long they last (duration). The Dust Bowl era of the 1930s holds the record for peak frequency, intensity, and duration of heat waves across much of the United States to this day\u2014but the frequency and intensity of heat waves have increased in the last several decades in many regions.\nIn addition to changes in extreme temperatures alone, studies of heat stress trends over the late 20th to early 21st century found increases across much of the country in the conditions that cause heat stress for humans. In a study of changes in extreme heat stress conditions at 187 weather stations across the US between 1949 and 2005, 20 percent of the stations had recorded a substantial increase in the number of one-day, extreme heat stress events (relative to local conditions between 1961 and 1990). On average, these stations recorded 12 more days with extreme heat stress per year in 2005 than they did in 1949.\nIn the next few decades, if carbon emissions continue to grow, most of the country could see 20 to 30 more days annually with maximum temperatures above 90 degrees Fahrenheit. The Southeast could be hit even harder, potentially enduring 40 to 50 more such days.\nBy 2100, all parts of the United States are likely to experience more heat waves, with the Southeast, Southwest, and Alaska likely to see the biggest increases. Not only will these heat waves be more frequent, they will also be hotter than what we experience today. If carbon emissions continue to increase substantially, the hottest daily temperatures that occur in a given year in the United States are likely to increase by at least 10\u00b0F as compared to the end of the 20th century.\nHeat is among the deadliest extreme weather hazards in the United States. When exposure to heat is high enough to raise the body's core temperature, heat stress illness\u2014which encompasses heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke\u2014can occur.\nWith heat cramps, an individual experiences muscle pain or spasms. Heat exhaustion can cause dizziness, a weak pulse, nausea, and fainting. The most severe heat-related illness, heat stroke, occurs when a person\u2019s temperature increases above 103\u00b0F. Increased daily air temperatures or periods of extended high temperatures have also been shown to increase cardiovascular mortality, respiratory mortality, and heart attacks.\nSome US residents are at greater risk of adverse health effects and death from extreme heat. Low-income residents, the young and elderly, construction and agricultural workers, individuals with pre-existing medical conditions, and people living in the center of urban areas can be more vulnerable to physical harm from heat.\nExtreme heat can affect many aspects of daily life and routines, including:\nBy stabilizing global carbon emissions in the next few decades (so that atmospheric carbon dioxide remains below 550 parts per million by 2100), the frequency of heat waves the US is likely to see around mid-century would be reduced by approximately 50 percent, compared to a scenario in which carbon emissions continue to increase rapidly through to 2100.\nIf the global community pursues aggressive emissions reductions in line with the Paris Agreement goal of keeping warming below 3.6\u00b0F, the hottest daily temperatures that occur each year in many parts of the country are likely to increase by just 3.6\u00b0F instead of by 10\u00b0F, as compared to the higher-emissions scenario.\nIndividuals and communities need policies and infrastructure that take better account of more frequent, intense, and longer-lasting extreme heat. For example, in the coming decades increased reliance on air conditioning to cope with extreme heat is likely to contribute to increased global warming emissions, worsening air quality, and an increase in air pollution\u2013related mortality unless we more aggressively invest in clean energy technology, energy conservation, and energy efficiency measures.\nExisting policies also need to be leveraged and new policies enacted to better help people\u2014particularly outdoor workers, children, low-income and minority groups, elderly people, and athletes\u2014to cope with extreme heat. Policies that ensure the safety of all outdoor workers, documented or otherwise, and expand access to and awareness of \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

These events and events influenced by climate change, such as wildfires, continue to cause significant human morbidity and mortality and adversely affect mental health and well-being. Although adverse health impacts from extreme events declined over the past few decades, climate change and more people moving into harm\u2019s way could alter this trend. Long-term changes to Earth\u2019s energy balance are increasing the frequency and intensity of many extreme events and the probability of compound events, with trends projected to accelerate under certain greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. While most of these events cannot be completely avoided, many of the health risks could be prevented through building climate-resilient health systems with improved risk reduction, preparation, response, and recovery. Conducting vulnerability and adaptation assessments and developing health system adaptation plans can identify priority actions to effectively reduce risks, such as disaster risk management and more resilient infrastructure. The risks are urgent, so action is needed now.\nKeywords: climate change, climate variability, extreme events, population health, health systems\nWorldwide, in 2019, there were 396 disasters1 that killed 11,755 people, affected 95 million others, and cost nearly US$130 billion (28). Asia was the most affected continent with 40% of the events, 45% of the deaths, and 74% of all people affected. Floods and storms accounted for 68% of the number of affected people worldwide. Anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, land use change, and other activities impacting the global energy balance are altering the frequency and intensity of many extreme weather and climate events, with some regions experiencing increases in heat waves, floods, and droughts (84). Events influenced by climate change, particularly wildfires, also are increasing.\nRisks from extreme weather and climate events arise from the intersection of the physical hazard (e.g., wind and rain), the extent of exposure to the hazard, the vulnerability of individuals and communities, and the capacity to prepare for, manage, and recover from extreme events.\nA disaster generally is defined as a sudden, calamitous event that disrupts the functioning of a community or society and that exceeds its ability to cope using its own resources (81). The occurrence of an extreme event is not required for a community or region to experience extreme impacts, such as large increase in mortality; an extreme impact can arise from a moderately strong event when it occurs in a highly vulnerable population. The converse also is true, that an extreme event may not result in extreme impacts when communities are prepared.\nRoughly 20% of disasters in 2019 occurred in North America, including the Caribbean and Central America, for total damages of US$55 billion, of which US$29 billion were insured (130). Loss events included Hurricane Dorian, which caused billions of dollars in damage, especially in the Bahamas, in late August to early September. Heavy losses that year also resulted from severe weather, floods, and a winter storm in the United States. A mixture of snowmelt triggered by unusually high temperatures in March and storms with torrential rain led to sustained and extensive flooding in Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, and Mississippi (49).\nOverall, the numbers and costs of disasters have been increasing for several decades due to increases in exposure (more people moving into harm\u2019s way and increases in the values of property and infrastructure at risk), vulnerability of people and infrastructure, and climate change (170). Since 1980, the United States has experienced 265 weather and climate disasters in which the overall damages reached or exceeded US$1 billion; the total costs were greater than US$1.775 trillion (132), with an estimated 14,223 deaths (an average of 356 per year), although the numbers of deaths are likely an underestimate (178).\nBeyond the damage to infrastructure, extreme weather events and disasters can affect the health and well-being of individuals and can have catastrophic impacts on communities and health systems. People can suffer from a wide range of physical effects (e.g., heat exhaustion, injuries in severe storms, and respiratory illnesses from molds due to floods) as well as longer-term impacts on mental health. Health systems and facilities can be affected by impacts on patients and health care staff, medical and nonmedical supplies, facility operations, and critical infrastructures. To prepare for climate change, health-sector and emergency-management officials\u2014as well as urban planners, neighborhood services staff, and others\u2014require information about how hazards are projected to change, possible future exposures of people and property, likely changes in population health and health care infrastructure vulnerabilities, and needed capacities to prepare for and manage the events and their aftermath.\nWe review (a) the current impacts and projected risks of climate change on the health of populations and health systems from extreme weather and climate events and from wildfires, (b) the value of disaster management to reduce health risks from these changes, and (c) adaptation and mitigation measures that can explicitly address climate change in policies and planning processes.\nGlobal land surface air temperature has risen 1.53\u00b0C since the preindustrial period of 1850\u20131900, with considerable variation in regional warming; this increase is much larger than the observed warming combined over land and oceans (0.87\u00b0C) (84).

Content is not being updated or maintained, and some links may no longer work.\nThe modern record of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels began with observations recorded at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. This graph shows the station's monthly average carbon dioxide measurements since 1958 in parts per million (ppm). The seasonal cycle of highs and lows (small peaks and valleys) is driven by Northern Hemisphere summer vegetation growth, which reduces atmospheric carbon dioxide, and winter decay, which increases it. The long-term trend of rising carbon dioxide levels is driven by human activities. At Mauna Loa, the highest monthly value each year occurs in May. In May 2024, carbon dioxide hit just under 427 ppm\u2014a new record. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on Mauna Loa monthly mean data from NOAA Global Monitoring Lab.\nBased on the annual analysis from NOAA\u2019s Global Monitoring Lab, global average atmospheric carbon dioxide was 422.8 parts per million (\u201cppm,\u201d for short) in 2024, a new record high. The increase during 2024 was 3.75 ppm\u2014the largest one-year increase on record. At Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii (graph above), where the modern carbon dioxide record began in 1958, the annual average carbon dioxide in 2024 was 424.61 ppm, also a new record.\nThe years with the largest annual carbon dioxide growth tend to be associated with the strongest El Ni\u00f1os\u2014the warm phase of a natural climate pattern in the tropical Pacific\u2014which lead to high temperatures over land and sea and an expansion of global drought area. In turn, these weather conditions typically lead to less plant growth, which reduces carbon dioxide uptake, as well as increased decomposition of carbon in soil and increased carbon dioxide emissions from forest fires. Together, these impacts cause atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to rise faster than normal.\nEven though the 2023-24 El Ni\u00f1o had waned by April, record high air temperatures and drought in all of 2024, similar to those during an El Nino, were likely drivers of the large increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide in 2024. In addition to other factors, large forest fires in both the Amazon and Canada contributed to the 2024 global increase.\nCarbon dioxide concentrations are rising mostly because of the fossil fuels that people have been burning for energy since the start of the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuels like coal and oil contain the carbon from millions of years of photosynthesis\u2014the process by which plants remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. We are returning that carbon to the atmosphere in just a few hundred years. Since the middle of the 20th century, annual emissions of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels have increased every decade, from close to 11 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year in the 1960s to an estimated 37.4 billion tons in 2024 according to the Global Carbon Budget 2024.\nThe amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (blue line) has increased along with human emissions (gray line) since the start of the Industrial Revolution in 1750. Emissions rose slowly to about 5 gigatons (1 gigaton is 1 billion metric tons per year) in the mid-20th century before rapidly increasing to more than 35 billion tons per year by the end of the century. NOAA Climate.gov graph, adapted from original by Dr. Howard Diamond (NOAA ARL). Atmospheric carbon dioxide data from NOAA and ETHZ. Carbon dioxide emissions data from Our World in Data and the Global Carbon Project.\nCarbon cycle experts estimate that natural \u201csinks,\u201d including plant growth and ocean absorption, remove about half of carbon dioxide humans emit into the atmosphere from fossil fuel burning. The rest stays in the atmosphere. Every year, we are adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than natural sinks can remove, and so the total amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere goes up. The bigger the overshoot, the faster atmospheric carbon dioxide increases.\nIn the 1960s, atmospheric carbon dioxide increased by about 0.8 ppm per year on average. That growth rate doubled to an average of 1.6 ppm per year in the 1980s and 1.5 ppm per year in the 1990s. In the last decade (2015-2024), the annual increase has accelerated to 2.6 ppm per year. As a result, the annual rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide over the past 60 years is 100-200 times faster than the increase that occurred at the end of the last ice age 11,000-17,000 years ago.\nCarbon dioxide is Earth\u2019s most important long-lived greenhouse gas: a gas that absorbs and radiates heat. Unlike oxygen or nitrogen (which make up most of Earth's atmosphere), greenhouse gases absorb heat radiating from the Earth\u2019s surface and re-release it in all directions\u2014including back toward Earth\u2019s surface. Without any carbon dioxide, Earth\u2019s natural greenhouse effect would be too weak to keep the average global surface temperature above freezing.\nBy adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, people are amplifying the natural greenhouse effect, causing global temperature to rise. According to observations and analysis by the NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory, carbon dioxide alone is responsible for about 80 percent of the total heating influence of all human-produced greenhouse gases since 1990.\nAnother reason carbon dioxide is important in the Earth system is that it dissolves into the ocean like the fizz in a can of soda. It reacts with water molecules, producing carbonic acid and lowering the ocean's pH (raising its acidity). Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, the pH of the ocean's surface waters has dropped from 8.21 to 8.10. This drop in pH is called ocean acidification, and it interferes with the ability of marine life to extract calcium from sea water to build skeletons and shells.\n(left) A healthy ocean snail has a transparent shell with smoothly contoured ridges.

    "input_prompt": "Claim:\nIncreased human consumption of fossil fuels since the industrial revolution has led to more greenhouse gases being released.\n\nArticle Title:\nThe History of Carbon Dioxide Emissions | World Resources Institute\n\nGoogle Search Snippet:\nRecent data reveals that global CO2 emissions were 182 times higher in 2022 than they were in 1850, around the time the Industrial Revolution was underway.\n\nFull Page Content:\nThis website is an ARCHIVED version of NOAA Climate.gov as of June 25, 2025. Content is not being updated or maintained, and some links may no longer work.\nThe modern record of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels began with observations recorded at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. This graph shows the station's monthly average carbon dioxide measurements since 1958 in parts per million (ppm). The seasonal cycle of highs and lows (small peaks and valleys) is driven by Northern Hemisphere summer vegetation growth, which reduces atmospheric carbon dioxide, and winter decay, which increases it. The long-term trend of rising carbon dioxide levels is driven by human activities. At Mauna Loa, the highest monthly value each year occurs in May. In May 2024, carbon dioxide hit just under 427 ppm\u2014a new record. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on Mauna Loa monthly mean data from NOAA Global Monitoring Lab.\nBased on the annual analysis from NOAA\u2019s Global Monitoring Lab, global average atmospheric carbon dioxide was 422.8 parts per million (\u201cppm,\u201d for short) in 2024, a new record high. The increase during 2024 was 3.75 ppm\u2014the largest one-year increase on record. At Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii (graph above), where the modern carbon dioxide record began in 1958, the annual average carbon dioxide in 2024 was 424.61 ppm, also a new record.\nThe years with the largest annual carbon dioxide growth tend to be associated with the strongest El Ni\u00f1os\u2014the warm phase of a natural climate pattern in the tropical Pacific\u2014which lead to high temperatures over land and sea and an expansion of global drought area. In turn, these weather conditions typically lead to less plant growth, which reduces carbon dioxide uptake, as well as increased decomposition of carbon in soil and increased carbon dioxide emissions from forest fires. Together, these impacts cause atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to rise faster than normal.\nEven though the 2023-24 El Ni\u00f1o had waned by April, record high air temperatures and drought in all of 2024, similar to those during an El Nino, were likely drivers of the large increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide in 2024. In addition to other factors, large forest fires in both the Amazon and Canada contributed to the 2024 global increase.\nCarbon dioxide concentrations are rising mostly because of the fossil fuels that people have been burning for energy since the start of the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuels like coal and oil contain the carbon from millions of years of photosynthesis\u2014the process by which plants remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. We are returning that carbon to the atmosphere in just a few hundred years. Since the middle of the 20th century, annual emissions of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels have increased every decade, from close to 11 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year in the 1960s to an estimated 37.4 billion tons in 2024 according to the Global Carbon Budget 2024.\nThe amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (blue line) has increased along with human emissions (gray line) since the start of the Industrial Revolution in 1750. Emissions rose slowly to about 5 gigatons (1 gigaton is 1 billion metric tons per year) in the mid-20th century before rapidly increasing to more than 35 billion tons per year by the end of the century. NOAA Climate.gov graph, adapted from original by Dr. Howard Diamond (NOAA ARL). Atmospheric carbon dioxide data from NOAA and ETHZ. Carbon dioxide emissions data from Our World in Data and the Global Carbon Project.\nCarbon cycle experts estimate that natural \u201csinks,\u201d including plant growth and ocean absorption, remove about half of carbon dioxide humans emit into the atmosphere from fossil fuel burning. The rest stays in the atmosphere. Every year, we are adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than natural sinks can remove, and so the total amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere goes up. The bigger the overshoot, the faster atmospheric carbon dioxide increases.\nIn the 1960s, atmospheric carbon dioxide increased by about 0.8 ppm per year on average. That growth rate doubled to an average of 1.6 ppm per year in the 1980s and 1.5 ppm per year in the 1990s. In the last decade (2015-2024), the annual increase has accelerated to 2.6 ppm per year. As a result, the annual rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide over the past 60 years is 100-200 times faster than the increase that occurred at the end of the last ice age 11,000-17,000 years ago.\nCarbon dioxide is Earth\u2019s most important long-lived greenhouse gas: a gas that absorbs and radiates heat. Unlike oxygen or nitrogen (which make up most of Earth's atmosphere), greenhouse gases absorb heat radiating from the Earth\u2019s surface and re-release it in all directions\u2014including back toward Earth\u2019s surface. Without any carbon dioxide, Earth\u2019s natural greenhouse effect would be too weak to keep the average global surface temperature above freezing.\nBy adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, people are amplifying the natural greenhouse effect, causing global temperature to rise. According to observations and analysis by the NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory, carbon dioxide alone is responsible for about 80 percent of the total heating influence of all human-produced greenhouse gases since 1990.\nAnother reason carbon dioxide is important in the Earth system is that it dissolves into the ocean like the fizz in a can of soda. It reacts with water molecules, producing carbonic acid and lowering the ocean's pH (raising its acidity). Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, the pH of the ocean's surface waters has dropped from 8.21 to 8.10. This drop in pH is called ocean acidification, and it interferes with the ability of marine life to extract calcium from sea water to build skeletons and shells.\n(left) A healthy ocean snail has a transparent shell with smoothly contoured ridges. (right) A shell exposed to more acidic, corrosive waters is cloudy, ragged, and pockmarked wit\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",
