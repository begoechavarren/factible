    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\n\u201cGive me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free\u2026\u201d These poetic lines, engraved on a bronze plaque beneath the Statue of Liberty, speak to who we are: a nation of immigrants. Until now . . . As Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer lamented, \u201cTears are running down the cheeks of the Statue of Liberty.\u201d We\u2019ve turned our backs on those huddled masses. Closed our borders. Separated families. Hardened our hearts. Or so you would think if you only read the headlines or watch TV news. Just one problem: It\u2019s not true. The United States still maintains the most generous immigration policies in the world. Generous to a fault...because the overwhelming numbers have stymied our ability to assimilate the huddled masses. 50 million residents of America are foreign-born. In fact, today the United States has more immigrants as a percentage of its total population than at any time since 1890. That\u2019s why, to give one illustration, 176 different languages are spoken among students in the New York City school system. How did we get here? For starters, America grants permanent residence to a million people every single year. And that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg because of something you\u2019ve probably heard referred to as \u201cchain migration.\u201d Chain migration allows immigrants to sponsor not only their immediate family\u2014parents, spouses and children under age 21, but much of their extended family once they gain citizenship: unmarried adult children and any children they might have, married adult children and their children, and brothers and sisters and their children. Princeton University researchers, using the most recently available data, found that immigrants sponsored an average of 3.45 additional relatives each. So, the one million immigrants granted permanent residence each year potentially adds, over time, another three and a half million. In addition, an estimated 100,000 refugees and asylum-seekers\u2014people who claim to be fleeing political or personal strife abroad\u2014enter the country annually. From 2008 to 2017, the U.S. gave green cards to well over a million people for humanitarian reasons, allowing them to live and work here permanently. After five years, they can apply for full citizenship. We\u2019re not done yet. In that same time frame, nearly half a million more people came to America through the diversity visa lottery\u2014a program designed to admit more people from \u201cunderrepresented\u201d countries into the U.S. Diversity visa applicants don't need a high school education, job skills \u2014or pretty much anything. And, thanks again to chain migration, spouses and unmarried children under 21 of visa lottery winners also get to come to America. This non-stop flow of new legal immigrants\u2014based on family ties instead of skills, abilities, and allegiance to American values\u2014has, of course, been supplemented by millions who enter the country illegally and stay illegally. Dominant media outlets use the euphemism \u201cundocumented,\u201d but the official U.S. government term used in federal statutes is \u201cillegal alien\u201d: an unlawful entrant who came without permission and stays in open defiance of our laws. The number of illegal aliens in the country is usually given as 11 million, but have you noticed that number never seems to change? Common sense suggests it\u2019s higher\u2014much higher. And though illegal aliens themselves don\u2019t qualify for welfare, they receive free health care in our clinics and hospitals, and through their American-born children they can expect to receive all manner of benefits\u2014cash aid, food stamps, and housing vouchers. Their children are entitled to a free education in public schools. Building a high-tech border barrier would certainly help stem this flow. Ending chain migration is another obvious remedy. E-Verify, the national database that allows employers to check workers\u2019 immigration status, is also essential. So is a fully-functioning entry-exit system to track visa overstayers. But all solutions will ultimately fail unless we get control of the numbers and enforce our laws consistently. It\u2019s Sovereignty 101: This is our home and we have not only the right, but the responsibility, to determine who comes in, how many come in, and what qualities and qualifications they bring. The truth is, we let in millions. And, of course, millions more want to come. Who can blame them? But it\u2019s simply not possible or desirable to let in everyone. And it\u2019s not hateful to say so. It\u2019s not hateful to protect our borders. It\u2019s not hateful to protect our citizens. It\u2019s not hateful to protect our values. Lady Liberty may be shedding tears\u2014not because we\u2019ve stopped welcoming immigrants, but because our ill-conceived immigration policies are threatening the American Dream. I\u2019m Michelle Malkin, CRTV host and author of Invasion and Sold Out, for Prager University.",

The Biden administration was also estimated to have naturalized nearly 3.5 million people, the most in any presidential term; more than doubled the length of work authorizations; and recrafted interior enforcement priorities to target national security and public safety threats, and recent border crossers. Additionally, the administration extended Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to 1.7 million potential new beneficiaries (although far fewer received the status), offering them work authorization and protection from deportation.

Over 70 million immigrants have arrived in the U.S. since 1965, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of Census Bureau data. About 18 million have come from Mexico, making up the largest wave of immigration from a single country to the U.S.\nIn 2022, the number of immigrants living in the U.S. reached a high of 46.1 million, accounting for 13.8% of the population. (This includes both legal and unauthorized immigrants.)\nThese immigrants trace their roots to virtually all countries around the world. The largest numbers hail from Mexico (10.6 million) and India (2.8 million). That\u2019s different from a century ago: In 1920, the largest immigrant populations were from Germany and Italy.\nThe share of immigrants varies widely among states, from 2% in West Virginia to 27% in California. In 2022, Mexican immigrants were the largest group in 29 states, while Indian immigrants were the largest group in six states.\nMirroring the national trend, the origins of immigrants living in each state have changed dramatically in the past century. In 1920, the largest immigrant groups in 29 states were born in Germany, Italy or Canada. And only six states had the same largest origin group in 2022 that they did in 1920: Arizona, New Mexico and Texas (all from Mexico) and Maine, Montana and Vermont (from Canada).\nReasons behind the changes in the U.S. immigrant population since 1965 include:\n1840-1889\nThe first large wave of immigration to the U.S. began in the 1840s and lasted until 1889. During this time, more than 14 million immigrants came to the country. Most arrived from Northern or Western Europe; Germany, Ireland and the United Kingdom alone accounted for 70% of the new arrivals.\nHow America\u2019s source of immigrants has changed over time\nTop country of birth among U.S. immigrants, by state\n1850\nTop five foreign-born populations by country of origin (in millions)\nTotal U.S. population 23.2 million Total foreign born 2.2 million Percentage foreign born 9.7%\nNote: Populations rounded to nearest 10,000. Shares and ranks based on unrounded numbers. Germany includes East and West Germany (1980-1990), German states coded by IPUMS (1850-1940). Alsace and Lorraine are part of Germany for 1870-1910 and France in other years. United Kingdom (UK) includes England, Scotland, Wales and Channel Islands in all years and Northern Ireland in 1930 and later.

In 1860, Ireland was the largest origin country in 22 of the nation\u2019s 39 states and territories.\nBy 1880, Germany was the largest origin country in 16 states and territories. Chinese immigrants were the largest group in California, Nevada, Oregon, and the Idaho and Washington territories. Mexicans were the largest group in Texas and the New Mexico and Arizona territories.\n1890-1919\nThe next wave of immigration to the U.S. lasted from 1890 to 1919, when more than 18 million immigrants arrived. By then, over 60% came from Eastern and Southern Europe, with large numbers arriving from Italy, Austria-Hungary, Russia and Poland.\n1920-1964\nThe number of new immigrants fell dramatically in the years between World War I and World War II (1919 to 1939). As a result, the largest immigrant groups in each state did not change much for the next few decades.\nIn 1920, German immigrants were the largest group in 11 states, down from 18 in 1910. Immigrants from Italy and Russia became the largest groups in a growing number of states. At their peaks, Italians were the largest group in 10 states in 1940 and 1960, and Russians were the biggest in seven states in 1920 and 1950.\nBy 1960, the largest number of immigrants in most states came from Germany (17 states), Italy (10) and Canada (10).\n1965-2007\nAnother wave of immigration began in 1965. Most immigrants in this wave came from Latin America (49%) or Asia (27%). Mexico alone accounted for about 25% of these new immigrants. Large numbers also came from China, India, the Philippines, Central America and the Caribbean.\nAfter 1990, the number of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. started to grow quickly, from 3.5 million to 12.2 million in 2007. Most unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. at this time came from Mexico, which was also the largest source of legal immigrants.\nThese new legal and unauthorized arrivals led to major changes in states\u2019 immigrant populations.

Through these executive actions, the Biden administration restored legal immigration levels that had fallen due to the COVID-19 pandemic and earlier Trump initiatives, as well as rebuilt refugee resettlement to numbers not seen since the 1990s. The Biden administration was also estimated to have naturalized nearly 3.5 million people, the most in any presidential term; more than doubled the length of work authorizations; and recrafted interior enforcement priorities to target national security and public safety threats, and recent border crossers. Additionally, the administration extended Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to 1.7 million potential new beneficiaries (although far fewer received the status), offering them work authorization and protection from deportation. To decrease the pressure of irregular arrivals at the U.S.-Mexico border, the administration established new humanitarian pathways and orderly processes for migrants to enter the United States, and built a new network of cooperation with governments across the Americas.\nDespite these developments, the country\u2019s attention throughout Biden\u2019s tenure was focused on the Southwest border, where authorities carried out 8.6 million migrant encounters from January 2021 through October 2024 (many were of repeat crossers).

Even when the administration further narrowed access to asylum at the border in June, the measure was seen as too little, too late.\nAlthough a combination of carrot-and-stick processes and Mexico\u2019s stepped-up enforcement quelled some border pressures, MPI estimates that as of July more than 5.8 million migrants had been paroled in or otherwise allowed entry to pursue asylum applications and other immigration cases.

Over 70 million immigrants have arrived in the U.S. since 1965, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of Census Bureau data. About 18 million have come from Mexico, making up the largest wave of immigration from a single country to the U.S.\nIn 2022, the number of immigrants living in the U.S. reached a high of 46.1 million, accounting for 13.8% of the population. (This includes both legal and unauthorized immigrants.)\nThese immigrants trace their roots to virtually all countries around the world. The largest numbers hail from Mexico (10.6 million) and India (2.8 million). That\u2019s different from a century ago: In 1920, the largest immigrant populations were from Germany and Italy.\nThe share of immigrants varies widely among states, from 2% in West Virginia to 27% in California. In 2022, Mexican immigrants were the largest group in 29 states, while Indian immigrants were the largest group in six states.\nMirroring the national trend, the origins of immigrants living in each state have changed dramatically in the past century. In 1920, the largest immigrant groups in 29 states were born in Germany, Italy or Canada. And only six states had the same largest origin group in 2022 that they did in 1920: Arizona, New Mexico and Texas (all from Mexico) and Maine, Montana and Vermont (from Canada).\nReasons behind the changes in the U.S. immigrant population since 1965 include:\n1840-1889\nThe first large wave of immigration to the U.S. began in the 1840s and lasted until 1889. During this time, more than 14 million immigrants came to the country. Most arrived from Northern or Western Europe; Germany, Ireland and the United Kingdom alone accounted for 70% of the new arrivals.\nHow America\u2019s source of immigrants has changed over time\nTop country of birth among U.S. immigrants, by state\n1850\nTop five foreign-born populations by country of origin (in millions)\nTotal U.S. population 23.2 million Total foreign born 2.2 million Percentage foreign born 9.7%\nNote: Populations rounded to nearest 10,000.

Through these executive actions, the Biden administration restored legal immigration levels that had fallen due to the COVID-19 pandemic and earlier Trump initiatives, as well as rebuilt refugee resettlement to numbers not seen since the 1990s. The Biden administration was also estimated to have naturalized nearly 3.5 million people, the most in any presidential term; more than doubled the length of work authorizations; and recrafted interior enforcement priorities to target national security and public safety threats, and recent border crossers. Additionally, the administration extended Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to 1.7 million potential new beneficiaries (although far fewer received the status), offering them work authorization and protection from deportation. To decrease the pressure of irregular arrivals at the U.S.-Mexico border, the administration established new humanitarian pathways and orderly processes for migrants to enter the United States, and built a new network of cooperation with governments across the Americas.\nDespite these developments, the country\u2019s attention throughout Biden\u2019s tenure was focused on the Southwest border, where authorities carried out 8.6 million migrant encounters from January 2021 through October 2024 (many were of repeat crossers). Biden was hounded by a strong public perception that the border was uncontrolled. Even when the administration further narrowed access to asylum at the border in June, the measure was seen as too little, too late.\nAlthough a combination of carrot-and-stick processes and Mexico\u2019s stepped-up enforcement quelled some border pressures, MPI estimates that as of July more than 5.8 million migrants had been paroled in or otherwise allowed entry to pursue asylum applications and other immigration cases. At times of high arrivals, overwhelmed authorities often had to release migrants into the country due to a lack of asylum screening and other processing resources. In recent months, as encounters have decreased, so too have releases.\nTable 1.

As of January 2025, the United States has the largest immigrant population in the world in absolute terms, with 53.3 million foreign-born residents, representing 15.8% of the total U.S. population\u2014both record highs.[1] While the United States represented about 4% of the total global population in 2024, 17% of all international migrants resided in the United States.[2] In March 2025, the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) estimated that approximately 18.6 million illegal immigrants resided in the United States.[3] In 2024, immigrants and their U.S.-born children number more than 93 million people, or 28% of the total U.S. population.[2] According to the 2016 Yearbook of Immigration Statistics, the United States admitted a total of 1.18 million legal immigrants (618k new arrivals, 565k status adjustments) in 2016.[4] Of these, 48% were the immediate relatives of United States citizens, 20% were family-sponsored, 13% were refugees or asylum seekers, 12% were employment-based preferences, 4.2% were part of the Diversity Immigrant Visa program, 1.4% were victims of a crime (U1) or their family members were (U2 to U5),[5] and 1.0% who were granted the Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) for Iraqis and Afghans employed by the United States Government.[4] The remaining 0.4% included small numbers from several other categories, including 0.2% who were granted suspension of deportation as an immediate relative of a citizen (Z13);[6] persons admitted under the Nicaraguan and Central American Relief Act; children born after the issuance of a parent's visa; and certain parolees from the former Soviet Union, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam who were denied refugee status.[4]\nBetween 1921 and 1965 policies such as the National Origins Formula limited immigration and naturalization opportunities for people from areas outside Northwestern Europe. Exclusion laws enacted as early as the 1880s generally prohibited or severely restricted immigration from Asia, and quota laws enacted in the 1920s curtailed Southern and Eastern European immigration. The civil rights movement led to the replacement[7] of these ethnic quotas with per-country limits for family-sponsored and employment-based preference visas.[8] Between 1970 and 2007, the number of first-generation immigrants living in the United States quadrupled from 9.6 million to 38.1 million residents.[9][10] Census estimates show 45.3 million foreign born residents in the United States as of March 2018 and 45.4 million in September 2021, the lowest three-year increase in decades.[11]\nIn 2017, out of the U.S. foreign-born population, some 45% (20.7 million) were naturalized citizens, 27% (12.3 million) were lawful permanent residents, 6% (2.2 million) were temporary lawful residents, and 23% (10.5 million) were unauthorized immigrants.[12] The United States led the world in refugee resettlement for decades, admitting more refugees than the rest of the world combined.[13]\nCauses of migration include poverty, crime[14][15] and environmental degradation.[16]\nSome research suggests that immigration is beneficial to the United States economy. With few exceptions, the evidence suggests that on average, immigration has positive economic effects on the native population, but it is mixed as to whether low-skilled immigration adversely affects low-skilled natives. Studies also show that immigrants have lower crime rates than natives in the United States.[17][18][19] The economic, social, and political aspects of immigration have caused controversy regarding such issues as maintaining ethnic homogeneity, workers for employers versus jobs for non-immigrants, settlement patterns, impact on upward social mobility, crime, and voting behavior.\nDue to its history the United States can be described as an immigration country. American immigration history can be viewed in four epochs: the colonial period, the mid-19th century, the start of the 20th century, and post-1965. Each period brought distinct national groups, races, and ethnicities to the United States.\nDuring the 17th century, approximately 400,000 English people migrated to America under European colonization.[20] They comprised 83.5% of the white population at the time of the first census in 1790.[21] From 1700 to 1775, between 350,000 and 500,000 Europeans immigrated: estimates vary in sources. Regarding English settlers of the 18th century, one source says 52,000 English migrated during the period of 1701 to 1775, although this figure is likely too low.[22][23] 400,000\u2013450,000 of the 18th-century migrants were Scots, Scots-Irish from Ulster, Germans, Swiss, and French Huguenots.[24] Over half of all European immigrants to Colonial America during the 17th and 18th centuries arrived as indentured servants.[25] They numbered 350,000.[26] From 1770 to 1775 (the latter year being when the American Revolutionary War began), 7,000 English, 15,000 Scots, 13,200 Scots-Irish, 5,200 Germans, and 3,900 Irish Catholics migrated to the Thirteen Colonies.[27] According to Butler (2000), up to half of English migrants in the 18th century may have been young, single men who were well-skilled, trained artisans, like the Huguenots.[28] Based on scholarly analysis, English was the largest single ancestry in all U.S. states at the time of the first census in 1790, ranging from a high of 82% in Massachusetts to a low of 35.3% in Pennsylvania, where Germans accounted for 33.3%.\nThe Census Bureau published preliminary estimates of the origins of the colonial American population by scholarly classification of the names of all White heads of families recorded in the 1790 census in a 1909 report entitled A Century of Population Growth.[29] These initial estimates were scrutinized and rejected following passage of the Immigration Act of 1924, when t\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Political leaders and social commentators sometimes cite these large numbers as evidence that the United States is facing an unprecedented crisis that threatens the economy and the cultural fabric of U.S. society. However, current levels of immigration, though at record highs in absolute numbers, are not out of line with those experienced for most of American history when considered relative to the total U.S. population. The United States has witnessed successive waves of mass immigration that were initially seen as crises but are now celebrated as major contributions to a \u201cnation of immigrants\u201d (Kennedy, 2008; Martin, 2010). In the coming years, immigration will be the primary source of labor force growth in an increasingly aging population.\nPlacing current and future immigrant trends and patterns into historical perspective is the objective of this chapter. In addition to setting the stage for the subsequent chapters of this report, a look backward also provides context for understanding the contentious debates over immigration. Each generation of Americans, from the founding of the republic to the present day, has wrestled with questions of who should be allowed to enter the country and to become a citizen. Americans, especially natives and long-\nsettled immigrants, have always been suspicious of the qualities of newcomers: their character, their skills, their loyalty, and their potential to assimilate to American values and institutions (Zolberg, 2006). At many times during U.S. history, laws and policies were enacted to restrict the entry and freedoms of different groups of newcomers. But the door was never completely closed, and peoples from almost every part of the world have continued to seek refuge and opportunity on American soil that they could not find in their home countries (Daniels, 1991; King, 2000; Reimers, 1992).\nThe growth of the U.S. population from less than 4 million in 1790 to about 320 million in 2015 is due in no small measure to immigration. Most Americans today are the descendants of immigrants who arrived after the founding of the nation in the late 18th century (Edmonston and Passel, 1994, p. 61; Gibson, 1992). Their immigrant ancestors may not have been welcomed because their language, religion, culture, or appearance was not considered sufficiently \u201cAmerican.\u201d Yet, with the passage of generations, the children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren of the successive waves of immigrants have become part of the American tapestry. This multigenerational process, which involves integration of different peoples, religions, and cultures, has diversified and broadened what it means to be \u201can American\u201d (Gleason, 1980).\nImmigrants and their descendants have also been accepted, even if not fully embraced, because of their determination and enterprise. Many immigrants are willing to undertake less desirable jobs than, and to settle in locations that are shunned by, native-born workers. The children of immigrants are often distinguished by their ambition and creativity (Hirschman, 2013), helping to invigorate American society and sustain this nation\u2019s world leadership in science and culture. In his 1958 book, A Nation of Immigrants, then-Senator John F. Kennedy claimed that the distinctive American culture of optimism and enterprise arises from our immigrant heritage.\nIn this brief survey, the panel addresses four major contemporary issues that have historical roots:\nTo understand the significance of these issues, the chapter begins with an overview of historical trends and patterns of immigration to the United\nStates. Three themes are emphasized (1) the volume of immigrant inflows and their changing origins; (2) the context of reception, often hostile but later accommodating; and (3) the successful integration of immigrants and their children.\nThe United States began collecting data on the numbers and origins of arrivals by ship in 1820. This statistical series, published in the annual Yearbook of Immigration of Statistics by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is widely considered to be the standard account of immigration to the United States, even though the series provides an incomplete record of immigration for much of American history. For example, overland entries from Canada and Mexico were not counted until the early 20th century. In recent decades, the DHS figures are not the number of new arrivals but of persons receiving lawful permanent resident (LPR) status, commonly called receiving a \u201cgreen card.\u201d More than 1 million persons receive LPR status each year, but the majority of these have already been in the United States, some for many years. In addition, many other new arrivals enter the United States on temporary visas to work, study, or accompany a family member who comes to work or study. In fact, LPRs and temporary students or workers are not entirely separate populations, since over half of new LPR visas each year are \u201cstatus adjustments\u201d received by persons who were already in the United States on another visa (or even without a visa). Despite these limitations, the DHS series is the most widely used source of data for measuring long-term flows of (legal) immigrants to the United States. Figure 2-1 shows the absolute number (in thousands) of arrivals/LPRs based on the DHS data series with labels for the major immigration eras identified by Philip Martin (2013) in his Population Reference Bureau publication. We note that the spike in the numbers of new immigrants from 1989 to 1991 does not represent a surge of new arrivals but rather the change in legal status for the 3 mil\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Each generation of Americans, from the founding of the republic to the present day, has wrestled with questions of who should be allowed to enter the country and to become a citizen. Americans, especially natives and long-\nsettled immigrants, have always been suspicious of the qualities of newcomers: their character, their skills, their loyalty, and their potential to assimilate to American values and institutions (Zolberg, 2006). At many times during U.S. history, laws and policies were enacted to restrict the entry and freedoms of different groups of newcomers. But the door was never completely closed, and peoples from almost every part of the world have continued to seek refuge and opportunity on American soil that they could not find in their home countries (Daniels, 1991; King, 2000; Reimers, 1992).\nThe growth of the U.S. population from less than 4 million in 1790 to about 320 million in 2015 is due in no small measure to immigration. Most Americans today are the descendants of immigrants who arrived after the founding of the nation in the late 18th century (Edmonston and Passel, 1994, p. 61; Gibson, 1992). Their immigrant ancestors may not have been welcomed because their language, religion, culture, or appearance was not considered sufficiently \u201cAmerican.\u201d Yet, with the passage of generations, the children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren of the successive waves of immigrants have become part of the American tapestry. This multigenerational process, which involves integration of different peoples, religions, and cultures, has diversified and broadened what it means to be \u201can American\u201d (Gleason, 1980).\nImmigrants and their descendants have also been accepted, even if not fully embraced, because of their determination and enterprise. Many immigrants are willing to undertake less desirable jobs than, and to settle in locations that are shunned by, native-born workers. The children of immigrants are often distinguished by their ambition and creativity (Hirschman, 2013), helping to invigorate American society and sustain this nation\u2019s world leadership in science and culture. In his 1958 book, A Nation of Immigrants, then-Senator John F. Kennedy claimed that the distinctive American culture of optimism and enterprise arises from our immigrant heritage.\nIn this brief survey, the panel addresses four major contemporary issues that have historical roots:\nTo understand the significance of these issues, the chapter begins with an overview of historical trends and patterns of immigration to the United\nStates. Three themes are emphasized (1) the volume of immigrant inflows and their changing origins; (2) the context of reception, often hostile but later accommodating; and (3) the successful integration of immigrants and their children.\nThe United States began collecting data on the numbers and origins of arrivals by ship in 1820. This statistical series, published in the annual Yearbook of Immigration of Statistics by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is widely considered to be the standard account of immigration to the United States, even though the series provides an incomplete record of immigration for much of American history. For example, overland entries from Canada and Mexico were not counted until the early 20th century. In recent decades, the DHS figures are not the number of new arrivals but of persons receiving lawful permanent resident (LPR) status, commonly called receiving a \u201cgreen card.\u201d More than 1 million persons receive LPR status each year, but the majority of these have already been in the United States, some for many years. In addition, many other new arrivals enter the United States on temporary visas to work, study, or accompany a family member who comes to work or study. In fact, LPRs and temporary students or workers are not entirely separate populations, since over half of new LPR visas each year are \u201cstatus adjustments\u201d received by persons who were already in the United States on another visa (or even without a visa). Despite these limitations, the DHS series is the most widely used source of data for measuring long-term flows of (legal) immigrants to the United States. Figure 2-1 shows the absolute number (in thousands) of arrivals/LPRs based on the DHS data series with labels for the major immigration eras identified by Philip Martin (2013) in his Population Reference Bureau publication. We note that the spike in the numbers of new immigrants from 1989 to 1991 does not represent a surge of new arrivals but rather the change in legal status for the 3 mil\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Together, the first generation (foreign-born) and second generation (U.S.-born children of the first generation) comprise almost one in four Americans (Pew Research Center, 2015a, p. 120). Political leaders and social commentators sometimes cite these large numbers as evidence that the United States is facing an unprecedented crisis that threatens the economy and the cultural fabric of U.S. society. However, current levels of immigration, though at record highs in absolute numbers, are not out of line with those experienced for most of American history when considered relative to the total U.S. population. The United States has witnessed successive waves of mass immigration that were initially seen as crises but are now celebrated as major contributions to a \u201cnation of immigrants\u201d (Kennedy, 2008; Martin, 2010).
