    "input_prompt": "Claim:\nDemocracy is a system where citizens have the power to choose their leaders.\n\nArticle Title:\nWhat is Democracy?\n\nGoogle Search Snippet:\nDemocracy is a means for the people to choose their leaders and to hold their leaders accountable for their policies and their conduct in office ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nI want to begin with an overview of what democracy is. We can think of democracy as a system of government with four key elements: A political system for choosing and replacing the government through free and fair elections. 2. The active participation of the people, as citizens, in politics and civic life. 3. Protection of the human rights of all citizens. 4. A rule of law, in which the laws and procedures apply equally to all citizens. I want to talk about each of these four elements of what democracy is. Then I will talk about the obligations and requirements of citizens in a democracy. Then I will conclude by talking about the obligations that we, the international community, have to the people of Iraq as you seek to build the first true democracy in the Arab world.\nDemocracy is a means for the people to choose their leaders and to hold their leaders accountable for their policies and their conduct in office. The people decide who will represent them in parliament, and who will head the government at the national and local levels. They do so by choosing between competing parties in regular, free and fair elections. Government is based on the consent of the governed. In a democracy, the people are sovereign\u2014they are the highest form of political authority. Power flows from the people to the leaders of government, who hold power only temporarily. Laws and policies require majority support in parliament, but the rights of minorities are protected in various ways.\nThe people are free to criticize their elected leaders and representatives, and to observe how they conduct the business of government. Elected representatives at the national and local levels should listen to the people and respond to their needs and suggestions. Elections have to occur at regular intervals, as prescribed by law. Those in power cannot extend their terms in office without asking for the consent of the people again in an election. For elections to be free and fair, they have to be administered by a neutral, fair, and professional body that treats all political parties and candidates equally. All parties and candidates must have the right to campaign freely, to present their proposals to the voters both directly and through the mass media. Voters must be able to vote in secret, free of intimidation and violence. Independent observers must be able to observe the voting and the vote counting to ensure that the process is free of corruption, intimidation, and fraud. There needs to be some impartial and independent tribunal to resolve any disputes about the election results. This is why it takes a lot of time to organize a good, democratic election. Any country can hold an election, but for an election to be free and fair requires a lot of organization, preparation, and training of political parties, electoral officials, and civil society organizations who monitor the process.\nThe key role of citizens in a democracy is to participate in public life. Citizens have an obligation to become informed about public issues, to watch carefully how their political leaders and representatives use their powers, and to express their own opinions and interests. Voting in elections is another important civic duty of all citizens. But to vote wisely, each citizen should listen to the views of the different parties and candidates, and then make his or her own decision on whom to support. Participation can also involve campaigning for a political party or candidate, standing as a candidate for political office, debating public issues, attending community meetings, petitioning the government, and even protesting. A vital form of participation comes through active membership in independent, non-governmental organizations, what we call \u201ccivil society.\u201d These organizations represent a variety of interests and beliefs: farmers, workers, doctors, teachers, business owners, religious believers, women, students, human rights activists. It is important that women participate fully both in politics and in civil society. This requires efforts by civil society organizations to educate women about their democratic rights and responsibilities, improve their political skills, represent their common interests, and involve them in political life. In a democracy, participation in civic groups should be voluntary. No one should be forced to join an organization against their will. Political parties are vital organizations in a democracy, and democracy is stronger when citizens become active members of political parties. However, no one should support a political party because he is pressured or threatened by others. In a democracy, citizens are free to choose which party to support. Democracy depends on citizen participation in all these ways. But participation must be peaceful, respectful of the law, and tolerant of the different views of other groups and individuals.\nIn a democracy, every citizen has certain basic rights that the state cannot take away from them. These rights are guaranteed under international law. You have the right to have your own beliefs, and to say and write what you think. No one can tell you what you must think, believe, and say or not say.\nThere is freedom of religion. Everyone is free to choose their own religion and to worship and practice their religion as they see fit. Every individual has the right to enjoy their own culture, along with other members of their group, even if their group is a minority.\nThere is freedom and pluralism in the mass media. You can choose between different sources of news and opinion to read in the newspapers, to hear on the radio, and to watch on television. You have the right to associate with other people, and to form and join organizations of your own choice, including trade unions. You are free to move about the country, and if you wish, to leave the country. You have the right to assemble freely, and to protest government actions. However, everyone has an obligation to exercise these rights\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The principles of democracy serve as the bedrock for ensuring that citizens' rights and freedoms are protected while promoting equality, justice, and fair governance. Here are 14 principles that serve as a foundation for a democratic society. Adapted from the Civil Liberties Union for Europe 1. Participation of Citizens Democracy empowers the people to have a voice in shaping the course of their government and future. In direct democracies, this means citizens vote directly on the laws they live under. In a representative democracy, it means they have the opportunity to choose their representatives and freely express their opinions and desires. In either case, citizen participation is the foundation that makes democracy strong. Participation isn't just about voting on election day, although that's its most notable form. Equally important are public debate, town meetings, and peaceful protests, among other activities. Each form of participation helps keep people informed and ready to vote. Citizens\u2019 groups and civil society organizations play a crucial role in ensuring people can participate in these activities and should be supported to maximize participation. 2. Equality All individuals must be treated equally in a democracy. This means they are not discriminated against based on their ethnicity, religion, gender, or sexual orientation. It also means that people have equal access to the free enjoyment of their rights, such as equal access to the voting booth. When it comes time to vote, it means that every vote counts the same \u2013 your vote is just as valuable and counts just as much as the wealthiest or most powerful person in your country. That is the most basic element of equality in a democracy. 3. Accountability People entrust powers to those they elect, and they expect them to use those powers to benefit their communities. Politicians are accountable to the people, must act in accordance with their will, and have a duty not to abuse their power for personal gain or to enrich friends. When authoritarian governments take control of newspapers and news channels, and when they hinder and intimidate civil society groups, it becomes all too easy to hide corruption and abuses of power out of the public eye. This makes it harder for people to hold the government accountable on election day. 4. Transparency To make informed choices at the ballot box, voters need to know the facts. They must understand whether their government is making good decisions, if its policies are effective, whether it is following the rules, or if it is stealing public money. Transparency means government actions are open to the public, including the results and outcomes. Government information should, with few exceptions, be accessible to everyone upon request. Journalists and the public should be able to ask their politicians questions, and groups that promote transparency should be free to operate. Transparency is for Government, Privacy is for People. 5. Political Tolerance Although majority rule is central to democracy, this does not mean that the minority is overlooked. In a true democracy, the rights of all citizens are equal and must be respected regardless of who is in power. Even if their views do not win on election day, they still have the right to continue sharing those views with other citizens and the government. This is healthy, if not essential. Democracy thrives on openness and richness of thought; by suppressing the rights and freedoms of the minority, the majority hinders itself. 6. Multi-Party System Citizens must have a choice on election day. This means that more than one political party can freely participate in an election campaign and be an option for voters. When opposition parties do win, power is transferred and public debate about how to lead the country continues. If there is only a single party, it is most likely a dictatorship, though some countries have managed to build democratic systems under a single party rule. 7. Control Over the Abuse of Power Democracy can only survive if everyone participates \u2014 citizens through their support on voting day and throughout the year, and politicians by following the rules and working to improve everyone's lives. Abuse of power occurs when a government acts as if it's above the law, when politicians believe different rules apply to them, when the government favors only certain parts of society at the expense of others, or when public funds are misused by corrupt leaders and their allies. We often see this in the world\u2019s \u201cdemocracies.\" There are ways to protect democracy from these abuses, but no method can guarantee complete security. For instance, spreading power across different branches of government helps keep them accountable. Protecting free and fair elections is also essential. This includes safeguarding independent media so citizens can access reliable information before voting and ensuring election laws are fair to maintain the integrity of the process. 8. Freedom of Economy In a democracy, individuals should be free to choose their own paths in life. As long as they follow the rules, it\u2019s not the government\u2019s place to dictate what they should study, what job they should take, or what they should produce. Economic freedom is essential for building strong communities and a thriving national economy. 9.

The principles of democracy serve as the bedrock for ensuring that citizens' rights and freedoms are protected while promoting equality, justice, and fair governance. Here are 14 principles that serve as a foundation for a democratic society. Adapted from the Civil Liberties Union for Europe 1. Participation of Citizens Democracy empowers the people to have a voice in shaping the course of their government and future. In direct democracies, this means citizens vote directly on the laws they live under. In a representative democracy, it means they have the opportunity to choose their representatives and freely express their opinions and desires. In either case, citizen participation is the foundation that makes democracy strong. Participation isn't just about voting on election day, although that's its most notable form. Equally important are public debate, town meetings, and peaceful protests, among other activities. Each form of participation helps keep people informed and ready to vote. Citizens\u2019 groups and civil society organizations play a crucial role in ensuring people can participate in these activities and should be supported to maximize participation. 2. Equality All individuals must be treated equally in a democracy. This means they are not discriminated against based on their ethnicity, religion, gender, or sexual orientation. It also means that people have equal access to the free enjoyment of their rights, such as equal access to the voting booth. When it comes time to vote, it means that every vote counts the same \u2013 your vote is just as valuable and counts just as much as the wealthiest or most powerful person in your country. That is the most basic element of equality in a democracy. 3. Accountability People entrust powers to those they elect, and they expect them to use those powers to benefit their communities. Politicians are accountable to the people, must act in accordance with their will, and have a duty not to abuse their power for personal gain or to enrich friends. When authoritarian governments take control of newspapers and news channels, and when they hinder and intimidate civil society groups, it becomes all too easy to hide corruption and abuses of power out of the public eye. This makes it harder for people to hold the government accountable on election day. 4. Transparency To make informed choices at the ballot box, voters need to know the facts. They must understand whether their government is making good decisions, if its policies are effective, whether it is following the rules, or if it is stealing public money. Transparency means government actions are open to the public, including the results and outcomes. Government information should, with few exceptions, be accessible to everyone upon request. Journalists and the public should be able to ask their politicians questions, and groups that promote transparency should be free to operate. Transparency is for Government, Privacy is for People. 5. Political Tolerance Although majority rule is central to democracy, this does not mean that the minority is overlooked. In a true democracy, the rights of all citizens are equal and must be respected regardless of who is in power. Even if their views do not win on election day, they still have the right to continue sharing those views with other citizens and the government. This is healthy, if not essential. Democracy thrives on openness and richness of thought; by suppressing the rights and freedoms of the minority, the majority hinders itself. 6. Multi-Party System Citizens must have a choice on election day. This means that more than one political party can freely participate in an election campaign and be an option for voters. When opposition parties do win, power is transferred and public debate about how to lead the country continues. If there is only a single party, it is most likely a dictatorship, though some countries have managed to build democratic systems under a single party rule. 7. Control Over the Abuse of Power Democracy can only survive if everyone participates \u2014 citizens through their support on voting day and throughout the year, and politicians by following the rules and working to improve everyone's lives.

Though the ... Athens to vote a particular citizen to be ostracised from the polis.\n\nFull Page Content:\nIn Athenian democracy, every citizen was required to participate or suffer punishment. In fact, men who did not appear at the assembly meeting were caught and marked with red paint as punishment. This practice stands in stark contrast to most modern democratic governments in which citizens can choose whether they wish to participate.\nNot everyone in Athens was considered a citizen. Only free adult men enjoyed the rights and responsibility of citizenship. Only about 20 percent of the population of Athens held citizenship. Women were not citizens and therefore could not vote or have a voice in the political process. Women were rarely permitted out in public and were even restricted as to where they could be within their own homes. Slaves and foreigners also were not citizens.\nNevertheless, the idea of democratic government is one of the most significant contributions of the ancient Greeks. The city-state of Athens had one of the largest democracies in terms of population.\nEarly in Athens' history (around 594 B.C.E.), a man named Solon enacted reforms that reduced the growing gap between the rich and the poor. Poor citizens gained the right to sit in the assembly and to vote.\nLater, Cleisthenes expanded the democracy by giving every citizen equal rights. He also created a legislative body whose members were picked randomly from the general population of citizens.\nTypically, the citizens of Athens would gather in the agora when there was an assembly meeting. The agora, present in every major Greek city-state, was a large open space in the middle of the city-state that contained a marketplace as well as government buildings. Citizens would mingle at the agora and discuss the issues of the day before gathering for the assembly meeting, where citizens could express their opinions and cast their votes.\nThe courts, too, were usually in the agora. The juries in court cases often had hundreds and sometimes thousands of members. Athenians wanted their juries to reflect the general population. There were no lawyers, and each citizen was expected to argue his own case.\nAll citizens were expected both to vote and to serve in the government if necessary. In Athens, the people governed, and the majority ruled. All citizens had equal rights and powers.\nIn a city-state as small as Athens, a pure democracy was possible. As states grew larger, the notion of electing representatives to make decisions for the public became more practical. But the idea that every citizen\u2019s a voice is important enough to be heard originated in ancient Athens.\nSource: Democracy Is Born Copyright \u00a92008-2021 ushistory.org, owned by the Independence Hall Association in Philadelphia, founded 1942.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The U.S. Department of State submits reports on all countries receiving assistance and all United Nations member states to the U.S. Congress in accordance with the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the Trade Act of 1974.\nAs mandated by Congress, every year since 1977, the State Department\u2019s dedicated public servants in U.S. missions abroad and in Washington scrupulously examine, track, and document the state of human rights in nearly 200 countries and territories around the world. In compiling these \u201cCountry Reports on Human Rights Practices,\u201d commonly known as the Human Rights Report (HRR), we have drawn from a variety of credible, fact-based sources, including reporting from government agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and media. The HRR helps connect U.S. diplomatic and foreign assistance efforts to the fundamental American value of protecting and promoting respect for human rights for all, while helping to inform the work of civil society, human rights defenders, scholars, multilateral institutions, and others.\nThe President\u2019s Summit for Democracy underscores the United States\u2019 commitment to advancing respect for human rights, and to the promotion of democracy as the most effective system of government to secure them. We are pleased the third Summit for Democracy took place this year under the Republic of Korea\u2019s leadership. Through the Summits for Democracy, the United States and other participating governments, along with partners from civil society, youth, and other stakeholders, seek to cement progress in human rights, foster democratic reforms, expand space for independent media, advance women\u2019s rights, combat corruption, and make technology work for democracies and their people, not misused by malign actors as a tool of repression.\nThe year covered by this HRR coincided with the 75th anniversary of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). In commemoration of the anniversary, the United States made several new commitments, including to renew investments around the world in democracy and human rights, to help protect human rights defenders online, and to advance racial and gender justice in the United States.\nIn the words of Eleanor Roosevelt, one of the authors of the UDHR, \u201cThe destiny of human rights is in the hands of all our citizens in all our communities.\u201d We hope that this Report proves a useful contribution to that shared global effort, by chronicling both sobering developments in specific countries, as well as evidence of progress.\nThe Kremlin\u2019s disregard and contempt for human rights are on full display in its war against Ukraine. Russian forces employ violence against civilians as a deliberate tool of warfare. The Report highlights documentation of human rights violations and abuses \u2013 some amounting to crimes against humanity \u2013 throughout the second year of Russia\u2019s brutal, full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Civilians, including Ukrainian children, have suffered egregious abuses by Russian forces and other Russian officials. Tens of thousands of Ukrainian children have been transferred within Russia-occupied parts of Ukraine and/or deported to Russia, in many cases taken from their parents or lawful guardians and forced to take Russian names and citizenship. Russia is cracking down on its own citizens, bringing spurious criminal charges against hundreds of Russians who have spoken against Putin\u2019s war of aggression.\nAcross Sudan, the Sudanese Armed Forces and Rapid Support Forces have unleashed horrific violence, death, and destruction, including mass killings, unjust detentions, rape, and other forms of gender-based violence. In December, I determined that members of both forces engaged in war crimes, and that members of the Rapid Support Forces and allied militia engaged in crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing. Elsewhere in Africa, Uganda\u2019s government took aim at the human rights of all Ugandans, enacting a broad, draconian anti-LGBTQI+ legislation, including the death penalty for \u201cserial offenders.\u201d\nThe conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza continues to raise deeply troubling concerns for human rights. Hamas\u2019 brutal terrorist attacks on October 7 killed around 1,200 people, took approximately 230 Israeli and foreign hostages, and included appalling abuses, including gender-based violence and sexual violence. As Israel exercises its right to self-defense, we have made clear that it must conduct military operations in accordance with international law and take every feasible precaution to protect civilians. We continue to urgently raise concerns surrounding the deaths of and injuries to tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, including women, children, persons with disabilities, and other vulnerable persons. We repeatedly have pressed concerns about Palestinian civilians\u2019 access to humanitarian assistance, displacement of the majority of the population of Gaza, and the unprecedented number of journalists killed. We have repeatedly condemned Hamas\u2019 abhorrent misuse of civilians and civilian infrastructure as human shields and its continued refusal to release all hostages. We also continue to condemn the record levels of violence in the West Bank, including attacks by violent extremist settlers against Palestinian civilians.\nThe Report illuminates the ongoing and brutal human rights abuses in Iran, where the regime\u2019s violent repression of its citizens occurs at home and even abroad, including through acts of transnational repression targeting the regime\u2019s perceived dissidents and critics.

The U.S. Department of State submits reports on all countries receiving assistance and all United Nations member states to the U.S. Congress in accordance with the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the Trade Act of 1974.\nAs mandated by Congress, every year since 1977, the State Department\u2019s dedicated public servants in U.S. missions abroad and in Washington scrupulously examine, track, and document the state of human rights in nearly 200 countries and territories around the world. In compiling these \u201cCountry Reports on Human Rights Practices,\u201d commonly known as the Human Rights Report (HRR), we have drawn from a variety of credible, fact-based sources, including reporting from government agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and media. The HRR helps connect U.S. diplomatic and foreign assistance efforts to the fundamental American value of protecting and promoting respect for human rights for all, while helping to inform the work of civil society, human rights defenders, scholars, multilateral institutions, and others.\nThe President\u2019s Summit for Democracy underscores the United States\u2019 commitment to advancing respect for human rights, and to the promotion of democracy as the most effective system of government to secure them. We are pleased the third Summit for Democracy took place this year under the Republic of Korea\u2019s leadership. Through the Summits for Democracy, the United States and other participating governments, along with partners from civil society, youth, and other stakeholders, seek to cement progress in human rights, foster democratic reforms, expand space for independent media, advance women\u2019s rights, combat corruption, and make technology work for democracies and their people, not misused by malign actors as a tool of repression.\nThe year covered by this HRR coincided with the 75th anniversary of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). In commemoration of the anniversary, the United States made several new commitments, including to renew investments around the world in democracy and human rights, to help protect human rights defenders online, and to advance racial and gender justice in the United States.\nIn the words of Eleanor Roosevelt, one of the authors of the UDHR, \u201cThe destiny of human rights is in the hands of all our citizens in all our communities.\u201d We hope that this Report proves a useful contribution to that shared global effort, by chronicling both sobering developments in specific countries, as well as evidence of progress.\nThe Kremlin\u2019s disregard and contempt for human rights are on full display in its war against Ukraine. Russian forces employ violence against civilians as a deliberate tool of warfare. The Report highlights documentation of human rights violations and abuses \u2013 some amounting to crimes against humanity \u2013 throughout the second year of Russia\u2019s brutal, full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Civilians, including Ukrainian children, have suffered egregious abuses by Russian forces and other Russian officials. Tens of thousands of Ukrainian children have been transferred within Russia-occupied parts of Ukraine and/or deported to Russia, in many cases taken from their parents or lawful guardians and forced to take Russian names and citizenship. Russia is cracking down on its own citizens, bringing spurious criminal charges against hundreds of Russians who have spoken against Putin\u2019s war of aggression.\nAcross Sudan, the Sudanese Armed Forces and Rapid Support Forces have unleashed horrific violence, death, and destruction, including mass killings, unjust detentions, rape, and other forms of gender-based violence. In December, I determined that members of both forces engaged in war crimes, and that members of the Rapid Support Forces and allied militia engaged in crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing. Elsewhere in Africa, Uganda\u2019s government took aim at the human rights of all Ugandans, enacting a broad, draconian anti-LGBTQI+ legislation, including the death penalty for \u201cserial offenders.\u201d\nThe conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza continues to raise deeply troubling concerns for human rights. Hamas\u2019 brutal terrorist attacks on October 7 killed around 1,200 people, took approximately 230 Israeli and foreign hostages, and included appalling abuses, including gender-based violence and sexual violence. As Israel exercises its right to self-defense, we have made clear that it must conduct military operations in accordance with international law and take every feasible precaution to protect civilians. We continue to urgently raise concerns surrounding the deaths of and injuries to tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, including women, children, persons with disabilities, and other vulnerable persons. We repeatedly have pressed concerns about Palestinian civilians\u2019 access to humanitarian assistance, displacement of the majority of the population of Gaza, and the unprecedented number of journalists killed. We have repeatedly condemned Hamas\u2019 abhorrent misuse of civilians and civilian infrastructure as human shields and its continued refusal to release all hostages. We also continue to condemn the record levels of violence in the West Bank, including attacks by violent extremist settlers against Palestinian civilians.\nThe Report illuminates the ongoing and brutal human rights abuses in Iran, where the regime\u2019s violent repression of its citizens occurs at home and even abroad, including through acts of transnational repression targeting the regime\u2019s perceived dissidents and critics.

By continuing to use the site, you agree to our privacy policy.\nThe annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices \u2013 the Human Rights Report \u2013 cover internationally recognized individual, civil, political, and worker rights, as set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international agreements. The U.S. Department of State submits reports on all countries receiving assistance and all United Nations member states to the U.S. Congress in accordance with the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the Trade Act of 1974.\nAs mandated by Congress, every year since 1977, the State Department\u2019s dedicated public servants in U.S. missions abroad and in Washington scrupulously examine, track, and document the state of human rights in nearly 200 countries and territories around the world. In compiling these \u201cCountry Reports on Human Rights Practices,\u201d commonly known as the Human Rights Report (HRR), we have drawn from a variety of credible, fact-based sources, including reporting from government agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and media. The HRR helps connect U.S. diplomatic and foreign assistance efforts to the fundamental American value of protecting and promoting respect for human rights for all, while helping to inform the work of civil society, human rights defenders, scholars, multilateral institutions, and others.\nThe President\u2019s Summit for Democracy underscores the United States\u2019 commitment to advancing respect for human rights, and to the promotion of democracy as the most effective system of government to secure them. We are pleased the third Summit for Democracy took place this year under the Republic of Korea\u2019s leadership. Through the Summits for Democracy, the United States and other participating governments, along with partners from civil society, youth, and other stakeholders, seek to cement progress in human rights, foster democratic reforms, expand space for independent media, advance women\u2019s rights, combat corruption, and make technology work for democracies and their people, not misused by malign actors as a tool of repression.\nThe year covered by this HRR coincided with the 75th anniversary of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). In commemoration of the anniversary, the United States made several new commitments, including to renew investments around the world in democracy and human rights, to help protect human rights defenders online, and to advance racial and gender justice in the United States.\nIn the words of Eleanor Roosevelt, one of the authors of the UDHR, \u201cThe destiny of human rights is in the hands of all our citizens in all our communities.\u201d We hope that this Report proves a useful contribution to that shared global effort, by chronicling both sobering developments in specific countries, as well as evidence of progress.\nThe Kremlin\u2019s disregard and contempt for human rights are on full display in its war against Ukraine. Russian forces employ violence against civilians as a deliberate tool of warfare. The Report highlights documentation of human rights violations and abuses \u2013 some amounting to crimes against humanity \u2013 throughout the second year of Russia\u2019s brutal, full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Civilians, including Ukrainian children, have suffered egregious abuses by Russian forces and other Russian officials. Tens of thousands of Ukrainian children have been transferred within Russia-occupied parts of Ukraine and/or deported to Russia, in many cases taken from their parents or lawful guardians and forced to take Russian names and citizenship. Russia is cracking down on its own citizens, bringing spurious criminal charges against hundreds of Russians who have spoken against Putin\u2019s war of aggression.\nAcross Sudan, the Sudanese Armed Forces and Rapid Support Forces have unleashed horrific violence, death, and destruction, including mass killings, unjust detentions, rape, and other forms of gender-based violence. In December, I determined that members of both forces engaged in war crimes, and that members of the Rapid Support Forces and allied militia engaged in crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing. Elsewhere in Africa, Uganda\u2019s government took aim at the human rights of all Ugandans, enacting a broad, draconian anti-LGBTQI+ legislation, including the death penalty for \u201cserial offenders.\u201d\nThe conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza continues to raise deeply troubling concerns for human rights. Hamas\u2019 brutal terrorist attacks on October 7 killed around 1,200 people, took approximately 230 Israeli and foreign hostages, and included appalling abuses, including gender-based violence and sexual violence. As Israel exercises its right to self-defense, we have made clear that it must conduct military operations in accordance with international law and take every feasible precaution to protect civilians. We continue to urgently raise concerns surrounding the deaths of and injuries to tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, including women, children, persons with disabilities, and other vulnerable persons. We repeatedly have pressed concerns about Palestinian civilians\u2019 access to humanitarian assistance, displacement of the majority of the population of Gaza, and the unprecedented number of journalists killed. We have repeatedly condemned Hamas\u2019 abhorrent misuse of civilians and civilian infrastructure as human shields and its continued refusal to release all hostages. We also continue to condemn the record levels of violence in the West Bank, including attacks by violent extremist settlers against Palestinian civilians.\nThe Report illuminates the ongoing and brutal human rights abuses in Iran, where the regime\u2019s violent repression of its citizens occurs at home and even abroad, including through acts of transnational repression targeting the regime\u2019s perceived dissidents and critics.

The ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAthenian democracy developed around the 6th century BC in the Greek city-state (known as a polis) of Athens, comprising the city of Athens and the surrounding territory of Attica, and focusing on supporting liberty, equality, and security.[1] Although Athens is the most familiar of the democratic city-states in ancient Greece, it was not the only one, nor was it the first; multiple other city-states adopted similar democratic constitutions before Athens.[2][3] By the late 4th century BC, as many as half of the over one thousand existing Greek cities might have been democracies.[4] Athens practiced a political system of legislation and executive bills. Participation was open to adult, free male citizens (i.e., not a metic, woman or slave). Adult male citizens probably constituted no more than 30 percent of the total adult population.[5]\nSolon (in 594 BC), Cleisthenes (in 508\u201307 BC), and Ephialtes (in 462 BC) contributed to the development of Athenian democracy.[6] Cleisthenes broke up the unlimited power of the nobility by organizing citizens into ten groups based on where they lived, rather than on their wealth.[6] The longest-lasting democratic leader was Pericles. After his death, Athenian democracy was twice briefly interrupted by oligarchic revolutions in 411 and 404 BC, towards the end of the Peloponnesian War. It was modified somewhat after it was restored under Eucleides; the most detailed accounts of the system are of this fourth-century modification, rather than the Periclean system. Democracy was suppressed by the Macedonians in 322 BC. The Athenian institutions were later revived, but how close they were to the original forms of democracy is debated.\nThe word \"democracy\" (Greek: d\u0113mokratia, \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1) combines the elements d\u00eamos (\u03b4\u1fc6\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, traditionally interpreted \"people\" or \"towns\"[7]) and kr\u00e1tos (\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, which means \"force\" or \"power\"), and thus means literally \"people power\". In the words \"monarchy\" and \"oligarchy\", the second element comes from arch\u0113 (\u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u03ae), meaning \"beginning (that which comes first)\", and hence also \"first place or power\", \"sovereignty\". One might expect, by analogy, that the term \"demarchy\" would have been adopted for the new form of government introduced by Athenian democrats. However, the word \"demarchy\" (\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03af\u03b1) had already been taken and meant \"mayoralty\", the office or rank of a high municipal magistrate. (In present-day use, the term \"demarchy\" has acquired a new meaning.)\nIt is unknown whether the word \"democracy\" was in existence when systems that came to be called democratic were first instituted. The first conceptual articulation of the term is generally accepted to be c. 470 The Suppliants (l. 604) with the line sung by the Chorus: d\u0113mou kratousa cheir (\u03b4\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b1 \u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1). This approximately translates as the \"people's hand of power\", and in the context of the play it acts as a representation of the popular requirement that the king needed to get approval from the Demos in a public assembly before taking any large decision (in this case of allowing the suppliant daughters of Danaos to take refuge in the city-state of Argos), i.e. that authority as implemented by the people in the Assembly has veto power over a king. The word is then attested in the works of Herodotus (Histories 6.43.3) in both a verbal and nominal sense with the terms d\u0113mokrateomai (\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03ad\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9) meaning \"I participate in a democracy\" and d\u0113mokratia (\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1) meaning \"democracy.\" The earlier word used for the concept is isonomia, which is indicated also in Herodotus's discussion.[8] Around 460 BC an individual is known with the name of Democrates,[9] a name possibly coined as a gesture of democratic loyalty; the name can also be found in Aeolian Temnos.[10]\nAthens was not the only polis in Ancient Greece that instituted a democratic resume. Aristotle points out other cities that adopted democratic governments. Most general accounts of the rise of democratic institutions refer mainly to Athens, since this Greek city-state's system provides a fuller historical record, including having the only complete extant \"constitution\" as compiled by Aristotle and his students in the 4th century BCE \u2013 part of a collection called Constitutions (Politeiai) .[11]\nBefore the first attempt at democratic government, Athens was ruled by a series of archons,[12] or magistrates, and the council of the Areopagus, made up of ex-archons. The members of these institutions were generally aristocrats. In 621 BC, Draco replaced the prevailing system of oral law by a written code to be enforced only by a court of law.[13][14] While the laws, later come to be known as the Draconian Constitution, were largely harsh and restrictive, with nearly all of them later being repealed, the written legal code was one of the first of its kind and considered to be one of the earliest developments of Athenian democracy.[15] In 594 BC, Solon was appointed premier archon and began issuing economic and constitutional reforms in an attempt to alleviate some of the conflict that was beginning to arise from the inequities that permeated throughout Athenian society. His reforms ultimately redefined citizenship in a way that gave each free resident of Attica a political function: Athenian citizens had the right to participate in assembly meetings. Solon sought to break away at the strong influence noble families had on the government by broadening the government's structure to include a wider range of property classes rather than just the aristocracy. His constitutional reforms included establishing four property classes: the pentakosiomedimnoi, the hippeis, the zeugitai, and the thetes.[16] The classifications were based on how many medimnoi a man's estate made per year with the pentakosiomedimnoi making at least 500 medimnoi, the hippeis making 300\u2013500 medimnoi, the zeugitai making 200\u2013300 medimnoi, and the thetes making under 200 medimnoi.[16] By granting the formerly aristocratic role to every free citizen of Athens \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Participation was open to adult, free male citizens (i.e., not a metic, woman or slave). Adult male citizens probably constituted no more than 30 percent of the total adult population.[5]\nSolon (in 594 BC), Cleisthenes (in 508\u201307 BC), and Ephialtes (in 462 BC) contributed to the development of Athenian democracy.[6] Cleisthenes broke up the unlimited power of the nobility by organizing citizens into ten groups based on where they lived, rather than on their wealth.[6] The longest-lasting democratic leader was Pericles. After his death, Athenian democracy was twice briefly interrupted by oligarchic revolutions in 411 and 404 BC, towards the end of the Peloponnesian War. It was modified somewhat after it was restored under Eucleides; the most detailed accounts of the system are of this fourth-century modification, rather than the Periclean system. Democracy was suppressed by the Macedonians in 322 BC. The Athenian institutions were later revived, but how close they were to the original forms of democracy is debated.\nThe word \"democracy\" (Greek: d\u0113mokratia, \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1) combines the elements d\u00eamos (\u03b4\u1fc6\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, traditionally interpreted \"people\" or \"towns\"[7]) and kr\u00e1tos (\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, which means \"force\" or \"power\"), and thus means literally \"people power\".
