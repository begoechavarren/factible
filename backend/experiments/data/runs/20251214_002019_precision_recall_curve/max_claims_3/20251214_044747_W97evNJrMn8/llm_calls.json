    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nthe Labour party has won this general election and that's it 14 years of conservative rule has this morning come to a rather brutal end after a relatively short but terribly bruising campaign the conservatives have been reduced to their lowest seat share ever with them dropping below the 156 seats that they won in the 1906 general election on the other side of things though laor have achieved almost the highest seat share in their history getting very close to the huge 400 18 seats that they won in the 1997 general election it's not only labor who've had a good night though the liberal Democrats have also had a very good night with their seat share ticking up to a huge 71 seats the highest seat share ever and up from only 11 in 2019 this is in fact even higher than their seat share in 2010 when they agreed to a formal Coalition with the conservative party similarly it seems that reform UK have had a pretty good night too they've gone from no seats to a pretty respectable four seats even more impressively it seems they've achieved an even more respectable 14.3% of the vote the greens didn't have a terrible night either with them not only holding on to Brighton Pavilion but also gaining Bristol Central waveny Valley and North herfordshire the only other party that had a pretty bad night was the SNP who were damaged by their ongoing scandals and their very recent change of leader despite their electoral dominance in Scotland over the last decade or so last night they received their lowest seat share since 2010 winning only nine seats this is a significant decline since 2019 when they won 48 out of the 56 available in Scotland obviously this will raise a couple of key questions the first is whether this is the beginning of the end of S&P dominance in Scotland and secondly is what such a terrible result will mean for the cause of Scottish independence so anyway these are the headline results from the election but let's dive a little deeper and have a look at what [Music] happened before we start if you haven't already please consider subscribing and ringing the bell to stay in the loop and be notified when we release new videos now the key event from last night occurred at 10 p.m. when we got our first indication of what was to come in the release of the exit Pole now the most shocking thing to note in the exit poll here was the number of expected reform seats the exit pole predicted that reform would get 13 seats significantly higher than most of the MRP polls in the run up to the election however there were some wobbles through the night with some polls suggesting that the exit pole had overestimated the number of seats the more observant of you will notice that it turns out that the exit pole had indeed overestimated and in the end reform achieved only four seats the other shocking find from the exit pole was the number of predicted Tory seats prior to election day many of the MRP polls were predicting below 100 Tory seats while the exit poll predicted icted that the Tories were going to win 131 seats What followed was deeply chaotic and something that made writing this video through the night even more difficult as the results started coming in it appeared that the exit pole was slightly wrong although the BBC and ITV couldn't quite agree in what direction in the we hours of Friday morning the BBC updated their prediction with them suggesting that the conservatives were going to win more seats while ITV updated theirs and predicted that they would in fact win fewer as things stand it appears that the Tories have won slightly fewer than originally predicted but not significantly anyway overall results aside the night was also particularly interesting when it came to individuals there were two properly shocking and unexpected results the first was Jonathan Ashworth unexpectedly losing his seat to an independent candidate Ashworth has previously been the shadow Health secretary and up until today was the shadow pay Master General it appears that the loss of his seat has been a result of labor stance on Gaza something that could cause problems from the incoming labor government more generally the second unexpected result was Jeremy Corbin's election in Islington North having been deselected as a labor MP Corbin opted to stand in his constituency as an independent he did however make the decision to stand rather late in the election cycle something that led to a decent proportion of journalists and pundits to believe that he was going to lose the constituency to the new labor candidate this wasn't the case though and Corbin secured himself a pretty decent majority so now that we've gone through exactly what happened through the night it's worth going through what this all means for the main parties now the most interesting party to discuss right now are the conservatives who as we've just discussed lost some pretty major figures through the night at the time of writing sunak has not yet announced his resignation as conservative leader although he is expected to either this morning or in the coming days and weeks this will naturally Kickstart a leadership election the question now is who would take over while it's a little too soon to tell there are some candidates that were in a particularly strong position right now KY Bok is in the strongest position she's got a rather strong following among right-wing Tories both in Parliament and among the membership what really bolsters this position is the fact that one of her key Rivals for the leadership Penny Morant lost her seat last night is worth mentioning though that there has been an issue in bok's constituency with postal votes and if this is challenging the courts it could cause problems for her candidacy in the Tory leadership election anyway someone else that there's some chatter about in terms of taking over the Tory leadership is Nigel farage and his potential defection from reform UK in order to lead the Tories after all he now has a seat in the House of Commons and there are some relatively senior members of the conservative party who have gone on the record as saying that they would like farage to join their party only the next few weeks will show exactly what happens here but if you do want to stay informed on this make sure you subscribe to the channel anyway what happens next for labor is quite simple the new prime minister K sta will meet the king and agree to form a government in his name he'll take office at Downing Street assemble his first cabinet and could even represent his party in a pmq session before the imminent summer recess they will soon begin implementing their policy platform as outlined in their Manifesto whether they're successful at implementing this is not yet known though and something we'll need to keep an eye on through the next few years of lab government regardless this is clearly a Monumental election for labor and the UK and when these kinds of Elections happen people tend to like to save newspapers and magazines with the headlines for posterity the

The leadership race commenced on 24 July and concluded on 31 October.[2] On 2 November, Kemi Badenoch was announced as the winner of the members' ballot, becoming the first black leader of any major UK political party, the fourth female Conservative leader and the second consecutive Conservative leader to be non-White.\nSix candidates stood for the leadership: Kemi Badenoch, James Cleverly, Robert Jenrick, Priti Patel, Mel Stride and Tom Tugendhat. Four were eliminated in a series of votes, until two remained to stand in the final ballot, which Conservative Party members voted in. On 4 September, Patel was eliminated in the first round of voting, with Jenrick outperforming expectations by coming first. On 10 September, Stride was eliminated in the second round and went on to endorse Cleverly.\nFollowing a strong performance at the Conservative Party Conference, Cleverly emerged as a frontrunner by coming first in the third round of voting, whilst Tugendhat was eliminated. Despite this, Cleverly was unexpectedly eliminated in a close fourth round of voting, leaving Badenoch and Jenrick to go head-to-head in a members' vote.\nBadenoch won the head-to-head and was elected Conservative leader on 2 November 2024, becoming the first black Briton to lead a major party. Stride, Patel, Jenrick and later Cleverly would all be appointed to her shadow cabinet.\nOn 7 July 2022, Boris Johnson resigned as Conservative leader and Prime Minister after dozens of ministers resigned from his government following a slew of scandals and controversies, including Partygate, that marred the final few months of his premiership, culminating in the Chris Pincher scandal.[3] A leadership election was triggered to replace him, in which Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss were the final two candidates to be put forward to party members after a series of MPs' ballots. Truss won the contest, beating Sunak in the members' vote 57% to 43%.[4] She assumed leadership of the party on 5 September 2022, and became Prime Minister the following day.[5]\nTruss's premiership would turn out to be the shortest of any Prime Minister in history, lasting just 49 days. Truss's tenure oversaw the death and state funeral of Elizabeth II, which caused government business to be suspended during the 10-day national mourning period from 8\u201319 September. On 23 September 2022, in response to the cost-of-living crisis, Truss's Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng announced a 'mini-budget', which introduced large-scale tax cuts and borrowing. It caused the value of pound sterling to crash, sliding to an all-time low against the US dollar. The mini-budget was widely criticised and its policies were gradually reversed over the following three weeks. The Conservatives' opinion poll ratings also began to fall sharply in the weeks following the announcement, dipping to around 20% as they trailed Labour by over 30% in some polls.\nTruss dismissed Kwarteng without explanation on 14 October 2022 and replaced him with Jeremy Hunt. By 17 October, pressure was beginning to mount on Truss's premiership and five Conservative MPs were calling for her resignation. On 19 October, Home Secretary Suella Braverman resigned after admitting to having used her personal email address to send a Cabinet document and her resignation letter was highly critical of Truss's government. Later that evening, a parliamentary vote on a debate to ban fracking \u2014 which was opposed by the government \u2014 descended into chaos over confusion whether it was being treated as a confidence vote in the government, compounded by speculation that the chief whip and deputy chief whip had resigned, and by allegations, later refuted, that some Conservative MPs had been manhandled in the division lobby. On 20 October, the following day, Truss announced she would resign as Prime Minister and Conservative leader shortly, triggering a second leadership election to find her replacement.[6]\nThe timetable for the October 2022 leadership election was much shorter than the July one. An expedited process was set out; candidates were required to obtain 100 nominations from fellow Conservative MPs before 2 pm on 24 October, and an MPs' ballot followed by an online members' ballot was to be held shortly thereafter if more than one candidate received more than 100 nominations. Only two candidates announced their intention to stand: Sunak and Penny Mordaunt. There was intensive speculation that Johnson would initiate a bid for a return to the top post; at one point he was expected to stand and even received 62 nominations from MPs, but he subsequently declined to enter the race.\nAs only Sunak met the required threshold among MPs, receiving 197 nominations to Mordaunt's 27, Mordaunt withdrew from the leadership race two minutes before nominations closed and Sunak was left the only candidate remaining, enabling him to win the contest and become Conservative leader without an MPs' ballot or members' vote. Sunak became Prime Minister the next day, on 25 October.[7][8]\nIn his first speech as Prime Minister, Sunak said that Truss \"was not wrong\" to want to improve growth and that he \"admired her restlessness to create change\", but admitted that \"some mistakes were made\", and that he was elected prime minister in part to fix them. He promised to \"place economic stability and confidence at the heart of this government's agenda\". In an almost immediate reversal of Truss's policy, Sunak reinstated the ban on fracking on 26 October 2022 as outlined in the 2019 Conservative manifesto.\nSunak was faced with the task of rebuilding the Conservatives' reputation which had been significantly damaged by the controversies and scandals of the previous year and the Truss ministry.

The leadership race commenced on 24 July and concluded on 31 October.[2] On 2 November, Kemi Badenoch was announced as the winner of the members' ballot, becoming the first black leader of any major UK political party, the fourth female Conservative leader and the second consecutive Conservative leader to be non-White.\nSix candidates stood for the leadership: Kemi Badenoch, James Cleverly, Robert Jenrick, Priti Patel, Mel Stride and Tom Tugendhat. Four were eliminated in a series of votes, until two remained to stand in the final ballot, which Conservative Party members voted in. On 4 September, Patel was eliminated in the first round of voting, with Jenrick outperforming expectations by coming first. On 10 September, Stride was eliminated in the second round and went on to endorse Cleverly.\nFollowing a strong performance at the Conservative Party Conference, Cleverly emerged as a frontrunner by coming first in the third round of voting, whilst Tugendhat was eliminated. Despite this, Cleverly was unexpectedly eliminated in a close fourth round of voting, leaving Badenoch and Jenrick to go head-to-head in a members' vote.\nBadenoch won the head-to-head and was elected Conservative leader on 2 November 2024, becoming the first black Briton to lead a major party. Stride, Patel, Jenrick and later Cleverly would all be appointed to her shadow cabinet.\nOn 7 July 2022, Boris Johnson resigned as Conservative leader and Prime Minister after dozens of ministers resigned from his government following a slew of scandals and controversies, including Partygate, that marred the final few months of his premiership, culminating in the Chris Pincher scandal.[3] A leadership election was triggered to replace him, in which Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss were the final two candidates to be put forward to party members after a series of MPs' ballots. Truss won the contest, beating Sunak in the members' vote 57% to 43%.[4] She assumed leadership of the party on 5 September 2022, and became Prime Minister the following day.[5]\nTruss's premiership would turn out to be the shortest of any Prime Minister in history, lasting just 49 days. Truss's tenure oversaw the death and state funeral of Elizabeth II, which caused government business to be suspended during the 10-day national mourning period from 8\u201319 September. On 23 September 2022, in response to the cost-of-living crisis, Truss's Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng announced a 'mini-budget', which introduced large-scale tax cuts and borrowing. It caused the value of pound sterling to crash, sliding to an all-time low against the US dollar. The mini-budget was widely criticised and its policies were gradually reversed over the following three weeks. The Conservatives' opinion poll ratings also began to fall sharply in the weeks following the announcement, dipping to around 20% as they trailed Labour by over 30% in some polls.\nTruss dismissed Kwarteng without explanation on 14 October 2022 and replaced him with Jeremy Hunt. By 17 October, pressure was beginning to mount on Truss's premiership and five Conservative MPs were calling for her resignation. On 19 October, Home Secretary Suella Braverman resigned after admitting to having used her personal email address to send a Cabinet document and her resignation letter was highly critical of Truss's government. Later that evening, a parliamentary vote on a debate to ban fracking \u2014 which was opposed by the government \u2014 descended into chaos over confusion whether it was being treated as a confidence vote in the government, compounded by speculation that the chief whip and deputy chief whip had resigned, and by allegations, later refuted, that some Conservative MPs had been manhandled in the division lobby. On 20 October, the following day, Truss announced she would resign as Prime Minister and Conservative leader shortly, triggering a second leadership election to find her replacement.[6]\nThe timetable for the October 2022 leadership election was much shorter than the July one. An expedited process was set out; candidates were required to obtain 100 nominations from fellow Conservative MPs before 2 pm on 24 October, and an MPs' ballot followed by an online members' ballot was to be held shortly thereafter if more than one candidate received more than 100 nominations. Only two candidates announced their intention to stand: Sunak and Penny Mordaunt. There was intensive speculation that Johnson would initiate a bid for a return to the top post; at one point he was expected to stand and even received 62 nominations from MPs, but he subsequently declined to enter the race.\nAs only Sunak met the required threshold among MPs, receiving 197 nominations to Mordaunt's 27, Mordaunt withdrew from the leadership race two minutes before nominations closed and Sunak was left the only candidate remaining, enabling him to win the contest and become Conservative leader without an MPs' ballot or members' vote. Sunak became Prime Minister the next day, on 25 October.[7][8]\nIn his first speech as Prime Minister, Sunak said that Truss \"was not wrong\" to want to improve growth and that he \"admired her restlessness to create change\", but admitted that \"some mistakes were made\", and that he was elected prime minister in part to fix them. He promised to \"place economic stability and confidence at the heart of this government's agenda\". In an almost immediate reversal of Truss's policy, Sunak reinstated the ban on fracking on 26 October 2022 as outlined in the 2019 Conservative manifesto.\nSunak was faced with the task of rebuilding the Conservatives' reputation which had been significantly damaged by the controversies and scandals of the previous year and the Truss ministry.

It sits on the centre-right[24] to right-wing[31] of the left\u2013right political spectrum. Following its defeat by Labour at the 2024 general election it is currently the second-largest party by the number of votes cast and number of seats in the House of Commons; as such it has the formal parliamentary role of His Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition. It encompasses various ideological factions including one-nation conservatives, Thatcherites and traditionalist conservatives. There have been 20 Conservative prime ministers.\nThe Conservative Party was founded in 1834 from the Tory Party and was one of two dominant political parties in the 19th century, along with the Liberal Party. Under Benjamin Disraeli it played a preeminent role in politics at the height of the British Empire. In 1912 the Liberal Unionist Party merged with the party to form the Conservative and Unionist Party. Its rivalry with the Labour Party has shaped modern British politics for the last century. David Cameron sought to modernise the party after his election as leader in 2005, and the party governed from 2010 to 2024 under five prime ministers, latterly Rishi Sunak.\nThe party has generally adopted liberal economic policies favouring free markets since the 1980s, although historically it advocated protectionism. The party is British unionist, opposing a united Ireland as well as English, Northern Irish, Scottish and Welsh independence, and has been critical of devolution. Historically the party supported the continuance and maintenance of the British Empire. The party has taken various approaches towards the European Union (EU), with Eurosceptic and, to a decreasing extent, pro-European factions within it. Historically the party took a socially conservative approach.[32][33] In defence policy it supports an independent nuclear weapons programme and commitment to NATO membership.\nFor much of modern British political history the United Kingdom exhibited a wide urban\u2013rural political divide;[34] the party's voting and financial support base has historically consisted primarily of homeowners, business-owners, farmers, real-estate-developers and middle-class voters, especially in rural and suburban areas of England.[35][36][37][38][39] Since the EU membership referendum in 2016 the Conservatives have targeted working-class voters from traditional Labour strongholds.[40][41][42][43] The party's domination of British politics throughout the 20th century made it one of the most electorally successful political parties in history.[44][45][46][47]\nSome writers trace the party's origins to the Tory Party, which it soon replaced. Other historians point to a faction, rooted in the 18th-century Whig Party, that coalesced around William Pitt the Younger in the 1780s. They were known as \"Independent Whigs\", \"Friends of Mr Pitt\" or \"Pittites\", and never used terms such as \"Tory\" or \"Conservative\". From about 1812 the name \"Tory\" was commonly used for a new party that, according to the historian Robert Blake, \"are the ancestors of Conservatism\". Blake adds that Pitt's successors after 1812 \"were not in any sense standard-bearers of 'true Toryism'\".[48]\nTory was an insult that entered English politics during the Exclusion Bill crisis of 1678\u20131681, which derived from the Middle Irish word t\u00f3raidhe (modern Irish: t\u00f3ra\u00ed) meaning outlaw or robber, which in turn derived from the Irish word t\u00f3ir, meaning pursuit, since outlaws were \"pursued men\".[49][50]\nThe term \"Conservative\" was suggested as a title for the party in an article by J. Wilson Croker published in the Quarterly Review in 1830.[51] The name immediately caught on and was formally adopted under the aegis of Robert Peel around 1834. Peel is acknowledged as the founder of the Conservative Party, which he created with the announcement of the Tamworth Manifesto. The term \"Conservative Party\" rather than Tory was the dominant usage by 1845.[52][53]\nThe widening of the electoral franchise in the 19th century forced the Conservative Party to popularise its approach under Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby, and Benjamin Disraeli, who carried through their own expansion of the franchise with the Reform Act 1867. The party was initially opposed to further expansion of the electorate but eventually allowed passage of William Ewart Gladstone's Representation of the People Act 1884. In 1886 the party formed an alliance with Spencer Cavendish's and Joseph Chamberlain's new Liberal Unionist Party and, under the statesmen Robert Gascoyne-Cecil and Arthur Balfour, held power for all but three of the following twenty years before suffering a heavy defeat in 1906, when it split over the issue of free trade.\nYoung Winston Churchill denounced Chamberlain's attack on free trade, and helped to organise the opposition inside the Unionist/Conservative Party. Nevertheless, Balfour, as party leader, introduced protectionist legislation.[54] Churchill crossed the floor and formally joined the Liberal Party (he rejoined the Conservatives in 1925). In December, Balfour lost control of his party, as the defections multiplied. He was replaced by Liberal Prime Minister Henry Campbell-Bannerman who called an election in January 1906, which produced a massive Liberal victory. Liberal Prime Minister H. H. Asquith enacted a great deal of reform legislation, but the Unionists worked hard at grassroots organizing. Two general elections were held in 1910, in January and in December. The two main parties were now almost dead equal in seats, but the Liberals kept control with a coalition with the Irish Parliamentary Party.[55][56]\nIn 1912 the Liberal Unionists merged with the Conservative Party.
