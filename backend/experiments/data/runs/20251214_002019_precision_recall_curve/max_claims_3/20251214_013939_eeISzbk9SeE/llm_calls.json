Although adverse health impacts from extreme events declined over the past few decades, climate change and more people moving into harm\u2019s way could alter this trend. Long-term changes to Earth\u2019s energy balance are increasing the frequency and intensity of many extreme events and the probability of compound events, with trends projected to accelerate under certain greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. While most of these events cannot be completely avoided, many of the health risks could be prevented through building climate-resilient health systems with improved risk reduction, preparation, response, and recovery. Conducting vulnerability and adaptation assessments and developing health system adaptation plans can identify priority actions to effectively reduce risks, such as disaster risk management and more resilient infrastructure. The risks are urgent, so action is needed now.\nKeywords: climate change, climate variability, extreme events, population health, health systems\nWorldwide, in 2019, there were 396 disasters1 that killed 11,755 people, affected 95 million others, and cost nearly US$130 billion (28). Asia was the most affected continent with 40% of the events, 45% of the deaths, and 74% of all people affected. Floods and storms accounted for 68% of the number of affected people worldwide. Anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, land use change, and other activities impacting the global energy balance are altering the frequency and intensity of many extreme weather and climate events, with some regions experiencing increases in heat waves, floods, and droughts (84). Events influenced by climate change, particularly wildfires, also are increasing.\nRisks from extreme weather and climate events arise from the intersection of the physical hazard (e.g., wind and rain), the extent of exposure to the hazard, the vulnerability of individuals and communities, and the capacity to prepare for, manage, and recover from extreme events.\nA disaster generally is defined as a sudden, calamitous event that disrupts the functioning of a community or society and that exceeds its ability to cope using its own resources (81). The occurrence of an extreme event is not required for a community or region to experience extreme impacts, such as large increase in mortality; an extreme impact can arise from a moderately strong event when it occurs in a highly vulnerable population. The converse also is true, that an extreme event may not result in extreme impacts when communities are prepared.\nRoughly 20% of disasters in 2019 occurred in North America, including the Caribbean and Central America, for total damages of US$55 billion, of which US$29 billion were insured (130). Loss events included Hurricane Dorian, which caused billions of dollars in damage, especially in the Bahamas, in late August to early September. Heavy losses that year also resulted from severe weather, floods, and a winter storm in the United States. A mixture of snowmelt triggered by unusually high temperatures in March and storms with torrential rain led to sustained and extensive flooding in Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, and Mississippi (49).\nOverall, the numbers and costs of disasters have been increasing for several decades due to increases in exposure (more people moving into harm\u2019s way and increases in the values of property and infrastructure at risk), vulnerability of people and infrastructure, and climate change (170). Since 1980, the United States has experienced 265 weather and climate disasters in which the overall damages reached or exceeded US$1 billion; the total costs were greater than US$1.775 trillion (132), with an estimated 14,223 deaths (an average of 356 per year), although the numbers of deaths are likely an underestimate (178).\nBeyond the damage to infrastructure, extreme weather events and disasters can affect the health and well-being of individuals and can have catastrophic impacts on communities and health systems. People can suffer from a wide range of physical effects (e.g., heat exhaustion, injuries in severe storms, and respiratory illnesses from molds due to floods) as well as longer-term impacts on mental health. Health systems and facilities can be affected by impacts on patients and health care staff, medical and nonmedical supplies, facility operations, and critical infrastructures. To prepare for climate change, health-sector and emergency-management officials\u2014as well as urban planners, neighborhood services staff, and others\u2014require information about how hazards are projected to change, possible future exposures of people and property, likely changes in population health and health care infrastructure vulnerabilities, and needed capacities to prepare for and manage the events and their aftermath.\nWe review (a) the current impacts and projected risks of climate change on the health of populations and health systems from extreme weather and climate events and from wildfires, (b) the value of disaster management to reduce health risks from these changes, and (c) adaptation and mitigation measures that can explicitly address climate change in policies and planning processes.\nGlobal land surface air temperature has risen 1.53\u00b0C since the preindustrial period of 1850\u20131900, with considerable variation in regional warming; this increase is much larger than the observed warming combined over land and oceans (0.87\u00b0C) (84).

Asia was the most affected continent with 40% of the events, 45% of the deaths, and 74% of all people affected. Floods and storms accounted for 68% of the number of affected people worldwide. Anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, land use change, and other activities impacting the global energy balance are altering the frequency and intensity of many extreme weather and climate events, with some regions experiencing increases in heat waves, floods, and droughts (84). Events influenced by climate change, particularly wildfires, also are increasing.\nRisks from extreme weather and climate events arise from the intersection of the physical hazard (e.g., wind and rain), the extent of exposure to the hazard, the vulnerability of individuals and communities, and the capacity to prepare for, manage, and recover from extreme events.\nA disaster generally is defined as a sudden, calamitous event that disrupts the functioning of a community or society and that exceeds its ability to cope using its own resources (81). The occurrence of an extreme event is not required for a community or region to experience extreme impacts, such as large increase in mortality; an extreme impact can arise from a moderately strong event when it occurs in a highly vulnerable population. The converse also is true, that an extreme event may not result in extreme impacts when communities are prepared.\nRoughly 20% of disasters in 2019 occurred in North America, including the Caribbean and Central America, for total damages of US$55 billion, of which US$29 billion were insured (130). Loss events included Hurricane Dorian, which caused billions of dollars in damage, especially in the Bahamas, in late August to early September. Heavy losses that year also resulted from severe weather, floods, and a winter storm in the United States. A mixture of snowmelt triggered by unusually high temperatures in March and storms with torrential rain led to sustained and extensive flooding in Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, and Mississippi (49).\nOverall, the numbers and costs of disasters have been increasing for several decades due to increases in exposure (more people moving into harm\u2019s way and increases in the values of property and infrastructure at risk), vulnerability of people and infrastructure, and climate change (170). Since 1980, the United States has experienced 265 weather and climate disasters in which the overall damages reached or exceeded US$1 billion; the total costs were greater than US$1.775 trillion (132), with an estimated 14,223 deaths (an average of 356 per year), although the numbers of deaths are likely an underestimate (178).\nBeyond the damage to infrastructure, extreme weather events and disasters can affect the health and well-being of individuals and can have catastrophic impacts on communities and health systems. People can suffer from a wide range of physical effects (e.g., heat exhaustion, injuries in severe storms, and respiratory illnesses from molds due to floods) as well as longer-term impacts on mental health.

Exceeding 1.5\u00b0C could also trigger multiple climate tipping points ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nThe science is clear: to avert the worst impacts of climate change and preserve a liveable planet, global warming needs to be limited as much as possible and as a matter of urgency. (IPCC)\nUnder the Paris Agreement, countries agreed to substantially reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to enable the long-term global average surface temperature increase to be kept well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5\u00b0C.(Paris Agreement)\nCountries have emphasized that the impacts of climate change would be much lower at a temperature increase of 1.5\u00b0C, compared with 2\u00b0C, and expressed their firm resolve to pursue efforts to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C.(COP outcomes; IPCC)\nMonthly and annual breaches of 1.5\u00b0C do not mean that the world has failed to achieve the Paris Agreement\u2019s temperature goal, which refers to a long-term temperature increase over decades, not individual months or years. Temperatures for any single month or year fluctuate due to natural variability, including El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a and volcanic eruptions. Consequently, long-term temperature changes are typically considered on decadal timescales. (WMO)\nThe year 2024 was the warmest year in the 175-year observational record, with a global mean near-surface temperature 1.55\u00b0C above the 1850\u20131900 average.\nNevertheless, breaches of 1.5\u00b0C for a month or a year are early signs of getting perilously close to exceeding the long-term limit, and serve as clarion calls for increasing ambition and accelerating action in this critical decade. (UNEP).\nGlobal temperature changes are typically measured against the average temperature over a historical, pre-industrial baseline of 1850\u20131900. This baseline is the earliest period for which high-quality observations of surface temperatures over the land and ocean are available. (IPCC).\nThe first months with an average temperature that was more than 1.5\u00b0C above the pre-industrial average occurred during 2015-16, driven by both human-caused climate change and a strong, naturally occurring El Ni\u00f1o. The latter part of 2023 and early 2024 also experienced monthly average global temperature anomalies above 1.5\u00b0C. (WMO)\nThe first 12-month period to exceed 1.5\u00b0C as an average was February 2023 \u2013 January 2024, boosted by El Ni\u00f1o, when the average temperature worldwide was estimated to be 1.52\u00b0C higher than 1850\u20131900, according to one scientific dataset (Copernicus Climate Change Service). The likelihood of the annual average global temperature exceeding 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels for at least one year over the coming five years has increased significantly since 2015, when it was close to zero (WMO).\nThe global average temperature for the most recent 10-year period, from 2015 to 2024, is estimated to be the warmest 10-year period on record, at around 1.24 to 1.28\u00b0C above the 1850-1900 average (EEA). The 20-year average warming for 2001\u20132020 relative to 1850\u20131900 is 0.99\u00b0C (IPCC).\nEvery fraction of a degree of warming matters. With every additional increment of global warming, changes in extremes and risks become larger. For example, every additional 0.1\u00b0C of global warming causes clearly discernible increases in the intensity and frequency of temperature and precipitation extremes, as well as agricultural and ecological droughts in some regions. (IPCC)\nLimiting global warming to below 1.5\u00b0C will significantly reduce the risks, adverse impacts, and related losses and damages from climate change.

That\u2019s because the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change indicates that crossing the 1.5\u00b0C threshold risks unleashing far more severe climate change impacts, including more frequent and severe droughts, heatwaves and rainfall. To limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C, greenhouse gas emissions must peak before 2025 at the latest and decline 43% by 2030. The Paris Agreement is a landmark in the multilateral climate change process because, for the first time, a binding agreement brings all nations together to combat climate change and adapt to its effects.\nImplementation of the Paris Agreement requires economic and social transformation, based on the best available science. The Paris Agreement works on a five-year cycle of increasingly ambitious climate action -- or, ratcheting up -- carried out by countries. Since 2020, countries have been submitting their national climate action plans, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Each successive NDC is meant to reflect an increasingly higher degree of ambition compared to the previous version. Recognizing that accelerated action is required to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C, the COP27 cover decision requests Parties to revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in their NDCs to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2023, taking into account different national circumstances.\nIn their NDCs, countries communicate actions they will take to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in order to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement. Countries also communicate in their NDCs actions they will take to build resilience to adapt to the impacts of climate change.\nTo better frame the efforts towards the long-term goal, the Paris Agreement invites countries to formulate and submit long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies (LT-LEDS). LT-LEDS provide the long-term horizon to the NDCs. Unlike NDCs, they are not mandatory. Nevertheless, they place the NDCs into the context of countries\u2019 long-term planning and development priorities, providing a vision and direction for future development.\nThe Paris Agreement provides a framework for financial, technical and capacity building support to those countries who need it.\nThe Paris Agreement reaffirms that developed countries should take the lead in providing financial assistance to countries that are less endowed and more vulnerable, while for the first time also encouraging voluntary contributions by other Parties. Climate finance is needed for mitigation, because large-scale investments are required to significantly reduce emissions. Climate finance is equally important for adaptation, as significant financial resources are needed to adapt to the adverse effects and reduce the impacts of a changing climate.\nThe Paris Agreement speaks of the vision of fully realizing technology development and transfer for both improving resilience to climate change and reducing GHG emissions. It establishes a technology framework to provide overarching guidance to the well-functioning Technology Mechanism. The mechanism is accelerating technology development and transfer through its policy and implementation arms.\nNot all developing countries have sufficient capacities to deal with many of the challenges brought by climate change. As a result, the Paris Agreement places great emphasis on climate-related capacity-building for developing countries and requests all developed countries to enhance support for capacity-building actions in developing countries.\nWith the Paris Agreement, countries established an enhanced transparency framework (ETF). Under ETF, starting in 2024, countries will report transparently on actions taken and progress in climate change mitigation, adaptation measures and support provided or received. It also provides for international procedures for the review of the submitted reports.\nThe information gathered through the ETF will feed into the Global stocktake which will assess the collective progress towards the long-term climate goals.\nThis will lead to recommendations for countries to set more ambitious plans in the next round.\nAlthough climate change action needs to be massively increased to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, the years since its entry into force have already sparked low-carbon solutions and new markets. More and more countries, regions, cities and companies are establishing carbon neutrality targets. Zero-carbon solutions are becoming competitive across economic sectors representing 25% of emissions. This trend is most noticeable in the power and transport sectors and has created many new business opportunities for early movers.\nBy 2030, zero-carbon solutions could be competitive in sectors representing over 70% of global emissions.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

(IPCC)\nUnder the Paris Agreement, countries agreed to substantially reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to enable the long-term global average surface temperature increase to be kept well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5\u00b0C.(Paris Agreement)\nCountries have emphasized that the impacts of climate change would be much lower at a temperature increase of 1.5\u00b0C, compared with 2\u00b0C, and expressed their firm resolve to pursue efforts to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C.(COP outcomes; IPCC)\nMonthly and annual breaches of 1.5\u00b0C do not mean that the world has failed to achieve the Paris Agreement\u2019s temperature goal, which refers to a long-term temperature increase over decades, not individual months or years. Temperatures for any single month or year fluctuate due to natural variability, including El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a and volcanic eruptions. Consequently, long-term temperature changes are typically considered on decadal timescales. (WMO)\nThe year 2024 was the warmest year in the 175-year observational record, with a global mean near-surface temperature 1.55\u00b0C above the 1850\u20131900 average.\nNevertheless, breaches of 1.5\u00b0C for a month or a year are early signs of getting perilously close to exceeding the long-term limit, and serve as clarion calls for increasing ambition and accelerating action in this critical decade. (UNEP).\nGlobal temperature changes are typically measured against the average temperature over a historical, pre-industrial baseline of 1850\u20131900. This baseline is the earliest period for which high-quality observations of surface temperatures over the land and ocean are available. (IPCC).\nThe first months with an average temperature that was more than 1.5\u00b0C above the pre-industrial average occurred during 2015-16, driven by both human-caused climate change and a strong, naturally occurring El Ni\u00f1o. The latter part of 2023 and early 2024 also experienced monthly average global temperature anomalies above 1.5\u00b0C. (WMO)\nThe first 12-month period to exceed 1.5\u00b0C as an average was February 2023 \u2013 January 2024, boosted by El Ni\u00f1o, when the average temperature worldwide was estimated to be 1.52\u00b0C higher than 1850\u20131900, according to one scientific dataset (Copernicus Climate Change Service). The likelihood of the annual average global temperature exceeding 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels for at least one year over the coming five years has increased significantly since 2015, when it was close to zero (WMO).\nThe global average temperature for the most recent 10-year period, from 2015 to 2024, is estimated to be the warmest 10-year period on record, at around 1.24 to 1.28\u00b0C above the 1850-1900 average (EEA). The 20-year average warming for 2001\u20132020 relative to 1850\u20131900 is 0.99\u00b0C (IPCC).\nEvery fraction of a degree of warming matters. With every additional increment of global warming, changes in extremes and risks become larger. For example, every additional 0.1\u00b0C of global warming causes clearly discernible increases in the intensity and frequency of temperature and precipitation extremes, as well as agricultural and ecological droughts in some regions. (IPCC)\nLimiting global warming to below 1.5\u00b0C will significantly reduce the risks, adverse impacts, and related losses and damages from climate change. Failing to do so will lead to increasingly frequent and dangerous extreme weather events including heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, and heavy precipitation and flooding (IPCC). Extreme heat causes the greatest mortality of all extreme weather, with an estimated 489,000 heat-related deaths per year between 2000 and 2019 (WMO). Exceeding 1.5\u00b0C could also trigger multiple climate tipping points \u2014 such as breakdowns of major ocean circulation systems, abrupt thawing of boreal permafrost, and collapse of tropical coral reef systems \u2014 with abrupt, irreversible, and dangerous impacts for humanity.(Science)\nEven at current levels of global warming, we are already seeing devastating climate impacts, including intensifying extreme weather events, alarming reductions in ice sheets, sea ice, and glaciers, and several mass coral bleaching events, with widespread harms to people, economies, and nature (IPCC). In the last two decades, the 55 most climate-vulnerable economies alone have already experienced climate damages exceeding US$ 500 billion (UNEP). In 2024, disasters triggered a record 45.8 million internal displacements, of which 99.5 per cent were caused by weather-related hazards such as floods, storms, wildfires and droughts (UNDRR).\nHuman health impacts from climate change have been apparent for at least 20 years, but the climate crisis is still not treated like other global public health emergencies. Between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year from undernutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress alone. The cumulative death toll will likely be much higher, as climate change acts as a threat multiplier of many other extreme weather events and public health risks. (WHO)\nMany climate impacts, especially sea-level rise from ice sheets, disappearance of mountain glaciers, and ocean acidification, are essentially permanent for many generations to come and will take centuries to thousands of years to restore to even today\u2019s conditions. To minimize losses and damages, it is crucial to minimize the magnitude and duration of temporarily exceeding 1.5\u00b0C by urgently and significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions and phasing out fossil fuels. (New insights; IPCC)\nUnder global modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C with no or limited temporary overshoot, global greenhouse gas emissions peak by 2025, and are reduced by 43% by 2030 relative to 2019. carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reach net zero by 2050.

The origin of the 1.5\u00b0C Paris Agreement limit derived from the concern ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nThe science is clear: to avert the worst impacts of climate change and preserve a liveable planet, global warming needs to be limited as much as possible and as a matter of urgency. (IPCC)\nUnder the Paris Agreement, countries agreed to substantially reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to enable the long-term global average surface temperature increase to be kept well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5\u00b0C.(Paris Agreement)\nCountries have emphasized that the impacts of climate change would be much lower at a temperature increase of 1.5\u00b0C, compared with 2\u00b0C, and expressed their firm resolve to pursue efforts to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C.(COP outcomes; IPCC)\nMonthly and annual breaches of 1.5\u00b0C do not mean that the world has failed to achieve the Paris Agreement\u2019s temperature goal, which refers to a long-term temperature increase over decades, not individual months or years. Temperatures for any single month or year fluctuate due to natural variability, including El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a and volcanic eruptions. Consequently, long-term temperature changes are typically considered on decadal timescales. (WMO)\nThe year 2024 was the warmest year in the 175-year observational record, with a global mean near-surface temperature 1.55\u00b0C above the 1850\u20131900 average.\nNevertheless, breaches of 1.5\u00b0C for a month or a year are early signs of getting perilously close to exceeding the long-term limit, and serve as clarion calls for increasing ambition and accelerating action in this critical decade. (UNEP).\nGlobal temperature changes are typically measured against the average temperature over a historical, pre-industrial baseline of 1850\u20131900. This baseline is the earliest period for which high-quality observations of surface temperatures over the land and ocean are available. (IPCC).\nThe first months with an average temperature that was more than 1.5\u00b0C above the pre-industrial average occurred during 2015-16, driven by both human-caused climate change and a strong, naturally occurring El Ni\u00f1o. The latter part of 2023 and early 2024 also experienced monthly average global temperature anomalies above 1.5\u00b0C. (WMO)\nThe first 12-month period to exceed 1.5\u00b0C as an average was February 2023 \u2013 January 2024, boosted by El Ni\u00f1o, when the average temperature worldwide was estimated to be 1.52\u00b0C higher than 1850\u20131900, according to one scientific dataset (Copernicus Climate Change Service). The likelihood of the annual average global temperature exceeding 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels for at least one year over the coming five years has increased significantly since 2015, when it was close to zero (WMO).\nThe global average temperature for the most recent 10-year period, from 2015 to 2024, is estimated to be the warmest 10-year period on record, at around 1.24 to 1.28\u00b0C above the 1850-1900 average (EEA). The 20-year average warming for 2001\u20132020 relative to 1850\u20131900 is 0.99\u00b0C (IPCC).\nEvery fraction of a degree of warming matters. With every additional increment of global warming, changes in extremes and risks become larger. For example, every additional 0.1\u00b0C of global warming causes clearly discernible increases in the intensity and frequency of temperature and precipitation extremes, as well as agricultural and ecological droughts in some regions. (IPCC)\nLimiting global warming to below 1.5\u00b0C will significantly reduce the risks, adverse impacts, and related losses and damages from climate change. Failing to do so will lead to increasingly frequent and dangerous extreme weather events including heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, and heavy precipitation and flooding (IPCC). Extreme heat causes the greatest mortality of all extreme weather, with an estimated 489,000 heat-related deaths per year between 2000 and 2019 (WMO). Exceeding 1.5\u00b0C could also trigger multiple climate tipping points \u2014 such as breakdowns of major ocean circulation systems, abrupt thawing of boreal permafrost, and collapse of tropical coral reef systems \u2014 with abrupt, irreversible, and dangerous impacts for humanity.(Science)\nEven at current levels of global warming, we are already seeing devastating climate impacts, including intensifying extreme weather events, alarming reductions in ice sheets, sea ice, and glaciers, and several mass coral bleaching events, with widespread harms to people, economies, and nature (IPCC). In the last two decades, the 55 most climate-vulnerable economies alone have already experienced climate damages exceeding US$ 500 billion (UNEP). In 2024, disasters triggered a record 45.8 million internal displacements, of which 99.5 per cent were caused by weather-related hazards such as floods, storms, wildfires and droughts (UNDRR).\nHuman health impacts from climate change have been apparent for at least 20 years, but the climate crisis is still not treated like other global public health emergencies. Between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year from undernutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress alone. The cumulative death toll will likely be much higher, as climate change acts as a threat multiplier of many other extreme weather events and public health risks. (WHO)\nMany climate impacts, especially sea-level rise from ice sheets, disappearance of mountain glaciers, and ocean acidification, are essentially permanent for many generations to come and will take centuries to thousands of years to restore to even today\u2019s conditions. To minimize losses and damages, it is crucial to minimize the magnitude and duration of temporarily exceeding 1.5\u00b0C by urgently and significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions and phasing out fossil fuels. (New insights; IPCC)\nUnder global modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C with no or limited temporary overshoot, global greenhouse gas emissions peak by 2025, and are reduced by 43% by 2030 relative to 2019. carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reach net zero by 2050.

Changes to Earth\u2019s climate driven by increased human emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases are already having widespread effects on the environment: glaciers and ice sheets are shrinking, river and lake ice is breaking up earlier, plant and animal geographic ranges are shifting, and plants and trees are blooming sooner.\nEffects that scientists had long predicted would result from global climate change are now occurring, such as sea ice loss, accelerated sea level rise, and longer, more intense heat waves.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nSome changes (such as droughts, wildfires, and extreme rainfall) are happening faster than scientists previously assessed. In fact, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) \u2014 the United Nations body established to assess the science related to climate change \u2014 modern humans have never before seen the observed changes in our global climate, and some of these changes are irreversible over the next hundreds to thousands of years.\nScientists have high confidence that global temperatures will continue to rise for many decades, mainly due to greenhouse gases produced by human activities.\nThe IPCC\u2019s Sixth Assessment report, published in 2021, found that human emissions of heat-trapping gases have already warmed the climate by nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius) since 1850-1900.1 The global average temperature is expected to reach or exceed 1.5 degrees C (about 3 degrees F) within the next few decades. These changes will affect all regions of Earth.\nThe severity of effects caused by climate change will depend on the path of future human activities. More greenhouse gas emissions will lead to more climate extremes and widespread damaging effects across our planet. However, those future effects depend on the total amount of carbon dioxide we emit. So, if we can reduce emissions, we may avoid some of the worst effects.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nHere are some of the expected effects of global climate change on the United States, according to the Third and Fourth National Climate Assessment Reports:\nGlobal sea level has risen about 8 inches (0.2 meters) since reliable record-keeping began in 1880. By 2100, scientists project that it will rise at least another foot (0.3 meters), but possibly as high as 6.6 feet (2 meters) in a high-emissions scenario. Sea level is rising because of added water from melting land ice and the expansion of seawater as it warms.

Image credit: Khagani Hasanov, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0\nScientists project that hurricane-associated storm intensity and rainfall rates will increase as the climate continues to warm. Image credit: NASA\nDroughts in the Southwest and heat waves (periods of abnormally hot weather lasting days to weeks) are projected to become more intense, and cold waves less intense and less frequent. Image credit: NOAA\nWarming temperatures have extended and intensified wildfire season in the West, where long-term drought in the region has heightened the risk of fires. Scientists estimate that human-caused climate change has already doubled the area of forest burned in recent decades. By around 2050, the amount of land consumed by wildfires in Western states is projected to further increase by two to six times. Even in traditionally rainy regions like the Southeast, wildfires are projected to increase by about 30%.\nClimate change is having an uneven effect on precipitation (rain and snow) in the United States, with some locations experiencing increased precipitation and flooding, while others suffer from drought. On average, more winter and spring precipitation is projected for the northern United States, and less for the Southwest, over this century. Image credit: Marvin Nauman/FEMA\nThe length of the frost-free season, and the corresponding growing season, has been increasing since the 1980s, with the largest increases occurring in the western United States. Across the United States, the growing season is projected to continue to lengthen, which will affect ecosystems and agriculture.\nSummer of 2023 was Earth's hottest summer on record, 0.41 degrees Fahrenheit (F) (0.23 degrees Celsius (C)) warmer than any other summer in NASA\u2019s record and 2.1 degrees F (1.2 C) warmer than the average summer between 1951 and 1980. Image credit: NASA\nSea ice cover in the Arctic Ocean is expected to continue decreasing, and the Arctic Ocean will very likely become essentially ice-free in late summer if current projections hold. This change is expected to occur before mid-century.\nClimate change is bringing different types of challenges to each region of the country. Some of the current and future impacts are summarized below.

By 2100, scientists project that it will rise at least another foot (0.3 meters), but possibly as high as 6.6 feet (2 meters) in a high-emissions scenario. Sea level is rising because of added water from melting land ice and the expansion of seawater as it warms.

Image credit: Khagani Hasanov, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0\nScientists project that hurricane-associated storm intensity and rainfall rates will increase as the climate continues to warm. Image credit: NASA\nDroughts in the Southwest and heat waves (periods of abnormally hot weather lasting days to weeks) are projected to become more intense, and cold waves less intense and less frequent. Image credit: NOAA\nWarming temperatures have extended and intensified wildfire season in the West, where long-term drought in the region has heightened the risk of fires. Scientists estimate that human-caused climate change has already doubled the area of forest burned in recent decades. By around 2050, the amount of land consumed by wildfires in Western states is projected to further increase by two to six times. Even in traditionally rainy regions like the Southeast, wildfires are projected to increase by about 30%.\nClimate change is having an uneven effect on precipitation (rain and snow) in the United States, with some locations experiencing increased precipitation and flooding, while others suffer from drought. On average, more winter and spring precipitation is projected for the northern United States, and less for the Southwest, over this century. Image credit: Marvin Nauman/FEMA\nThe length of the frost-free season, and the corresponding growing season, has been increasing since the 1980s, with the largest increases occurring in the western United States. Across the United States, the growing season is projected to continue to lengthen, which will affect ecosystems and agriculture.\nSummer of 2023 was Earth's hottest summer on record, 0.41 degrees Fahrenheit (F) (0.23 degrees Celsius (C)) warmer than any other summer in NASA\u2019s record and 2.1 degrees F (1.2 C) warmer than the average summer between 1951 and 1980. Image credit: NASA\nSea ice cover in the Arctic Ocean is expected to continue decreasing, and the Arctic Ocean will very likely become essentially ice-free in late summer if current projections hold. This change is expected to occur before mid-century.\nClimate change is bringing different types of challenges to each region of the country.

Severe weather damage will also increase and ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nThe effects of human-caused global warming are happening now, are irreversible for people alive today, and will worsen as long as humans add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.\nGlobal climate change is not a future problem. Changes to Earth\u2019s climate driven by increased human emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases are already having widespread effects on the environment: glaciers and ice sheets are shrinking, river and lake ice is breaking up earlier, plant and animal geographic ranges are shifting, and plants and trees are blooming sooner.\nEffects that scientists had long predicted would result from global climate change are now occurring, such as sea ice loss, accelerated sea level rise, and longer, more intense heat waves.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nSome changes (such as droughts, wildfires, and extreme rainfall) are happening faster than scientists previously assessed. In fact, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) \u2014 the United Nations body established to assess the science related to climate change \u2014 modern humans have never before seen the observed changes in our global climate, and some of these changes are irreversible over the next hundreds to thousands of years.\nScientists have high confidence that global temperatures will continue to rise for many decades, mainly due to greenhouse gases produced by human activities.\nThe IPCC\u2019s Sixth Assessment report, published in 2021, found that human emissions of heat-trapping gases have already warmed the climate by nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius) since 1850-1900.1 The global average temperature is expected to reach or exceed 1.5 degrees C (about 3 degrees F) within the next few decades. These changes will affect all regions of Earth.\nThe severity of effects caused by climate change will depend on the path of future human activities. More greenhouse gas emissions will lead to more climate extremes and widespread damaging effects across our planet. However, those future effects depend on the total amount of carbon dioxide we emit. So, if we can reduce emissions, we may avoid some of the worst effects.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nHere are some of the expected effects of global climate change on the United States, according to the Third and Fourth National Climate Assessment Reports:\nGlobal sea level has risen about 8 inches (0.2 meters) since reliable record-keeping began in 1880. By 2100, scientists project that it will rise at least another foot (0.3 meters), but possibly as high as 6.6 feet (2 meters) in a high-emissions scenario. Sea level is rising because of added water from melting land ice and the expansion of seawater as it warms. Image credit: Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0\nGlobal climate is projected to continue warming over this century and beyond. Image credit: Khagani Hasanov, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0\nScientists project that hurricane-associated storm intensity and rainfall rates will increase as the climate continues to warm. Image credit: NASA\nDroughts in the Southwest and heat waves (periods of abnormally hot weather lasting days to weeks) are projected to become more intense, and cold waves less intense and less frequent. Image credit: NOAA\nWarming temperatures have extended and intensified wildfire season in the West, where long-term drought in the region has heightened the risk of fires. Scientists estimate that human-caused climate change has already doubled the area of forest burned in recent decades. By around 2050, the amount of land consumed by wildfires in Western states is projected to further increase by two to six times. Even in traditionally rainy regions like the Southeast, wildfires are projected to increase by about 30%.\nClimate change is having an uneven effect on precipitation (rain and snow) in the United States, with some locations experiencing increased precipitation and flooding, while others suffer from drought. On average, more winter and spring precipitation is projected for the northern United States, and less for the Southwest, over this century. Image credit: Marvin Nauman/FEMA\nThe length of the frost-free season, and the corresponding growing season, has been increasing since the 1980s, with the largest increases occurring in the western United States. Across the United States, the growing season is projected to continue to lengthen, which will affect ecosystems and agriculture.\nSummer of 2023 was Earth's hottest summer on record, 0.41 degrees Fahrenheit (F) (0.23 degrees Celsius (C)) warmer than any other summer in NASA\u2019s record and 2.1 degrees F (1.2 C) warmer than the average summer between 1951 and 1980. Image credit: NASA\nSea ice cover in the Arctic Ocean is expected to continue decreasing, and the Arctic Ocean will very likely become essentially ice-free in late summer if current projections hold. This change is expected to occur before mid-century.\nClimate change is bringing different types of challenges to each region of the country. Some of the current and future impacts are summarized below. These findings are from the Third3 and Fourth4 National Climate Assessment Reports, released by the U.S. Global Change Research Program.\n1.

In fact, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) \u2014 the United Nations body established to assess the science related to climate change \u2014 modern humans have never before seen the observed changes in our global climate, and some of these changes are irreversible over the next hundreds to thousands of years.\nScientists have high confidence that global temperatures will continue to rise for many decades, mainly due to greenhouse gases produced by human activities.\nThe IPCC\u2019s Sixth Assessment report, published in 2021, found that human emissions of heat-trapping gases have already warmed the climate by nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius) since 1850-1900.1 The global average temperature is expected to reach or exceed 1.5 degrees C (about 3 degrees F) within the next few decades. These changes will affect all regions of Earth.\nThe severity of effects caused by climate change will depend on the path of future human activities. More greenhouse gas emissions will lead to more climate extremes and widespread damaging effects across our planet. However, those future effects depend on the total amount of carbon dioxide we emit. So, if we can reduce emissions, we may avoid some of the worst effects.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nHere are some of the expected effects of global climate change on the United States, according to the Third and Fourth National Climate Assessment Reports:\nGlobal sea level has risen about 8 inches (0.2 meters) since reliable record-keeping began in 1880. By 2100, scientists project that it will rise at least another foot (0.3 meters), but possibly as high as 6.6 feet (2 meters) in a high-emissions scenario. Sea level is rising because of added water from melting land ice and the expansion of seawater as it warms.

Image credit: Khagani Hasanov, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0\nScientists project that hurricane-associated storm intensity and rainfall rates will increase as the climate continues to warm. Image credit: NASA\nDroughts in the Southwest and heat waves (periods of abnormally hot weather lasting days to weeks) are projected to become more intense, and cold waves less intense and less frequent. Image credit: NOAA\nWarming temperatures have extended and intensified wildfire season in the West, where long-term drought in the region has heightened the risk of fires. Scientists estimate that human-caused climate change has already doubled the area of forest burned in recent decades. By around 2050, the amount of land consumed by wildfires in Western states is projected to further increase by two to six times. Even in traditionally rainy regions like the Southeast, wildfires are projected to increase by about 30%.\nClimate change is having an uneven effect on precipitation (rain and snow) in the United States, with some locations experiencing increased precipitation and flooding, while others suffer from drought. On average, more winter and spring precipitation is projected for the northern United States, and less for the Southwest, over this century. Image credit: Marvin Nauman/FEMA\nThe length of the frost-free season, and the corresponding growing season, has been increasing since the 1980s, with the largest increases occurring in the western United States. Across the United States, the growing season is projected to continue to lengthen, which will affect ecosystems and agriculture.\nSummer of 2023 was Earth's hottest summer on record, 0.41 degrees Fahrenheit (F) (0.23 degrees Celsius (C)) warmer than any other summer in NASA\u2019s record and 2.1 degrees F (1.2 C) warmer than the average summer between 1951 and 1980. Image credit: NASA\nSea ice cover in the Arctic Ocean is expected to continue decreasing, and the Arctic Ocean will very likely become essentially ice-free in late summer if current projections hold. This change is expected to occur before mid-century.\nClimate change is bringing different types of challenges to each region of the country.

These events affect ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nThe effects of human-caused global warming are happening now, are irreversible for people alive today, and will worsen as long as humans add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.\nGlobal climate change is not a future problem. Changes to Earth\u2019s climate driven by increased human emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases are already having widespread effects on the environment: glaciers and ice sheets are shrinking, river and lake ice is breaking up earlier, plant and animal geographic ranges are shifting, and plants and trees are blooming sooner.\nEffects that scientists had long predicted would result from global climate change are now occurring, such as sea ice loss, accelerated sea level rise, and longer, more intense heat waves.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nSome changes (such as droughts, wildfires, and extreme rainfall) are happening faster than scientists previously assessed. In fact, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) \u2014 the United Nations body established to assess the science related to climate change \u2014 modern humans have never before seen the observed changes in our global climate, and some of these changes are irreversible over the next hundreds to thousands of years.\nScientists have high confidence that global temperatures will continue to rise for many decades, mainly due to greenhouse gases produced by human activities.\nThe IPCC\u2019s Sixth Assessment report, published in 2021, found that human emissions of heat-trapping gases have already warmed the climate by nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius) since 1850-1900.1 The global average temperature is expected to reach or exceed 1.5 degrees C (about 3 degrees F) within the next few decades. These changes will affect all regions of Earth.\nThe severity of effects caused by climate change will depend on the path of future human activities. More greenhouse gas emissions will lead to more climate extremes and widespread damaging effects across our planet. However, those future effects depend on the total amount of carbon dioxide we emit. So, if we can reduce emissions, we may avoid some of the worst effects.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nHere are some of the expected effects of global climate change on the United States, according to the Third and Fourth National Climate Assessment Reports:\nGlobal sea level has risen about 8 inches (0.2 meters) since reliable record-keeping began in 1880. By 2100, scientists project that it will rise at least another foot (0.3 meters), but possibly as high as 6.6 feet (2 meters) in a high-emissions scenario. Sea level is rising because of added water from melting land ice and the expansion of seawater as it warms.

Image credit: Khagani Hasanov, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0\nScientists project that hurricane-associated storm intensity and rainfall rates will increase as the climate continues to warm. Image credit: NASA\nDroughts in the Southwest and heat waves (periods of abnormally hot weather lasting days to weeks) are projected to become more intense, and cold waves less intense and less frequent. Image credit: NOAA\nWarming temperatures have extended and intensified wildfire season in the West, where long-term drought in the region has heightened the risk of fires. Scientists estimate that human-caused climate change has already doubled the area of forest burned in recent decades. By around 2050, the amount of land consumed by wildfires in Western states is projected to further increase by two to six times. Even in traditionally rainy regions like the Southeast, wildfires are projected to increase by about 30%.\nClimate change is having an uneven effect on precipitation (rain and snow) in the United States, with some locations experiencing increased precipitation and flooding, while others suffer from drought. On average, more winter and spring precipitation is projected for the northern United States, and less for the Southwest, over this century. Image credit: Marvin Nauman/FEMA\nThe length of the frost-free season, and the corresponding growing season, has been increasing since the 1980s, with the largest increases occurring in the western United States. Across the United States, the growing season is projected to continue to lengthen, which will affect ecosystems and agriculture.\nSummer of 2023 was Earth's hottest summer on record, 0.41 degrees Fahrenheit (F) (0.23 degrees Celsius (C)) warmer than any other summer in NASA\u2019s record and 2.1 degrees F (1.2 C) warmer than the average summer between 1951 and 1980. Image credit: NASA\nSea ice cover in the Arctic Ocean is expected to continue decreasing, and the Arctic Ocean will very likely become essentially ice-free in late summer if current projections hold. This change is expected to occur before mid-century.\nClimate change is bringing different types of challenges to each region of the country. Some of the current and future impacts are summarized below.
