    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nIt's my feelgood breakfast show. A feel good breakfast show. This is Espresso. Thank you so much for joining us on our live show this morning. Now before the break, I said health properties and there might be something in it for all of us when we talk about garlic. Now aside from the fact that it tastes incredible. We all know that garlic has both culinary and medical benefits. But scientists at the UC tea uh they say that they've uncovered garlic's cancer fighting properties. So in this new research UCT lecturer Dr. Katherine Kushula and her team, they've established how a compound, a compound found in crushed garlic cloves can actually kill cancer cells. And with us in studio to talk about it is Dr. Kula herself. Dr. Welcome to the show. Hi, lovely to be here. I'm excited about this because we're saying cancer killing properties from a compound that's found in crushed garlic cloves. Now, I want to get down to this. Why it needs to be crushed? Does it need to be heated? How effective is it in killing cancer? I mean what what are we talking about here? Well, the thing is I suppose because we are scientists and we're coming from the chemistry department, we actually want to understand what the compounds are that are present in garlic that are having this effect. And in actual fact, when the clove is first crushed, there's a compound allisonin which is released which is more antibacterial properties. But this compound actually changes over time when the preparation is heated as in a food preparation into this cancer fighting compound called auine. And it's got dulfide bonds in it, which means it also has this potent garlic smell. And we've actually shown that auine is able to enter into the cancer cell and it's actually able to disrupt the intracellular machinery in the cancer cell and bring about a toxic effect and kill that cancer cell. I'm gobsmacked that we're going back to natural remedies. I mean, you guys are scientists. We expect you to work with chemicals and all kinds of crazy stuff, but here we're talking about stuff that's in our kitchen cupboards. Can this property or auine like you you mentioned can it fight any type of cancer or is it only effective in some? Well, it's been shown to be cytotoxic to a range of different types of cancers. Although I think what's more relevant to the human condition because it's a dietary compound and there's a lot of epidemiological um evidence to show that actually populations of people who consume high quantities of garlic have lower incidence of gastrointestinal cancer specifically of the stomach and colon. So um I would think that you know you would probably obtain the highest concentration of this compound through a meal which has been prepared with the akawine in it. In other words, being cooked and probably exposure to um you know, oral exposure to gastrointestinal cancers would probably have a greater effect. Although we have shown in the laboratory that it is also able um to act against other cancer cell types, but I think for the human condition, it's probably more gastrointestinal tract. It's exciting because now that means we can add more garlic to our food because you're saying that we need to do it while cooking. This is also the first time that you see this because like you said, scientists wants to see how the auin or how the garlic properties actually work. What's the best way to try and consume it? I mean, take us back there. Should it always be crushed or cooked? Yes. Well, if you want to get this cancer fighting chemical, and I say it's a chemical, it's a natural compound, but it is still a chemical, and it's present in your garlic. You actually need to take your crushed clove and actually you need to take your clove, crush it, and then in order to achieve um this transformation of what's in the crushed clove into what's what's going to be present in your food preparation, you actually need to heat the preparation and you actually get a chemical transformation which takes place between a compound which is produced in the crush clove and then it gets transformed through heating into this aching compound. So um the the preparation would involve cooking of the clove which I think is actually a process which we do do when we prepare. So possibly we knew about this in some way. I don't know in some way or another doctor it's exciting stuff and it's exciting that even scientists are coming back to our kitchen to show us how to prepare things and to make things better. So thank you so much for joining us on our show today. Well there you heard it an excuse to add more garlic to that pizza. It's really good news. So make sure you try some on your next dinner date especially if you know him for the first time. Okay, but there's loads more happening on our feelood breakfast show. In fact, even though it can leave a smile the next day, we all know that garlic is so good for us. And it looks like Andrea has more details on this.",

A meta-analysis that included 5 cohort studies demonstrated a marginally increased risk of CRC with garlic supplements compared with nonuse (RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.02-1.36).4\nAn analysis of the prospective VITAL cohort study demonstrated no effect on risk of lung cancer with garlic supplement use compared with nonuse.5\nSeveral randomized controlled trials evaluated the relationship between garlic supplementation or extract and cancer. A small trial randomly assigned 51 patients with colorectal adenomas to high-dose aged garlic extract (AGE) or low-dose AGE as a control. After 1 year of treatment, patients taking high-dose AGE demonstrated a significantly lower number and size of colorectal adenomas compared with patients who received the low-dose AGE (P < .05 and P = .04, respectively).6\nAnother randomized, controlled trial included 3365 individuals aged 35 to 64 from China with baseline endoscopies, each of whom was assigned to receive amoxicillin and omeprazole for 2 weeks, vitamin C, E, and selenium for 7.3 years, or AGE and steam-distilled garlic oil for 7.3 years.7 After 4 and 8 years of follow-up, the risk of severe chronic atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, or gastric cancer was significantly lower with conventional Helicobacter pylori treatment (amoxicillin and omeprazole; OR, 0.77; 95% CI0.62-0.95 and OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.47-0.75), but not garlic supplementation. These findings were confirmed after 15 years of follow-up, though garlic supplementation resulted in a nonsignificant trend of reduced esophageal or gastric cancer (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.37-1.05).8\nA meta-analysis that included 7 cohort and 7 case-control studies found no association between garlic consumption and risk of CRC (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.82-1.06), though the risk of CRC was significantly decreased when only the case-control studies were included in the analysis (combined risk estimate, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.48-0.82).9\nGarlic consumption was associated with a lower risk of gastric cancer in several meta-analyses. One meta-analysis included 14 case-control, 1 cohort, and 2 randomized controlled trials with 8621 cases and 14,889 controls.10 Both high (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.38-0.62) and low garlic intake (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.58-0.97) were significantly associated with a reduced risk of gastric cancer. Another meta-analysis included 12 case-control studies and showed a significant reduction in gastric cancer with garlic consumption (RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.47-0.76).11\nTwo recent case-control studies conducted in Chinese populations demonstrated a lower risk of lung cancer with raw garlic consumption.12,13 One study included 1424 cases and 4543 healthy controls, and found that consumption of raw garlic at least 2 times per week significantly reduced the risk of lung cancer (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.44-0.72). In the other study, which included 399 cases and 466 healthy controls, raw garlic intake was significantly associated with a lower risk of lung cancer compared with no intake in a dose-response fashion (OR <2/week, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.39-0.81; OR \u22652/week, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.34-0.74; P trend = .0002). Among Western populations, however, this association was not observed.14\nA meta-analysis of 7 epidemiologic studies found that garlic intake was significantly associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.64-0.91).15\nThere are few data regarding the effect of garlic consumption on other types of cancer. Epidemiologic studies suggest that high garlic consumption may reduce the risk of larynx (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.38-0.82), esophageal (OR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.28-0.67), oral (OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.44-0.85), head and neck (OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.55-0.99), ovarian (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.62-0.98), renal cell (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.53-0.92), and endometrial (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.42-0.92) cancers.14,16,17\nEpidemiologic and several small randomized controlled trials suggest that garlic supplementation with a pill or extract does not reduce the risk of cancer, even among high risk patients. Epidemiologic evidence is mixed regarding the protective effect of garlic consumption against different cancer types. Garlic consumption may reduce the risk of some cancers, such as gastric, lung, and prostate cancer, but not others, such as CRC.\nReferences\nSign up for the latest news, education, & treatment resource information\nHaymarket Medical Network\nCancer Therapy Advisor, a trusted source of medical news and feature content for healthcare providers, offers clinicians insight into the latest research to inform clinical practice and improve patient outcomes.\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 Haymarket Media, Inc.
