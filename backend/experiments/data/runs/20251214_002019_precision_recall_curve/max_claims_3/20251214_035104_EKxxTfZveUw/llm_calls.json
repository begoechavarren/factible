    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nsomething happened this month that I want to make sure that people do not miss Donald Trump posted on Truth social this document it is a 32-page document containing all the latest information about what has been exposed about fraud in the 2020 election we're going to walk through this document this week on wolves and [Music] finance I need to start this video with a disclaimer YouTube policy does not allow you to say in videos that the certified results of elections were wrong so in keeping with this policy I will not be saying in this video whether Donald Trump did or did not win the 2020 election instead I'm going to be laying out all the facts and I'll let you decide for yourselves what I want you to do is watch this video all the way to the end and then leave a comment down below letting me know what you think do you think the 2020 election was stolen let me know in the comments below it's important to understand the context of President Trump's post he is currently facing a criminal Rico trial in Fulton County Georgia because he questioned the results of the 2020 election the case is based on a bizarre legal theory that Donald Trump knew that he lost the election but lied about it and committed fraud by trying to convince everyone that he actually won so the key question in the case was whether Donald Trump was lying when he claimed he won the 2020 election the district attorney bringing the case against Donald Trump is Fanny Willis it was revealed in a court filing this week that Fanny Willis has been sleeping with the special prosecutor she hired to handle the case against Trump the special prosecutor is named Nathan Wade and he has never filed a RICO case Fanny Willis has paid Nathan Wade more than $650,000 while they were sleeping together Fanny Willis has other attorneys working in her office with experience in Rico cases why in the world would she pay someone $650,000 who has no experience it turns out they would then use the money to pay for trips to places like the Caribbean this looks like obvious corruption and there is currently a motion filed to dismiss let's go back to when the case was first filed when President Trump was first arrested by Fanny Willis in August he announced that he was going to release a 100-page report containing evidence of fraud in the 2020 election that would prove the election was stolen he claimed it was a conclusive report and that all charges should be dropped against me and others now at the time he never released that report saying that his legal counsel wanted him to wait until trial I believe this new report that was just released this month is part of the president's conclusive report so what is in this new report it goes through all the swing states in the 2020 election for each state it gives a list of bullet points with evidence of fraud in the election each one of the bullet points comes with citations to sources backing up these claims this is important to understand these are not just random statements of fact the bullet points are backed up by detailed investigations which you can then read to get even more information now I'm not going to go through all the information in this report because there is a lot I'm going to review some of the more shocking highlights here is a list of all the swing states with the vote differences each of these states was called for Joe Biden some by very narrow margins Donald Trump only needed to win three of these states and he would have won the election the report argues that Donald Trump actually won all of these five states Georgia Wisconsin Pennsylvania Arizona and Michigan let's start with Georgia in my opinion this is the most obvious case of fraud it was reported that Trump lost Georgia by 11,779 votes in fton County we have video evidence of a poll worker named Ruby Freeman running the same stack of ballots through the counting machines multiple times ironically Ruby Freeman was later given the presidential citizens medal by Joe Biden for her work during the 2020 election Ruby Freeman has sued Rudy Giuliani for defamation in a Washington DC court and last month a mostly Democrat jury awarded Ruby Freeman a 100 $50 million verdict against Rudy Giuliani in the complaint Ruby Freeman explains that she did not like that Rudy Giuliani talked about the video of her and that Rudy Giuliani falsely accused her of counting the same ballots multiple times among other things she claims that since the election results were certified as correct that any statement made by Rudy Giuliani is false Rudy Giuliani was not allowed during the trial to submit one piece of evidence to the court now can someone please explain this to me how can there be a fair trial if the judge does not allow the defense to present any evidence that doesn't seem very fair to me there are some other unusual things about this case how is this case being tried in Washington DC Ruby Freeman is in Fulton County Georgia Rudy giuliani's comments were that she engaged Ed in election fraud in fton County Georgia why is this in Washington DC in the complaint Ruby Freeman explains that Rudy giuliani's comments were broadcast over the oan news channel which has an office in Washington DC Rudy Giuliani also worked in Washington DC as Donald Trump's lawyer so for that reason the case went to trial in Washington DC in front of a mostly Democrat jury Rudy Giuliani has already said that he plans to appeal the verdict it should be noted that Ruby Freeman's complaint states that this video does not show her committing illegal ballot counting but we can see with our own eyes that she counts the same stack of ballots multiple times what should we choose to believe her own statement or the video that we can see with our own eyes what do you think the problem with Ruby Freeman's statements is that the evidence provides a lot of doubt in the report from president trump it states fton county certified 59,4 in-person votes on Election Day despite the fact that only 14,522 evidence suggests the in-person vote total on Election Day was inflated by approximately 30 7,000 votes somehow a whole lot of votes came out of nowhere from people who did not exist could this have come from poll workers counting the same ballots multiple times remember that the vote difference in Georgia was only 11,779 votes and we are talking about a potential 37,000 fake ballots another issue in Georgia was the mail in ballots it's much easier to cheat with mail and ballots because anyone can drop it off in the mail you are relying on the people counting the votes like Ruby Freeman to do the honest thing and verify that the ballot is accurate before they count it well it turns out that in Georgia likely 67,2 184 votes were cast from voters with invalid residency these were people who did not actually live in Georgia but had their vote counted anyway remember remember the vote difference in Georgia was only 11,779 votes and just this issue alone would be 67,2 184 illegal votes there are many more bullet points about issues in the Georgia elections but I think you get the point there is a lot of evidence of election fraud in Georgia specifically in fton County so it is odd that fton county is the place that is criminally prosecuting Donald Trump for asking questions about the election it also seems like Fanny Willis is attempting to cover something up the next state is Wisconsin the vote difference was 20,625 an exception that you could vote by mail without having to show your ID this resulted in 220,00 44 votes cast from individuals who were Exempted from showing voter ID that would be incredibly easy to cheat if you never had to show an ID we are talking about a vote difference of 20,625 votes were cast without an ID this this problem really shows itself when we look at nursing homes nursing homes in Milwaukee Dayne and Racine counties had 100% turnout so you're telling me that 100% of people in nursing homes voted some people in nursing homes are nearing death so even people who were literally on their deathbeds got up and voted something just doesn't sound right to me about that in one example Merill Barrett who was 104 years old and did not recognize her own children had a ballot cast in her name in the 2020 presidential election okay now how obvious do we have to get that some funny business is going on again there are many more bullet points about issues in Wisconsin but I think you get the point the next state is Pennsylvania the vote difference in Pennsylvania was 8,555 votes now now that sounds like a lot until you find out that there were 121,50 more votes than voters Pennsylvania uses a voting system called sure the Statewide uniform registry of electors they were never able to reconcile the number of votes that were counted with the number of people who were registered to vote so the vote difference was 8,555 votes and there were 121 , 240 more votes than voters this is another example where there are many more bullet points in the report but this one fact alone raises a lot of questions for me the next state is Arizona this is the closest vote margin with only 10,457 votes Arizona did some of the most blatantly illegal things I don't know if you remember this but Arizona took a really long time to count their ballots the election took place on November 3rd well they didn't finish counting the ballots until November 30th well it turns out they were accepting and Counting ballots after the election day these were illegal votes here's a quote from the report Maricopa County accepted 20,500 mailin ballots after election day by law ballots must be received no later than 700 p.m. on Election Day which was November 3rd so the election was over the deadline was passed and they were still receiving and Counting ballots days after the election was over these are illegal votes the vote margin was 10,457 votes this one example accounts for 20,500 ballots what makes matters worse is that the meropa County elections Department withheld this information from public records requests for for 7 months after the elections no one knew this was going on until it was too late to protest the election this looks a lot like cheating also just like in the other states it looks like some of the votes were completely made up two precincts in Puma County had over 100% turnout for mailin ballots can someone in the comments please explain to me how this can happen because I'm really having a hard time understanding this how is it possible to have more than 100% of people vote how is that possible what is even more suspicious is the Arizona Secretary of State during the 2020 election was someone named Katie Hobbs she is the person responsible for running the election it turns out 2 years later she somehow became the governor of Arizona in 2022 she ran against car Lake Katie Hobbs miraculously won against all polling predictions and Katie Hobbs certified her own election count naming herself the winner ktie hobb's election is still being contested in the courts with Arizona there are many more bullet points in president Trump's report but I think you get the point the next state is Michigan the vote difference is votes now this is the largest vote difference out of the Swing States and it sounds like a lot until you find out that Michigan has 271,000 delivered in a van at 3:30 a.m. past the 8:00 p.m. deadline this was 50 boxes of ballots each containing thousands of ballots how can they count ballots that were received after the deadline when we look at the ballot counts we can see the spike that came from the suspicious ballots Michigan was also the state where we now know there was a police investigation of a company called GB bi strategies the police raided a gbi strategies office to find thousands of fraudulent voter registrations the forms were in the same handwriting and used fake addresses gbi strategies was funded by a super pack called black pack which paid the firm 11,254 n19 to register voters for Joe Biden in 2020 these people were not only only under investigation for cheating during the election they were making an awful lot of money doing it again there are many more bullet points in the report but I think you get the point so that was the report that was posted by President Trump going through the five swing states in the 2020 election again I'm not going to say whether the election was or was not stolen I want you to decide what do you think was the 2020 election stolen let me know in the comments down below and if you like this video don't forget to hit that

Jon Ossoff and Rev. Raphael Warnock defeated Republican Sens. ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAtlanta - Using the same equipment as in the 2020 election, an audit of the Republican race in the 2024 Presidential Preference Primary confirmed former President Donald Trump as the winner. This week, all 159 Georgia counties conducted a post-election audit of ballots cast in the March 12th Republican Presidential Preference Primary. As part of the audit, every Georgia county was required to count randomly selected ballots totaling 413 batches from across the state, or 7.5% of ballots overall. The risk limiting audit was conducted with a 5% risk limit.\nBelow is a comparison of the vote totals for each candidate for the batches that were audited:\nThis small amount of difference is well within the expected margin of error for an audit of this size, and it is largely caused by human error during the hand counting process.\nGeorgia law mandates that risk-limiting audits must be conducted following any election with statewide or federal contests. All counties participated in the required Risk-Limiting Audit that confirmed the original result as tabulated by the voting equipment. Notably, every audit of a race in Georgia, including the hand-count audit of the 2020 election results, have confirmed that the system functioned properly and that the result was correct.\n\u201cOur county election directors are always going above and beyond,\u201d said Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. \u201cTheir hard work secures our voting system, building trust in communities across the state.\u201d\nAs in November 2022, Georgia\u2019s audit was supported by VotingWorks and their Arlo auditing software.\nCLICK HERE for a report with audit summary data.\nCLICK HERE for a zip file with all of the ballot manifests and machine batch tallies. This includes all batches statewide, including those that were audited. You can confirm that these were the same batch tallies that we started the audit with by performing a SHA256 hash of the file and matching it to the tweet from Gabriel Sterling (@GabrielSterling) from 03/19/2024 at 8:57PM Eastern Time.\n###\nGeorgia is recognized as a national leader in elections. It was the first state in the country to implement the trifecta of automatic voter registration, at least 17 days of early voting (which has been called the \u201cgold standard\u201d), and no-excuse absentee voting. Georgia continues to set records for voter turnout and election participation, seeing the largest increase in average turnout of any other state in the 2018 midterm election and record turnout in 2020, and 2022. 2022 achieved the largest single day of in-person early voting turnout in Georgia midterm history utilizing Georgia\u2019s secure, paper ballot voting system. Most recently, Georgia ranked #1 for Election Integrity by the Heritage Foundation, a top ranking for Voter Accessibility by the Center for Election Innovation & Research and tied for number one in Election Administration by the Bipartisan Policy Center.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This weekend, he delivered a new false claim ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nFormer President Donald Trump keeps telling the lie that he won Georgia in the 2020 election. This weekend, he delivered a new false claim in support of that old false claim.\nTrump\u2019s deception about what happened in Georgia has not relented even as he prepares to turn himself in this week to face charges in Fulton County over his efforts to overturn his 2020 defeat to Joe Biden. On Saturday, he posted on social media that despite having won Georgia in 2016, doing a \u201cfantastic job\u201d as president and earning millions more votes in 2020 than he did in 2016 and more votes than a sitting president had ever received before, he had \u201cshockingly, \u2018LOST\u2019 Georgia\u201d \u2013 putting lost in quotation marks.\nTrump then continued, \u201cAll this despite winning nearby Alabama and South Carolina in Record Setting Landslides.\u201d He concluded the post: \u201cDoes anybody really believe I lost Georgia? I DON\u2019T!\u201d\nFacts First: Trump lost Georgia fair and square in 2020, by 11,779 votes, and his claim that he won South Carolina and Alabama in record landslides is not even close to true. Numerous previous candidates have earned far larger margins of victory in South Carolina and Alabama than Trump did in 2020. Even Trump himself won each state by a larger margin in 2016 than he did in 2020 \u2013 a fact that contravenes his insinuation that his 2020 failure in Georgia was mysteriously at odds with a better-than-ever performance elsewhere in the region.\nThe decline in Trump\u2019s Georgia margin between 2016 and 2020 (about 5.4 percentage points) was larger than his declines in South Carolina (about 2.6 points) and Alabama (about 2.3 points), both of which he won big in both elections, but that does not suggest that anything nefarious happened in Georgia. States are simply different. Adjacent states often have social, economic and political differences that can lead to divergences in their voting habits.\nAudrey Haynes, a University of Georgia political science professor, called Trump\u2019s reasoning \u201csimplistic and faulty.\u201d She said in a Sunday email: \u201cThat statement assumes that those states are so similar that they would produce the same outcome. But they aren\u2019t identical. And they did not produce identical results.\u201d\nThere are various other sets of neighboring states where the election results diverged between 2016 and 2020. For example, Trump lost Minnesota by about 7.1 points in 2020 (about 5.6 points worse than in 2016) while winning neighboring North Dakota in 2020 by about 33.4 points (only about 2.4 points worse than in 2016). That\u2019s not a sign that something nefarious occurred in Minnesota. Again, those two states are just not identical.\nWe\u2019ll outline some of the key distinctions between Georgia, South Carolina and Alabama in a moment. First, we\u2019ll thoroughly debunk Trump\u2019s claim that he won by \u201cRecord Setting Landslides\u201d in South Carolina and Alabama in 2020.\nTrump won South Carolina in 2020 by about 11.7 percentage points. That was a decline of about 2.6 percentage points from his own 2016 margin in the state (about 14.3 points), so it obviously wasn\u2019t a \u201cRecord Setting Landslide\u201d even for Trump himself.\nAnd his 11.7-point margin in 2020 was nowhere near record-setting even if you don\u2019t count 2016.\nFranklin D. Roosevelt won South Carolina by about 96 percentage points in 1932 and then topped it with a margin of about 97 points in 1936. Before Roosevelt, Democratic candidates won South Carolina by more than 82 points in all eight presidential elections from 1900 through 1928.\nLooking at more recent outcomes, Trump\u2019s 11.7-point margin in the state in 2020 was smaller than the margin earned by the state winner in 7 of the 14 presidential elections from 1960 through 2012: George W. Bush in 2000 (about 16 points) and again in 2004 (about 17 points), George H.W. Bush in 1988 (about 24 points), Ronald Reagan in 1984 (about 28 points), Jimmy Carter in 1976 (about 13 points), Richard Nixon in 1972 (about 43 points) and Barry Goldwater in 1964 (about 18 points).\nTrump won Alabama in 2020 by about 25.5 percentage points. That margin was a rounded decline of about 2.3 percentage points from his 2016 margin (about 27.7 points), so, again, clearly not a record.\nAnd Trump\u2019s 2020 margin was vastly exceeded by Roosevelt, who earned a roughly 74-point victory in the state in 1936 and never had an Alabama margin less than 63 points between 1932 and 1944. Woodrow Wilson\u2019s margins in the state also exceeded 50 points in both 1912 and 1916.\nMore recently, Trump\u2019s 25.5-point margin was narrowly beaten by George W. Bush\u2019s Alabama margin in 2004 (about 25.6 points) and handily beaten by Nixon\u2019s margin in 1972 (about 47 points).\nThere is no evidence that Georgia or any other state had anywhere close to enough fraud in 2020 to have changed the winner. After Trump promised last week to hold a news conference this Monday to reveal supposedly \u201cirrefutable\u201d evidence of 2020 fraud in Georgia, he later called off the event and posted that his lawyers wanted him to put the so-called evidence in legal filings instead.\nSo why, if not fraud, would there be a bigger decline in Trump\u2019s Georgia margin between 2016 and 2020 than there was in his South Carolina and Alabama margins between 2016 and 2020? Because they are different places that are experiencing different sociopolitical trends.\nGeorgia became substantially more racially diverse in the decade leading up to the 2020 election in large part because of an influx of residents to Atlanta and its suburbs, experiencing spikes in its Black, Latino and Asian populations at the same time as a small decline in its number of residents identifying as White alone; South Carolina and Alabama experienced far less racial diversification over the same time period. Across the country, Black, Latino and Asian voters tended to vote for Biden in 2020, while White voters tended to vote for Trump.\nGeorgia had a higher percentage of 2020 residents with at least a bachelor\u2019s degree than either South Carolina or Alabama; Democrats made majo\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Trump had been defeated by Joe Biden in the election, but refused to accept the outcome,[1] and made a months-long effort to overturn the results. Prior to the call to Raffensperger, Trump and his campaign spoke repeatedly to state and local officials in at least three states in which he had lost, urging them to recount votes, throw out some ballots,[2][3] or replace the Democratic slate of electors with a Republican slate. Trump's call with Raffensperger was released by The Washington Post and other media outlets the next day,[4][5][6] after Trump made a statement about the call on Twitter.\nAccording to the publicly released recording of the call and reports made by multiple news agencies, Trump attempted to pressure Raffensperger into reinvestigating the election results, despite being repeatedly told that there was no electoral error. Trump's repeated efforts to convince Raffensperger to find some basis to overturn the election results were perceived as pleading and threatening. At one point on the call, Trump told Raffensperger, \"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have, because we won the state.\"[7] During the call, Trump falsely suggested that Raffensperger could have committed a criminal offense by refusing to overturn the state's election results.[6] Legal experts have suggested that Trump's behavior and demands could have violated state and federal laws.[8][9][10]\nOn January 11, the phone call was cited in the article of impeachment in the second impeachment of Donald Trump introduced in the House of Representatives.[11] Raffensperger's office opened a fact-finding and administrative investigation of potential election interference regarding Trump's efforts to overturn the results in Georgia, and Fulton County prosecutors opened a criminal investigation in February of the same year.[12][13] On August 14, 2023, Trump, along with 18 co-defendants, was indicted in Fulton County on charges including racketeering and fraud. The phone call was a central element of the indictment.[14]\nIn the 2020 United States presidential election, former Vice President Joe Biden defeated incumbent President Donald Trump. Trump and his campaign falsely claimed that voting fraud had cost him electoral victory in several states, including Georgia. Trump's claims were rejected and found to be baseless by numerous state and federal judges, elected officials, governors, and government agencies, including his own administration's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).[15][16][17][18][19][20][21][excessive citations] Trump's attempts to overturn the election cost taxpayers $519 million according to an analysis by The Washington Post, including $488 million in security fees during and after the U.S. Capitol attack, and $2.2 million in legal fees.[22]\nTrump's many legal challenges to the election results were unsuccessful, but he repeatedly refused to accept the outcome of the election. Audits and hand recounts revealed no evidence of fraud or any irregularity that would have changed the election results.[23][24][25] Biden was officially confirmed the winner of Georgia on November 19.[26]\nIn November and December, as his lawsuits were repeatedly rejected in court, Trump personally communicated with Republican local and state officials in at least three states: Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Georgia. He talked in person or via phone to state legislators, state attorneys general, and governors, pressuring them to recount the votes, throw out some of the ballots, or get the state legislature to replace the elected Democratic slate of Electoral College members with a Republican slate of electors chosen by the legislature[27][28] in order to overturn the election results in their states. In December he spoke by phone to the governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, and made public demands on the secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, both Republicans who had supported Trump in the election. He demanded that they reverse the Georgia election results, threatened them with political retaliation when they did not, strongly criticized them in speeches and tweets, and tweeted that Kemp should resign.[29][30]\nOn December 23, 2020, Trump called the chief investigator for the Georgia secretary of state's office, who was then conducting a ballot audit in Cobb County. Raffensperger had ordered the audit in response to allegations of fraud. Trump asked her to scrutinize the ballots and said she would find \"dishonesty\". The Washington Post reported on the telephone conversation with apparent quotations of Trump's comments to the chief investigator. It based these quotations on an anonymous source purportedly familiar with the call. At the time of its reporting, it emphasized that Trump had instructed the investigator to \"find the fraud\" and that she would be a \"national hero\" if she did so. Based on this reporting, some legal experts said that this phone call appeared to be bribery or obstruction on Trump's part. On December 29, the audit ended. Georgia officials concluded that there was no fraud. Trump was unhappy with those results.[31]\nSecretary of State Raffensperger acknowledged Trump's December 23 phone call to the chief investigator during a Good Morning America interview on January 4.[32] The Washington Post revealed more details of the phone call on January 9, but did not reveal the name of the chief investigator to protect that person's safety.[31] Other news outlets published similar stories and stated that they had corroborated the story with their own investigations.[33][34] In the second impeachment against Trump, House managers specifically cited the purported statements to the Georgia investigator as part of the ev\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Previously uncounted ballots discovered during the hand count reduced the margin to 12,284 votes, the Georgia secretary of state's office reported.\n\"The recount process simply reaffirmed what we already knew: Georgia voters selected Joe Biden to be their next president,\" said Jaclyn Rothenberg, Georgia communications director for the Biden campaign. \"We are grateful to the election officials, volunteers and workers for working overtime and under unprecedented circumstances to complete this recount as the utmost form of public service.\"\nTrump's campaign said in a statement that the recount went as it expected because it \"recounted all of the illegal ballots that had been included in the total.\"\n\"We continue to demand that Georgia conduct an honest recount, which includes signature matching,\" said Jenna Ellis, the campaign's senior legal adviser. \"We intend to pursue all legal options to ensure that only legal ballots are counted.\"\nThe hand recount of nearly 5 million votes stemmed from an audit required by a new state law, not from any suspected problems with the state's results or an official recount request. The state has until Friday to certify the results that the counties have certified and submitted.\nOnce the state certifies the election results, the losing campaign has two business days to request a recount if the margin remains within 0.5 percent. That recount would be done using scanners that read and tally the votes, and it would be paid for by the counties, said Gabriel Sterling, who oversees Georgia's voting systems.\nIt was up to Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to select the race to be audited, and he said the presidential race made the most sense because of its significance and the tight margin separating the candidates. Because of the small margin, Raffensperger said, a full hand recount was necessary.\nRaffensperger said in a statement Thursday that the results reaffirm the integrity of the state's election process.\n\"Georgia's historic first statewide audit reaffirmed that the state's new secure paper ballot voting system accurately counted and reported results,\" he said. \"This is a credit to the hard work of our county and local elections officials who moved quickly to undertake and complete such a momentous task in a short period of time.\"\nRaffensperger's office said in the statement that the highest error rate in any county recount was 0.73 percent. Most counties had no changes in their final tallies. The majority of the remaining counties had changes of fewer than 10 ballots.\nOther counties found slight differences in results as they did their hand counts; state election officials had consistently said that was to be expected.\nDartunorro Clark covered national politics, including the Covid-19 recovery, for NBC News.\n\u00a9 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",
