A weak immune system increases susceptibility to infections and allows infections to become more severe. One component of the immune response is inflammation. Where inflammation is excessive or uncontrolled it can damage host tissues and cause pathology. Limitation of oxidative stress is one means of controlling inflammation. Citrus fruit juices are a particularly good source of vitamin C and folate, which both have roles in sustaining the integrity of immunological barriers and in supporting the function of many types of immune cell including phagocytes, natural killer cells, T-cells and B-cells. Vitamin C is an antioxidant and reduces aspects of the inflammatory response. Important bioactive polyphenols in citrus fruit juices include hesperidin, narirutin and naringin. Hesperidin is a glycoside of hesperetin while narirutin and naringin are glycosides of naringenin. Hesperidin, hesperetin, naringenin, naringin and narirutin have all been found to have anti-inflammatory effects in model systems, and human trials of hesperidin report reductions in inflammatory markers. In humans, orange juice was shown to limit the post-prandial inflammation induced by a high fat-high carbohydrate meal. Consuming orange juice daily for a period of weeks has been reported to reduce markers of inflammation, including C-reactive protein, as confirmed through a recent meta-analysis. A newly emerging topic is whether polyphenols from orange juice have direct anti-viral effects. In summary, micronutrients and other bioactives present in citrus fruit juices have established roles in controlling oxidative stress and inflammation and in supporting innate and acquired immune responses. Trials in humans demonstrate that orange juice reduces inflammation; its effects on innate and acquired immunity require further exploration in well-designed trials in appropriate population sub-groups such as older people.\nKeywords: immunity, inflammation, infection, cytokine, oxidative stress, vitamin C, folate, bioactives\nThe role of the immune system is to protect the individual against pathogenic organisms including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. There is a wide array of potentially threatening organisms in the environment. Thus, in order to provide effective protection, the human immune system has evolved to include many different cell types and communicating molecules, and multiple functional responses. The immune system has four general actions. Firstly, it acts as a barrier keeping microbes from entering the body. Examples of barriers include the skin; the mucosal lining of the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and genitourinary tracts; the acid pH of the stomach which kills many bacteria; and anti-microbial proteins in secretions such as tears and saliva. Secondly, the immune system acts to recognise microbes and to identify whether they are harmful or not. Recognition can be of general structural features of microbes (called molecular patterns) or of specific and unique microbial antigens. The mechanism of recognition involves ligand-receptor pairs, but these are different for recognition of molecular patterns compared with recognition of specific antigens and the type of response that is initiated is also different; this is elaborated further in this section. Thirdly, the immune system acts to eliminate those microbes identified as being harmful; this involves the destructive actions of various types of immune cell. Fourthly and finally, the immune response generates immunological memory. This involves long-term maintenance of memory T lymphocytes (T cells) and B lymphocytes (B cells) so that, if there is re-exposure to the harmful microbe, the immune response becomes faster and stronger than it was for the original response. The generation of immunological memory is the basis of vaccination. These complex and sophisticated actions can be achieved because the human immune system is comprised of many cell types ( Figure 1 ) (1), each with their own individual functional capabilities. These different cell types interact with one another as part of the immune response to assure effective protection of the host from pathogens. The immune system may be classified in different ways, most commonly into innate (or natural) and acquired (or adaptive) immunity ( Figure 1 ).\nThe components of the immune system and their division into innate and acquired immunity. IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin; ILCs, innate lymphoid cells; MAIT, mucosal associated invariant T; TGF, transforming growth factor; TNF, tumour necrosis factor. Taken from (1).\nInnate (sometimes called natural) immunity includes the barrier functions and the cells involved in recognition of molecular patterns on microbes (these are called microbe-associated molecular patterns or MAMPs) and the subsequent destruction of those microbes. Examples of MAMPs include the cell wall lipopolysaccharides of Gram-negative bacteria and the peptidoglycans of Gram-positive bacteria. These general structural features are recognised by pattern recognition receptors; toll-like receptors are examples of pattern recognition receptors but there are many others. The typical response following recognition would be to engulf the microbe carrying the MAMP by the process of phagocytosis, with subsequent destruction of the microbe within lysosomes by the so-called respiratory burst which generates destructive reactive oxygen species. Neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells are all phagocytic cells. The inflammatory response is also triggered by this process, with the aim of creating an environment that is hostile to the invading microbes; in fact, an inflammatory response can be triggered by isolated MAMPs, not only by microbes bearing MAMPs. Note too that the inflammatory response can be damaging to the host if it is not properly controlled and m\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Fact: It\u2019s not necessary to ingest antioxidant-supplemented food or drink. Your body benefits from a simple, balanced variety of plant-based foods and vibrant colors \u2014 fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds.\nFiction: Antioxidants cure illness. Fact: Antioxidants are not curative but help reduce the risk of cancers and other diseases.\nFiction: All vitamins and minerals are antioxidants. Fact: Only certain vitamins and minerals have antioxidant properties, including:\nFiction: Antioxidants can reverse aging or assist with healthy aging. Fact: Although oxidative stress can affect aging, antioxidant drinks and food can\u2019t reverse that process. They may, however, help slow the aging process in some people.\nFiction: The more antioxidants you consume, the better. Fact: It\u2019s possible to consume formulated antioxidants to excess, with negative side effects similar to overuse of a vitamin or mineral. However, there\u2019s little chance you\u2019ll get \u201ctoo many\u201d antioxidants from natural sources such as fruits and vegetables.\nIs there a recommended daily amount of antioxidants? No, they don\u2019t have the same recommended measures as our macros (fat, protein, carbs) and micros (vitamins and nutrients).\nIf you feel your diet lacks fruit and vegetables, specifically formulated drinks or supplements may supply you with helpful antioxidants.\nBut first, strive to fill your plate with vibrant fruits and vegetables that give you the antioxidants you need. A nourishing diet calls for a good variety and balance of phytonutrients in these rainbow colors:\nAt Signature Healthcare, we encourage great nutrition habits that bring you the true power of antioxidants.

Antioxidants are certain nutrients, such as vitamins C or E, or carotenoids, which may help protect cells against daily damage.\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nThe immune system provides defence to the host against pathogenic organisms. A weak immune system increases susceptibility to infections and allows infections to become more severe. One component of the immune response is inflammation. Where inflammation is excessive or uncontrolled it can damage host tissues and cause pathology. Limitation of oxidative stress is one means of controlling inflammation. Citrus fruit juices are a particularly good source of vitamin C and folate, which both have roles in sustaining the integrity of immunological barriers and in supporting the function of many types of immune cell including phagocytes, natural killer cells, T-cells and B-cells. Vitamin C is an antioxidant and reduces aspects of the inflammatory response. Important bioactive polyphenols in citrus fruit juices include hesperidin, narirutin and naringin. Hesperidin is a glycoside of hesperetin while narirutin and naringin are glycosides of naringenin. Hesperidin, hesperetin, naringenin, naringin and narirutin have all been found to have anti-inflammatory effects in model systems, and human trials of hesperidin report reductions in inflammatory markers. In humans, orange juice was shown to limit the post-prandial inflammation induced by a high fat-high carbohydrate meal. Consuming orange juice daily for a period of weeks has been reported to reduce markers of inflammation, including C-reactive protein, as confirmed through a recent meta-analysis. A newly emerging topic is whether polyphenols from orange juice have direct anti-viral effects. In summary, micronutrients and other bioactives present in citrus fruit juices have established roles in controlling oxidative stress and inflammation and in supporting innate and acquired immune responses. Trials in humans demonstrate that orange juice reduces inflammation; its effects on innate and acquired immunity require further exploration in well-designed trials in appropriate population sub-groups such as older people.\nKeywords: immunity, inflammation, infection, cytokine, oxidative stress, vitamin C, folate, bioactives\nThe role of the immune system is to protect the individual against pathogenic organisms including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. There is a wide array of potentially threatening organisms in the environment. Thus, in order to provide effective protection, the human immune system has evolved to include many different cell types and communicating molecules, and multiple functional responses. The immune system has four general actions. Firstly, it acts as a barrier keeping microbes from entering the body. Examples of barriers include the skin; the mucosal lining of the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and genitourinary tracts; the acid pH of the stomach which kills many bacteria; and anti-microbial proteins in secretions such as tears and saliva. Secondly, the immune system acts to recognise microbes and to identify whether they are harmful or not. Recognition can be of general structural features of microbes (called molecular patterns) or of specific and unique microbial antigens. The mechanism of recognition involves ligand-receptor pairs, but these are different for recognition of molecular patterns compared with recognition of specific antigens and the type of response that is initiated is also different; this is elaborated further in this section. Thirdly, the immune system acts to eliminate those microbes identified as being harmful; this involves the destructive actions of various types of immune cell. Fourthly and finally, the immune response generates immunological memory. This involves long-term maintenance of memory T lymphocytes (T cells) and B lymphocytes (B cells) so that, if there is re-exposure to the harmful microbe, the immune response becomes faster and stronger than it was for the original response. The generation of immunological memory is the basis of vaccination. These complex and sophisticated actions can be achieved because the human immune system is comprised of many cell types ( Figure 1 ) (1), each with their own individual functional capabilities. These different cell types interact with one another as part of the immune response to assure effective protection of the host from pathogens. The immune system may be classified in different ways, most commonly into innate (or natural) and acquired (or adaptive) immunity ( Figure 1 ).\nThe components of the immune system and their division into innate and acquired immunity. IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin; ILCs, innate lymphoid cells; MAIT, mucosal associated invariant T; TGF, transforming growth factor; TNF, tumour necrosis factor. Taken from (1).\nInnate (sometimes called natural) immunity includes the barrier functions and the cells involved in recognition of molecular patterns on microbes (these are called microbe-associated molecular patterns or MAMPs) and the subsequent destruction of those microbes. Examples of MAMPs include the cell wall lipopolysaccharides of Gram-negative bacteria and the peptidoglycans of Gram-positive bacteria. These general structural features are recognised by pattern recognition receptors; toll-like receptors are examples of pattern recognition receptors but there are many others. The typical response following recognition would be to engulf the microbe carrying the MAMP by the process of phagocytosis, with subsequent destruction of the microbe within lysosomes by the so-called respiratory burst which generates destructive reactive oxygen species. Neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells are all phagocytic cells. The inflammatory response is also triggered by this process, with the aim of creating an environment that is hostile to the invading microbes; in fact, an inflammatory response can be triggered by isolated MAMPs, not only by microbes bearing MAMPs. Note too that the inflammatory response can be damaging to the host if it is not properly controlled and m\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This report examined the effect of 100% fruit juice (considered a part of total fruit servings) and its replacement with whole fruits equivalents on nutrient intake and diet quality. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2013\u20132016 data (24-h dietary recall) from adults 19+ years (n = 10,112) were used to assess the diet quality and nutrient intakes and to isocalorically replace with 100% fruit juice intakes whole fruit equivalents in a modeling analysis. About 15.6% adults were 100% fruit juice consumers. Consumers had higher diet quality (10% higher Healthy Eating Index, HEI 2015 score), and higher intakes of energy, calcium, magnesium, potassium, vitamin C and vitamin D than non-consumers. Consumption of 100% fruit juice was also associated with lower risk of being overweight/obese (\u221222%) and having metabolic syndrome (\u221227%). Replacing 100% fruit juice with whole fruits equivalents did not affect nutrient intake except for a modest increase (+6.4%) in dietary fiber. Results show that 100% fruit juice intake was associated with better diet quality and higher nutrient intake. Replacement of 100% fruit juice intake with whole fruits equivalents had no significant effect on nutrients except for dietary fiber.\nKeywords: nutrients, healthy eating index, health risk factors, dietary modeling\nIncreased fruit and vegetable consumption are associated with a reduced risk of CVD, diabetes and stroke, and their low intake is linked with poor health and increased risk of chronic diseases [1,2,3,4,5]. Fruits and vegetables are important sources of a number of key nutrients, including K, Mg, dietary fiber, folate, and vitamins A and C, and an array of bioactive substances [1,6,7,8]. Due to their nutritional value, they are consistently recommended by public health authorities globally and increasing their consumption is an important public health goal [9]. Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2015\u20132020 (DGA) recommends consumption of fruits and vegetables as part of healthy eating pattern [1]. Two or more servings of fruits and three or more servings of vegetables per day are recommended by most nutritional guidelines [2]. Increasing the contribution of fruits to the diets of adults and children is also one of the key objectives of Healthy People 2020 [10]. Despite these recommendations, there is a huge gap between recommendations and consumption. In 2015, only 12.2% U.S. adults (9.2% male and 15.1% females) met fruit intake recommendations and 9.3% adults (7.6% male and 10.9% females) met vegetable intake recommendations [11].\nChooseMyPlate recommends that half of the food on a meal plate should be fruit and vegetables and adults should consume 1.5 to 2 cups equivalent fruit per day depending on age, gender, and physical activity [6]. The fruit requirement can be met by consuming fresh, frozen, or dried whole fruit, or 100% fruit juice. DGA and MyPlate indicated that one cup of 100% fruit juice can be considered as one cup serving from the Fruit Group and 100% fruit juice in moderation can be part of healthy eating patterns [1,6]. However, there is an ongoing scientific debate on the recommendations for 100% fruit juice intake, especially for children. Concerns have been raised that naturally occurring sugars in 100% fruit juices may cause weight gain similar to those of sugar-sweetened beverages, again especially in children [12,13,14], however, several studies concluded that 100% fruit juice was not associated with meaningful weight gain [14,15,16]. Several randomized controlled trials have also suggested a positive or null effect of 100% fruit juice on cardiometabolic risk factors and glucose control [17,18]. A few previous cross-sectional studies also reported that children and adults who consumed 100% fruit juice had better diet quality and nutrient intakes than non-consumers [19,20,21,22,23,24,25]. The main purpose of this study was to provide an updated evaluation of the association of 100% fruit juice consumption by consumption level and the effect of replacing 100% fruit juice with whole fruit equivalents on nutrient intake and diet quality using the most recent National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2013\u20132016 database. Secondary aim of this study was to evaluate the association of 100% fruit juice consumption with physiological markers of risk.\nThe NHANES is a cross-sectional survey of nationally-representative non-institutionalized civilian population conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on a continual basis to examine nutrition, diet and health relationship. The data are collected using a complex stratified multistage cluster sampling probability design via an in-home interview for demographic and basic health information, and a comprehensive diet and health examination in a mobile examination center. A detailed description of the subject recruitment, survey design, and data collection procedures are available online [26] and all data obtained from this study are publicly available at: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/. NHANES protocol was approved by the NCHS Ethics Review Board and all participants or proxies provided a signed written informed consent. This study was a secondary data analysis which lacked personal identifiers, therefore, did not require Institutional Review Board review.\nData from adults age 19+ years participating in NHANES 2013\u20132014, and 2015\u20132016 (n = 11,776) were used; however, those with unreliable data (n = 1461), primarily incomplete recalls, determined by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and pregnant or lactating females (n = 203) were excluded, and the final sample size was 10,112 adults.\nDietary intake data were obtained from in-person 24-h dietary recall interviews that were administered using an automated,\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",
