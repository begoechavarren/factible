    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nIt wasn't so long ago that AIDS was a guaranteed death sentence. And thanks to those confronting ads in the 80s, we all knew it. They weren't exactly subtle. In fact, they scared the hell out of us. But the shock tactics worked and the rate of HIV infection in Australia plummeted. We thought we had it under control that we were playing it safe. But guess what? The infection rate has shot up again. And surprisingly, it's now straight women who are among the most vulnerable. A stunning morning in Apollo Bay on Victoria's Great Ocean Road while many sleep in. Line up there, mate. A few of Australia's fittest are about to hit the sand and surf in a dayong sports festival. Yeah, I woke up feeling good this morning, alert. Um, and I've gone for a couple of little light jogs and the body's responding. So, um, yeah, should have a good good run this morning. Deanna Bleg is a true Iron woman. She's 41, but competes against athletes half her age. Making your way fast. There's no doubt Deanna is in amazing shape, and this is what she loves doing, racing and pushing her body to the limit. But what's not obvious is that she's living with a lifethreatening illness. and doctors once told her she had just months to live. You're super fit and you seem to be an absolute picture of health. Is that entirely the case? I am fit. I am healthy. However, I also carry the HIV virus. It was 16 years ago that Deanna contracted HIV from unprotected sex with a former boyfriend. It's a grim reality that Deanna lives with amid the challenges of daily life as a busy mom to 13-year-old Tier and a son who's just turned eight. Tell me about that moment when you found out. Nothing nothing can prepare you for the words the test result being positive. It took me a while to get my head around it cuz I felt very very ashamed. I just felt you idiot Diana. You know, how on earth do you let this this get into you? They don't know. They assume it's like Alarmingly, 1,000 Australians a year are now diagnosed with HIV, the deadly virus that can lead to AIDS. It's a disgusting disease in their eyes. That's almost double the rate of 10 years ago. Cuz I was infected from traveling overseas. And these women are proof the virus is no longer confined to a single group. I think for for all of us when we were first diagnosed that it shatters the the spirit and I think I guess all of us just felt so isolated so cut off. They're all women all HIV positive and like 98% of all new infection they contracted HIV through heterosexual sex. I mean HIV is something that has never crossed my mind until it happened. It was something that's never spoken about. That's something that's never put you as a heterosexual woman. Sarah is 24 years old and was diagnosed with HIV in 2008. So, what did you know in school about HIV? What were you taught about HIV? Nothing. You know, you you get told about pregnancy, you get told about other STI, but you know, when you're a young heterosexual couple, you're not thinking about HIV. It's like, you know, because that happens in Africa, not in Australia. Sarah always heeded the warnings. She wasn't an IV drug user and never took chances with casual sex. But like many people, once in a relationship, she believed she was safe. And because you were in this relationship, you didn't think there was a risk. No. You know, we're in a long-term relationship, so you know, we weren't practicing safe sex. Um, I went and got tested, came back positive and told him about it and yeah, he sort of thought that it was possibly him that had it first. How do you deal with medical advances mean HIV can now be managed with proper treatment, but it's a long hard road. Sarah faces a lifetime of powerful medication. Do you get mad? Yeah. Yeah. I think everyone that gets sick gets mad. you know, you don't want this to happen. And it's not just the virus Sarah must live with. It's also the prejudice, fear, and stigma that still surrounds HIV. The stigma is still enormous. It is. It is. I mean, how have you experienced that? I've had people tell me that I should just go die and that, you know, you serious? Yeah. just, you know, that, you know, that I'm disgusting and that, you know, I don't sort of deserve to be breathing the same air, you know, like, and that still happens today. And how do you handle that? Well, you got to let those people go. [Music] If such ignorance exists today, just imagine what it was like for Deanna back in the early ' 90s when she was diagnosed while on a backpacking tour around the world. When did you first know? What were the first signs? I had really huge fevers. Um, hot and cold, sweating massive like I just drenched my clothes. I knew something wasn't quite right. Over a period of about 6 weeks of time, I lost about 20 kilos of weight. Like I just dropped off 20 kilos. I just went to skin and bone in in no time. And um it just got to a stage. I went to the doctors. I said, \"Look, test me for everything.\" And that's when I also requested a HIV test. The news was bad. And within months, the virus had progressed to AIDS. Deiana was on a cocktail of toxic drugs, almost 30 pills a day that ravaged her body even more. At one point, she even considered giving up the fight. I remember discussing with with the counselor talk about euthanasia. Like I just thought, I don't want to die. I don't want to fade away. You explored that how to die. Yeah. Not that I I didn't want to kill myself, but at that time I didn't want my strong body to fade. Yeah. 30 years ago, if you were diagnosed with HIV, what was your fate? Uh 30 years ago, HIV was universally a death sentence and a pretty awful one at that. So this is where um Professor Sharon Leuen is Australia's leading HIV expert. She coordinates three research teams at Melbourne's Alfred Hospital, MES University, and the Bernett Viology Center. People with HIV are leading really, really improved, almost normal lives. They still have to take tablets every day and there's still side effects from the tablets. Last year, Sharon and her teams made a breakthrough. They found where HIV cells hide in the body. It was a needle in a haystack discovery. It's a really really clever virus on a whole lot of levels. Not only in its capacity to change all the time and evade the immune system and evade drugs, but this capacity to go to sleep in some cells and hide in these small pockets of the body. I'm just going to show you some of the cells. The discovery means better treatment, but now people with HIV are living far longer. The drugs themselves are creating a whole new raft of health issues. So we see a lot of heart disease for example, diabetes, lipid problems. Is the virus changing or is that a result of the medicine? It's the result of people um living longer with the virus. Deanna Bleg has lived 11 years longer than doctors predicted, but remarkable success stories like hers have created new problems. There's now a widely held perception that the battle against HIV has been won. One of the the fallouts from having such improved prognosis is that people aren't as scared of HIV as they were before. That's a dangerous complacency. It's still not a walk in the park. People have to be in regular medical care on treatment lifelong and there still are ongoing toxicities and complications from the treatment. And we've all had those darks, right? picked each other up. And a number of support groups now operate specifically for heterosexual women. Meeting other women, it was like, oh, you oh, you've got it, too. And oh, really here they can open up about their health, their problems, and their men. Relationships. I mean, they do work the long-term ones, but it's like getting to that point. It's Do you find it difficult having relationships now? Yeah. Yeah. because it is it's that whole negotiating, you know, like when to tell a partner, um, stuff like that. And yeah, I mean, that's just an absolute minefield that will take a while to learn how to negotiate through, I guess. Have you been able to get into a relationship? I've had short-term relationships, but again, then it's just my fear of infecting them, so it's generally me that sort of backs away. Many more personal challenges lie ahead for Sarah. Perhaps the biggest for HIV positive women is motherhood. To have her two children, Deanna knew there was a very slim chance the virus could be passed on. How do you conceive without, you know, putting your partner at risk? Uh, fortunately, um, we had a few options to work with and we decided to go natural. Um, two consenting adults aware of our, um, risks. Um, we spoke with our doctor and um, we conceived first go. So that was when low exposure, but and your partner wasn't infected. That's right. He was not infected. Oh, thanks, sweetie. And happily, neither were Tia and her brother. And from the start, Deanna's been open with them about her condition. How proud are you of mom? Um, really bad. She's my mom. I love her. Doesn't really matter. And the gold medalist Diana Blle. Diana once thought she had just months to live. Now the finish line is a long way off. I have also learned through life that you can never predict your future. Um but I believe all being well that I will live a long life and I will see my daughter reach well above 21. And you weren't meant to live to 30. That's right. Yeah. And 41 now. and feel amazing and just I celebrate each year. I just don't you know 40 fantastic bring on 50. But Sarah's just starting her life with HIV and at times it's a lonely confusing journey. I feel like it's branded across me but you know I know that I don't look like I've got HIV but who does look like they have they have HIV? If you had one message for young women about HIV, what would it be? HIV exists. It's real and it can happen to anyone. Just to be aware and be safe and smart cuz it could happen to you.

    "input_prompt": "Claim:\nThe infection rate of HIV in Australia has almost doubled in the last 10 years.\n\nArticle Title:\nHIV/AIDS in Australia - Wikipedia\n\nGoogle Search Snippet:\nThe new trend toward an increase in HIV infections prompted the government to indicate it was considering a return to highly visible advertising.\n\nFull Page Content:\nThe latest data on HIV diagnoses in Australia has confirmed a long-term trend.\nOver the last decade, HIV diagnoses in Australia have continued to follow a downward trend, according to new data released today by the Kirby Institute at UNSW Sydney.\nWhile there were 722 new HIV diagnoses reported nationally in 2023 \u2013 up from 553 in 2022 \u2013 the researchers still reported a lower number of annual cases compared to pre-pandemic levels, and a long-term trend of declining diagnoses.\n\u201cThe increase in 2023, compared to COVID pandemic years, is likely associated with the resumption of pre-COVID sexual behaviours, testing and the movement of people in and out of the country. However, encouragingly, new diagnoses are still lower than pre-pandemic levels, and there is no interruption to our long-term trend of decline,\u201d says Dr Skye McGregor, lead of the Surveillance Innovation Group at the Kirby Institute.\n\u201cAny increase in HIV cases is concerning, however we need to interpret a single year of data with caution, particularly in the context of COVID. Importantly, the long-term trends show a decline.\u201d\nAccording to the data released today, overall HIV diagnoses have reduced by 33 per cent over the last decade, with particularly significant reductions among Australian-born gay and bisexual men, where diagnoses have reduced by 64 per cent.\n\u201cThese long-term reductions tell us our strategies to eliminate HIV transmission \u2013 such as testing, HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and treatment \u2013 are working. With effective treatment, levels of HIV in the blood are so low they are undetectable, meaning HIV can\u2019t be transmitted to sexual partners. In other words, undetectable = untransmittable, or U=U. However, we also need to look carefully at the inequities revealed by the data and intensify our efforts to respond to HIV,\u201d Dr McGregor says.\nDespite overall declines in HIV diagnoses in Australia, there has been a slight increase over the past 10 years among the small number of people living with HIV acquired through heterosexual sex. There have also been increases among people born overseas.\n\u201cWhile these are only small increases, when viewed against a backdrop of declines overall, this highlights where we need to focus additional efforts over the next decade,\u201d says Dr McGregor.\n\u201cThe Minister for Health and Aged Care, Mark Butler, convened a National HIV Taskforce to respond to HIV and made recommendations around innovative new programs that can help reach these populations. It is fantastic that these programs are funded and it\u2019s important that they are implemented swiftly.\n\u201cIn particular, there is an urgent need for culturally appropriate health services and programs designed with communities to engage overseas-born people in HIV prevention, testing and care as early as possible.\u201d\nAs has been the case for many years, rates of HIV among sex workers and people who inject drugs remain exceptionally low in Australia, thanks to decades of successful peer education prevention strategies developed and delivered by affected communities, which need to be sustained to ensure these low rates are maintained.\n\u201cTesting is central to any HIV strategy and, encouragingly, the number of people tested for HIV increased in 2023 following considerable declines over the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d says Dr McGregor.\nHowever, last year more than a third of diagnoses were classified as late, which means the person diagnosed may have been living with HIV for four or more years without knowing their HIV status and may be experiencing HIV-related illness. Among heterosexual people diagnosed with HIV, more than half were diagnosed with late-stage HIV.\n\u201cThe number of late diagnoses is very concerning. We need to increase access to testing, treatment and prevention in a targeted and equitable way, to ensure those most in need can easily access services,\u201d says Dr McGregor.\n\u201cRegular sexual-health testing is important for anyone who has changed sexual partners or who hasn\u2019t used a condom. A blood test for syphilis and HIV should be part of your routine sexual health screen with your GP.\u201d\nWhile most new HIV diagnoses continue to be among gay and bisexual men, diagnoses among this group have reduced by 43 per cent over the past 10 years, showcasing the success of comprehensive approaches to HIV prevention within this population.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had tremendous success reducing HIV among gay and bisexual men in Australia, and in 2023, we saw record numbers of people prescribed PrEP for HIV prevention. However, when we look at the trends in overseas-born gay and bisexual men, we can see there is actually a small 4 per cent increase in diagnoses over the past 10 years,\u201d says Professor Andrew Grulich, head of the HIV Epidemiology and Prevention Program at the Kirby Institute.\n\u201cWe have the strategies and technologies to eliminate HIV transmission in Australia. But we need to make sure PrEP and other prevention strategies are reaching the populations that most need them, including gay and bisexual men who were born overseas.\u201d\nAccording to the \u2018Annual Report of Trends in Behaviour 2024\u2019 report, produced by the UNSW\u2019s Centre for Social Research in Health, there are inconsistencies in HIV prevention coverage among gay and bisexual men. While overall coverage is high, at 80.5 per cent in 2023, younger participants (<25 years), bisexual men, and participants living in suburban and regional areas being less likely to report PrEP use and more likely to report some risk of HIV transmission.\nProfessor Martin Holt from the Centre for Social Research in Health says: \u201cAddressing disparities in prevention access and use remains critical to increasing consistency in prevention coverage across the country and in different communities. By doing so, we can build on the success seen in some parts of the country and get closer to the goal of eliminating HIV transmission nationally.\u201d\nHIV diagnoses among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples remained stable, with 24 diagnoses\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

However, encouragingly, new diagnoses are still lower than pre-pandemic levels, and there is no interruption to our long-term trend of decline,\u201d says Dr Skye McGregor, lead of the Surveillance Innovation Group at the Kirby Institute.\n\u201cAny increase in HIV cases is concerning, however we need to interpret a single year of data with caution, particularly in the context of COVID. Importantly, the long-term trends show a decline.\u201d\nAccording to the data released today, overall HIV diagnoses have reduced by 33 per cent over the last decade, with particularly significant reductions among Australian-born gay and bisexual men, where diagnoses have reduced by 64 per cent.\n\u201cThese long-term reductions tell us our strategies to eliminate HIV transmission \u2013 such as testing, HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and treatment \u2013 are working. With effective treatment, levels of HIV in the blood are so low they are undetectable, meaning HIV can\u2019t be transmitted to sexual partners. In other words, undetectable = untransmittable, or U=U. However, we also need to look carefully at the inequities revealed by the data and intensify our efforts to respond to HIV,\u201d Dr McGregor says.\nDespite overall declines in HIV diagnoses in Australia, there has been a slight increase over the past 10 years among the small number of people living with HIV acquired through heterosexual sex. There have also been increases among people born overseas.\n\u201cWhile these are only small increases, when viewed against a backdrop of declines overall, this highlights where we need to focus additional efforts over the next decade,\u201d says Dr McGregor.\n\u201cThe Minister for Health and Aged Care, Mark Butler, convened a National HIV Taskforce to respond to HIV and made recommendations around innovative new programs that can help reach these populations. It is fantastic that these programs are funded and it\u2019s important that they are implemented swiftly.\n\u201cIn particular, there is an urgent need for culturally appropriate health services and programs designed with communities to engage overseas-born people in HIV prevention, testing and care as early as possible.\u201d\nAs has been the case for many years, rates of HIV among sex workers and people who inject drugs remain exceptionally low in Australia, thanks to decades of successful peer education prevention strategies developed and delivered by affected communities, which need to be sustained to ensure these low rates are maintained.\n\u201cTesting is central to any HIV strategy and, encouragingly, the number of people tested for HIV increased in 2023 following considerable declines over the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d says Dr McGregor.\nHowever, last year more than a third of diagnoses were classified as late, which means the person diagnosed may have been living with HIV for four or more years without knowing their HIV status and may be experiencing HIV-related illness. Among heterosexual people diagnosed with HIV, more than half were diagnosed with late-stage HIV.\n\u201cThe number of late diagnoses is very concerning. We need to increase access to testing, treatment and prevention in a targeted and equitable way, to ensure those most in need can easily access services,\u201d says Dr McGregor.\n\u201cRegular sexual-health testing is important for anyone who has changed sexual partners or who hasn\u2019t used a condom. A blood test for syphilis and HIV should be part of your routine sexual health screen with your GP.\u201d\nWhile most new HIV diagnoses continue to be among gay and bisexual men, diagnoses among this group have reduced by 43 per cent over the past 10 years, showcasing the success of comprehensive approaches to HIV prevention within this population.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had tremendous success reducing HIV among gay and bisexual men in Australia, and in 2023, we saw record numbers of people prescribed PrEP for HIV prevention. However, when we look at the trends in overseas-born gay and bisexual men, we can see there is actually a small 4 per cent increase in diagnoses over the past 10 years,\u201d says Professor Andrew Grulich, head of the HIV Epidemiology and Prevention Program at the Kirby Institute.\n\u201cWe have the strategies and technologies to eliminate HIV transmission in Australia. But we need to make sure PrEP and other prevention strategies are reaching the populations that most need them, including gay and bisexual men who were born overseas.\u201d\nAccording to the \u2018Annual Report of Trends in Behaviour 2024\u2019 report, produced by the UNSW\u2019s Centre for Social Research in Health, there are inconsistencies in HIV prevention coverage among gay and bisexual men. While overall coverage is high, at 80.5 per cent in 2023, younger participants (<25 years), bisexual men, and participants living in suburban and regional areas being less likely to report PrEP use and more likely to report some risk of HIV transmission.\nProfessor Martin Holt from the Centre for Social Research in Health says: \u201cAddressing disparities in prevention access and use remains critical to increasing consistency in prevention coverage across the country and in different communities. By doing so, we can build on the success seen in some parts of the country and get closer to the goal of eliminating HIV transmission nationally.\u201d\nHIV diagnoses among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples remained stable, with 24 diagnoses\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

But we need to make sure PrEP and other prevention strategies are reaching the populations that most need them, including gay and bisexual men who were born overseas.\u201d\nAccording to the \u2018Annual Report of Trends in Behaviour 2024\u2019 report, produced by the UNSW\u2019s Centre for Social Research in Health, there are inconsistencies in HIV prevention coverage among gay and bisexual men. While overall coverage is high, at 80.5 per cent in 2023, younger participants (<25 years), bisexual men, and participants living in suburban and regional areas being less likely to report PrEP use and more likely to report some risk of HIV transmission.\nProfessor Martin Holt from the Centre for Social Research in Health says: \u201cAddressing disparities in prevention access and use remains critical to increasing consistency in prevention coverage across the country and in different communities. By doing so, we can build on the success seen in some parts of the country and get closer to the goal of eliminating HIV transmission nationally.\u201d\nHIV diagnoses among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples remained stable, with 24 diagnoses\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

We used combinations of relevant keywords (ie HIV, AIDS, epidemic, prevention, elimination, ending, population) in Pub Med.

We compared geographical trends with corresponding trends in uptake of HIV prevention interventions including HIV testing, HIV treatment and pre-exposure prophylaxis.\nStatewide, between 2010 and 2022 there was a 51% decline in HIV notifications (56% in GBM). The decline in GBM was greatest in the parts of inner Sydney with the highest concentration of GBM (>20%), with an 88% decline, approaching the UNAIDS target of 90%. Areas with the lowest concentration of GBM (<5%) had only a 32% decline. Similarly, the uptake of HIV prevention was greatest in the parts of inner-Sydney with >20% prevalence of GBM. In this area, among HIV negative GBM who reported condomless sex, 91% reported HIV testing in the last year and 82% reported PrEP use. Among GBM living with HIV, more than 95% were receiving HIV treatment.

While Australia achieved the 90-90-90 targets in 2020 and saw declines in new HIV diagnoses during the COVID-19 crisis, achieving the more ambitious 95-95-95 targets will require increased efforts to diagnose people living with HIV earlier and immediately link them to ongoing care and treatment.\n\u201cAs Australia stays on course to become one of the first countries to virtually eliminate HIV, the science produced here has the potential to inform the global HIV response,\u201d said Charles Gilks, IAS 2023 Local Chair and Queensland Professorial Chair of BBVs and STIs at the University of Queensland, Australia. \u201cKey to our national success has been a focus on prevention and on equitable access to care for anyone at risk of HIV, a winning strategy we are proud to share with the world.\u201d\n\u201cAchieving the last mile of the virtual elimination of HIV in Australia will require additional interventions \u2013 including those specifically designed to reach women. While the gay, bi-sexual and men who have sex with men communities are very aware of the benefit of prevention tools like PrEP, the heterosexual community is pretty much oblivious. We need greater education \u2013 including as part of secondary school curricula \u2013 to raise awareness around how to prevent HIV, including new tools like long-acting injectable PrEP,\u201d said Heather Ellis, a woman living with HIV and communications and engagement coordinator for Positive Women Victoria, Australia\u2019s only fully funded community organisation supporting and advocating for women living with HIV.\nAbstract and session: Australia\u2019s progress towards ending HIV as a public health threat: trends in epidemiological metrics over 2004-2021, Progress towards HIV elimination: Are we there yet? (3538, Track C)\nUse of HIV prevention tools increasing among gay and bisexual men in Australia, but younger men are more vulnerable to acquiring HIV\nFrom 2017 to 2021, the percentage of gay and bisexual men in Australia reporting that they use effective HIV prevention tools increased from 69.8% to 75.1%, and HIV risk declined from 30.2% to 24.9%, influenced by rising PrEP use, according to a new study.\nPresented by Martin Holt of the University of New South Wales, the study was based on survey responses from more than 25,800 men with casual male partners. Participants under 25 reported the highest level of vulnerability to HIV acquisition, but were also the most likely to consistently use condoms (25.4% in 2021). Meanwhile, 25 to 44 year olds were most likely to use PrEP (39% in 2021), and 45 year olds were most likely to rely on undetectable HIV viral load, also known as \u201ctreatment as prevention\u201d (11.8% in 2021).\nThe study also found that during 2017 to 2021, the use of HIV prevention tools increased more in suburbs with more than 10% gay residents (73.4% to 88.3%) and less in suburbs with fewer than 10% gay residents (68.9% to 73.7%).\nResearchers concluded that encouraging the use of effective prevention tools, particularly among younger men, is necessary to further reduce HIV infections in Australia.\nAbstract and session: Increasing prevention coverage among Australian gay and bisexual men but elevated HIV risk among younger and bisexual men: analysis of national behavioural surveillance data 2017-21, Poster exhibition (1933, Track C)\nUse of event-driven PrEP tripled in Australia between 2019 and 2022\nUse of event-driven PrEP for HIV prevention tripled from 7.8% in 2019 \u2013 when it was first included in Austr\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",
