We look at the Earth from space and we measure it on the ground. And what we see is that the planet's climate is changing. The last years have been the warmest since modern record-keeping began. It's serious. Even a little change in temperature can have big effects. And we're seeing some of those effects now. Sea levels are rising. We're seeing more extreme events like heatwaves and heavy rainfall and wildfire. And we know that a lot of those effects are going to increase with more warming. These changes are impacting decisions that some people make every day, like a farmer thinking about what crops to grow or a homeowner thinking about flood risk. But there's hope. There are scientists at NASA and around the world that are researching this. We know more about our planet than we have ever before, and we learn more every day. So we know why climate is changing. We know that it's due to increasing greenhouse gases from human activity. We also have tools that can help us better understand and better prepare for future climate change. So we develop computer models that help us understand how much it might change in the future. And we're also developing technologies here at NASA and around the world that can help us limit future warming or respond to the warming that we're experiencing. So why does climate change matter? It's real. It's serious, and it's here. We Asked a NASA Scientist. NASA. A NASA 360 Production.",

    "input_prompt": "Claim:\nThe last years have been the warmest since modern record-keeping began.\n\nArticle Title:\nWorld of Change: Global Temperatures - NASA Science\n\nGoogle Search Snippet:\nThe past nine years have been the warmest years since modern recordkeeping began in 1880. As the maps show, global warming does not mean temperatures rise ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAir temperatures on Earth have been rising since the Industrial Revolution. While natural variability plays some part, the preponderance of evidence indicates that human activities\u2014particularly emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases\u2014are mostly responsible for making our planet warmer.\nAccording to an ongoing temperature analysis led by scientists at NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), the average global temperature on Earth has increased by at least 1.1\u00b0 Celsius (1.9\u00b0 Fahrenheit) since 1880. The majority of the warming has occurred since 1975, at a rate of roughly 0.15 to 0.20\u00b0C per decade.\nThe maps above show temperature anomalies in five-year increments since 1880. (Click on the arrow to run the animation.) These are not absolute temperatures, but changes from the norm for each area. The data reflect how much warmer or cooler each region was compared to a base period of 1951-1980. (The global mean surface air temperature for that period was 14\u00b0C (57\u00b0F), with an uncertainty of several tenths of a degree.)\nThe image below shows global temperature anomalies in 2022, which tied for the fifth warmest year on record. The past nine years have been the warmest years since modern recordkeeping began in 1880.\nAs the maps show, global warming does not mean temperatures rise everywhere at every time by same rate. Temperatures might rise 5 degrees in one region and drop 2 degrees in another. For instance, exceptionally cold winters in one place might be balanced by extremely warm winters in another part of the world. Generally, warming is greater over land than over the oceans because water is slower to absorb and release heat (thermal inertia). Warming may also differ substantially within specific land masses and ocean basins.\nIn the animation at the top of the page and in the bar chart below, the years from 1880 to 1939 tend to be cooler, then level off by the 1950s. Decades within the base period (1951-1980) do not appear particularly warm or cold because they are the standard against which other years are measured.\nThe leveling off of temperatures in the middle of the 20th century can be explained by natural variability and by the cooling effects of aerosols generated by factories, power plants, and motor vehicles in the years of rapid economic growth after World War II. Fossil fuel use also increased after the war (5 percent per year), boosting greenhouse gases. Cooling from aerosol pollution happened rapidly. In contrast, greenhouse gases accumulated slowly, but they remain in the atmosphere for a much longer time. According to former GISS director James Hansen, the strong warming trend of the past four decades likely reflects a shift from balanced aerosol and greenhouse gas effects on the atmosphere to a predominance of greenhouse gas effects after aerosols were curbed by pollution controls.\nWhy should we care about one or two degrees of global warming? After all, temperatures fluctuate by many degrees every day where we live.\nThe temperatures we experience locally and in short periods can fluctuate significantly due to predictable, cyclical events (night and day, summer and winter) and hard-to-predict wind and precipitation patterns. But the global temperature mainly depends on how much energy the planet receives from the Sun and how much it radiates back into space. The energy coming from the Sun fluctuates very little by year, while the amount of energy radiated by Earth is closely tied to the chemical composition of the atmosphere\u2014particularly the amount of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.\nA one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all of the oceans, the atmosphere, and the land masses by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age. A five-degree drop was enough to bury a large part of North America under a towering mass of ice 20,000 years ago.\nGlobal temperature records start around 1880 because observations did not sufficiently cover enough of the planet prior to that time. The line plot above shows yearly temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2020 as recorded by NASA, NOAA, the Berkeley Earth research group, the Met Office Hadley Centre (United Kingdom), and the Cowtan and Way analysis. Though there are minor variations from year to year, all five records show peaks and valleys in sync with each other. All show rapid warming in the past few decades, and all show the last decade as the warmest.\nThe NASA GISS team chose the period of 1951-1980 as its baseline largely because the U.S. National Weather Service uses a three-decade period to define \u201cnormal\u201d or average temperature. The GISS temperature analysis effort also began around 1980, so the most recent 30 years was 1951-1980. Their objective is to provide an estimate of temperature change that could be compared with predictions of global climate change in response to atmospheric carbon dioxide, aerosols, and changes in solar activity.\nNASA\u2019s temperature analyses incorporate surface temperature measurements from more than 20,000 weather stations, ship- and buoy-based observations of sea surface temperatures, and temperature measurements from Antarctic research stations. These in situ measurements are analyzed using an algorithm that considers the varied spacing of temperature stations around the globe and urban heat island effects.\nSubscribe to the Earth Observatory and get the Earth in your inbox.\nNASA's Earth Observatory brings you the Earth, every day, with in-depth stories and stunning imagery.\nExplore Earth Science\nEarth Science Data\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The ten warmest years in the 175-year record have all occurred during the last decade (2015\u20132024).

When these amounts are the same, Earth\u2019s average surface temperature remains steady. When they are out of balance, Earth cools or warms. Earth\u2019s average surface temperature has been rising because human-produced greenhouse gases are causing Earth to absorb more energy than it radiates back to space.\nGiven the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of added heat energy to raise Earth\u2019s average surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree-Fahrenheit (1-degree-Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1850-1900 in NOAA's record) might seem small, but it represents a significant increase in heat energy circulating through all parts of the Earth system, including the oceans, frozen landscapes, and the atmosphere.\nBeyond being an indicator of changes in Earth\u2019s energy balance, surface temperature matters because it controls many environmental and ecological processes that are important to humans and other life, including the water cycle (evaporation, clouds, surface water supplies, and precipitation), the carbon cycle, and the kinds of plants, animals, and other living things that can survive in different places on Earth.\nThe concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (55 degrees Celsius) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the \"average\" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget, which can only be directly measured from space.\nTo calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute temperature readings to temperature anomalies\u2014the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend.\nAcross inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and known physical relationships\u2014such as the way temperature decreases with altitude\u2014to estimate the missing values. Each value is then used to calculate a global-scale temperature anomaly. This process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in Earth's surface temperature over time. Read more about how the global surface temperature record is built in our Climate Data Primer.\nTemperature change has not been uniform across the planet, but more areas are warming than cooling. And the rate of warming has accelerated in recent decades. According to NOAA's 2024 Annual Climate Report the combined land and ocean temperature has warmed at an average rate of 0.11 degrees Fahrenheit (0.06 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1850 and more than three times that rate (0.36 degrees Fahrenheit, or 0.20 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1975.\nRecent rates of global warming (1994-2024, bottom) are larger than the longer-term average rates (1901-2024, top).

Earth\u2019s average surface temperature has been rising because human-produced greenhouse gases are causing Earth to absorb more energy than it radiates back to space.\nGiven the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of added heat energy to raise Earth\u2019s average surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree-Fahrenheit (1-degree-Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1850-1900 in NOAA's record) might seem small, but it represents a significant increase in heat energy circulating through all parts of the Earth system, including the oceans, frozen landscapes, and the atmosphere.\nBeyond being an indicator of changes in Earth\u2019s energy balance, surface temperature matters because it controls many environmental and ecological processes that are important to humans and other life, including the water cycle (evaporation, clouds, surface water supplies, and precipitation), the carbon cycle, and the kinds of plants, animals, and other living things that can survive in different places on Earth.\nThe concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (55 degrees Celsius) apart.

To speak of the \"average\" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget, which can only be directly measured from space.\nTo calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe.

The ice caps are melting, sea levels are already rising, and Hawai'i is feeling the impacts.\n\nFull Page Content:\nThis website is an ARCHIVED version of NOAA Climate.gov as of June 25, 2025. Content is not being updated or maintained, and some links may no longer work.\nSeasonal (3-month) sea level estimates from Church and White (2011) (light blue line) and University of Hawaii Fast Delivery sea level data (dark blue). The values are shown as change in sea level in millimeters compared to the 1993-2008 average. NOAA Climate.gov image based on analysis and data from Philip Thompson, University of Hawaii Sea Level Center.\nGlobal mean sea level has risen about 8\u20139 inches (21\u201324 centimeters) since 1880. The rising water level is mostly due to a combination of melt water from glaciers and ice sheets and thermal expansion of seawater as it warms. In 2023, global mean sea level was 101.4 millimeters (3.99 inches) above 1993 levels, making it the highest annual average in the satellite record (1993-present).\nIn some ocean basins, sea level has risen as much as 6-8 inches (15-20 centimeters) since the start of the satellite record. Regional differences exist because of natural variability in the strength of winds and ocean currents, which influence how much and where the deeper layers of the ocean store heat.\nThe global mean water level in the ocean rose by 0.14 inches (3.6 millimeters) per year from 2006\u20132015, which was 2.5 times the average rate of 0.06 inches (1.4 millimeters) per year throughout most of the twentieth century. By the end of the century, global mean sea level is likely to rise at least one foot (0.3 meters) above 2000 levels, even if greenhouse gas emissions follow a relatively low pathway in coming decades.\nBetween 1993 and 2023 mean sea level has risen across most of the world ocean (blue colors). In some ocean basins, sea level has risen 6-8 inches (15-20 centimeters). Rates of local sea level (dots) on the coast can be larger than the global average due to geological processes like ground settling or smaller than the global average due to processes like the centuries-long rebound of land masses from the loss of ice-age glaciers. Map by NOAA Climate.gov based on data provided by Philip Thompson, University of Hawaii.\nPast and future sea level rise at specific locations on land may be more or less than the global average due to local factors: ground settling, upstream flood control, erosion, regional ocean currents, and whether the land is still rebounding or resettling from the compressive weight of vanished Ice Age glaciers. In the United States, the fastest rates of sea level rise are occurring in the Gulf of America (formerly Gulf of Mexico) from the mouth of the Mississippi westward, followed by the mid-Atlantic. Only in Alaska and a few places in the Pacific Northwest are sea levels falling today, although that trend will reverse in the future if the world follows a pathway with high greenhouse gas emissions.\nIn the United States, almost 30 percent of the population lives in coastal areas, where sea level rise plays a role in flooding, shoreline erosion, and hazards from storms. Globally, 8 of the world\u2019s 10 largest cities are near a coast, according to the U.N. Atlas of the Oceans.\nSouth Beach, Miami on May 3, 2007. Photo by Flickr user James Williamor, via a Creative Commons license.\nIn urban settings along coastlines around the world, rising seas threaten infrastructure necessary for local jobs and regional industries. Roads, bridges, subways, water supplies, oil and gas wells, power plants, sewage treatment plants, landfills\u2014the list is practically endless\u2014are all at risk from sea level rise.\nHigher background water levels mean that deadly and destructive storm surges, such as those associated with Hurricane Katrina, \u201cSuperstorm\u201d Sandy, and Hurricane Michael, push farther inland than they once did. Higher sea level also means more frequent high-tide flooding, sometimes called \u201cnuisance flooding\u201d because it isn't generally deadly or dangerous, but it can be disruptive and expensive. (Explore past and future frequency of high-tide flooding at U.S. locations with the Climate Explorer, part of the U.S. Climate Resilience Toolkit.)\nNuisance flooding in Annapolis in 2012. Around the U.S., nuisance flooding has increased dramatically in the past 50 years. Photo by Amy McGovern.\nIn the natural world, rising sea level creates stress on coastal ecosystems that provide recreation, protection from storms, and habitat for fish and wildlife, including commercially valuable fisheries. As seas rise, saltwater is also contaminating freshwater aquifers, many of which sustain municipal and agricultural water supplies and natural ecosystems.\nGlobal warming is causing global mean sea level to rise in two ways. First, glaciers and ice sheets worldwide are melting and adding water to the ocean. Second, the volume of the ocean is expanding as the water warms. A third, much smaller contributor to sea level rise is a decline in the amount of liquid water on land\u2014aquifers, lakes and reservoirs, rivers, soil moisture. This shift of liquid water from land to ocean is largely due to people depleting ground water.\nPedersen Glacier, at Aialik Bay in Alaska\u2019s Kenai Mountains, in 1917 (left) and 2005 (right). In the early 20th century, the glacier met the water and calved icebergs into a marginal lake near the bay. By 2005, the glacier had retreated, leaving behind sediment allowed the lake to be transformed into a small grassland. Photos courtesy of Louis H. Pedersen (1917) and Bruce F. Molina (2005), obtained from the Glacier Photograph Collection, Boulder, Colorado USA: National Snow and Ice Data Center/World Data Center for Glaciology. Large images: 1917 | 2005\nFrom the 1970s up through the last decade or so, melting and heat expansion were contributing roughly equally to observed sea level rise. But the melting of mountain glaciers and ice sheets has accelerated:\nAs a result, the amount of sea level rise due to melting (with a small addition from groundwater transfer and other water storage shifts) from 20\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

While natural variability plays some part, the preponderance of evidence indicates that human activities\u2014particularly emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases\u2014are mostly responsible for making our planet warmer.\nAccording to an ongoing temperature analysis led by scientists at NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), the average global temperature on Earth has increased by at least 1.1\u00b0 Celsius (1.9\u00b0 Fahrenheit) since 1880. The majority of the warming has occurred since 1975, at a rate of roughly 0.15 to 0.20\u00b0C per decade.\nThe maps above show temperature anomalies in five-year increments since 1880. (Click on the arrow to run the animation.) These are not absolute temperatures, but changes from the norm for each area. The data reflect how much warmer or cooler each region was compared to a base period of 1951-1980. (The global mean surface air temperature for that period was 14\u00b0C (57\u00b0F), with an uncertainty of several tenths of a degree.)\nThe image below shows global temperature anomalies in 2022, which tied for the fifth warmest year on record. The past nine years have been the warmest years since modern recordkeeping began in 1880.\nAs the maps show, global warming does not mean temperatures rise everywhere at every time by same rate. Temperatures might rise 5 degrees in one region and drop 2 degrees in another. For instance, exceptionally cold winters in one place might be balanced by extremely warm winters in another part of the world. Generally, warming is greater over land than over the oceans because water is slower to absorb and release heat (thermal inertia). Warming may also differ substantially within specific land masses and ocean basins.\nIn the animation at the top of the page and in the bar chart below, the years from 1880 to 1939 tend to be cooler, then level off by the 1950s. Decades within the base period (1951-1980) do not appear particularly warm or cold because they are the standard against which other years are measured.\nThe leveling off of temperatures in the middle of the 20th century can be explained by natural variability and by the cooling effects of aerosols generated by factories, power plants, and motor vehicles in the years of rapid economic growth after World War II. Fossil fuel use also increased after the war (5 percent per year), boosting greenhouse gases. Cooling from aerosol pollution happened rapidly. In contrast, greenhouse gases accumulated slowly, but they remain in the atmosphere for a much longer time. According to former GISS director James Hansen, the strong warming trend of the past four decades likely reflects a shift from balanced aerosol and greenhouse gas effects on the atmosphere to a predominance of greenhouse gas effects after aerosols were curbed by pollution controls.\nWhy should we care about one or two degrees of global warming? After all, temperatures fluctuate by many degrees every day where we live.\nThe temperatures we experience locally and in short periods can fluctuate significantly due to predictable, cyclical events (night and day, summer and winter) and hard-to-predict wind and precipitation patterns. But the global temperature mainly depends on how much energy the planet receives from the Sun and how much it radiates back into space. The energy coming from the Sun fluctuates very little by year, while the amount of energy radiated by Earth is closely tied to the chemical composition of the atmosphere\u2014particularly the amount of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.\nA one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all of the oceans, the atmosphere, and the land masses by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age. A five-degree drop was enough to bury a large part of North America under a towering mass of ice 20,000 years ago.\nGlobal temperature records start around 1880 because observations did not sufficiently cover enough of the planet prior to that time. The line plot above shows yearly temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2020 as recorded by NASA, NOAA, the Berkeley Earth research group, the Met Office Hadley Centre (United Kingdom), and the Cowtan and Way analysis. Though there are minor variations from year to year, all five records show peaks and valleys in sync with each other. All show rapid warming in the past few decades, and all show the last decade as the warmest.\nThe NASA GISS team chose the period of 1951-1980 as its baseline largely because the U.S. National Weather Service uses a three-decade period to define \u201cnormal\u201d or average temperature. The GISS temperature analysis effort also began around 1980, so the most recent 30 years was 1951-1980. Their objective is to provide an estimate of temperature change that could be compared with predictions of global climate change in response to atmospheric carbon dioxide, aerosols, and changes in solar activity.\nNASA\u2019s temperature analyses incorporate surface temperature measurements from more than 20,000 weather stations, ship- and buoy-based observations of sea surface temperatures, and temperature measurements from Antarctic research stations.

Warming may also differ substantially within specific land masses and ocean basins.\nIn the animation at the top of the page and in the bar chart below, the years from 1880 to 1939 tend to be cooler, then level off by the 1950s. Decades within the base period (1951-1980) do not appear particularly warm or cold because they are the standard against which other years are measured.\nThe leveling off of temperatures in the middle of the 20th century can be explained by natural variability and by the cooling effects of aerosols generated by factories, power plants, and motor vehicles in the years of rapid economic growth after World War II. Fossil fuel use also increased after the war (5 percent per year), boosting greenhouse gases. Cooling from aerosol pollution happened rapidly. In contrast, greenhouse gases accumulated slowly, but they remain in the atmosphere for a much longer time. According to former GISS director James Hansen, the strong warming trend of the past four decades likely reflects a shift from balanced aerosol and greenhouse gas effects on the atmosphere to a predominance of greenhouse gas effects after aerosols were curbed by pollution controls.\nWhy should we care about one or two degrees of global warming? After all, temperatures fluctuate by many degrees every day where we live.\nThe temperatures we experience locally and in short periods can fluctuate significantly due to predictable, cyclical events (night and day, summer and winter) and hard-to-predict wind and precipitation patterns.

Blue bars indicate cooler-than-average years; red bars show warmer-than-average years. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Information.\nAccording to the annual report from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, 2024 was the warmest year since global records began in 1850. The global average surface temperature was 2.32 Fahrenheit (1.29 degrees Celsius) above the 20th-century average (57.0 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.9 degrees Celsius) and 2.63 degrees Fahrenheit (1.46 degrees Celsius) above the pre-industrial average (56.7 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.7 degrees Celsius), which NOAA defines as the period from 1850-1900.\nGlobal temperatures in 2024 were above the 1991-2020 average (red) across most of the planet. Yearly temperatures compared to the 20th-century average (bar chart) show that it has been 48 years since Earth had a cooler-than-average year. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe 2024 global temperature anomaly (anomaly means \u201cdifference from average\u201d) is 0.18 degrees F (0.10 degrees C) warmer than the previous record, set the year before, in 2023. The ten warmest years in the 175-year record have all occurred during the last decade (2015\u20132024). When the new century started in 2000, the first year to set a new high-temperature record was 2005. Now, 2005 is just the 13th-warmest year on record.\nOther 2024 rankings included...\nFor more regional details and 2024 climate statistics, see the 2024 Global Climate Report from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe global average surface temperature is an indicator of the state of Earth\u2019s energy balance: how much sunlight it absorbs minus how much heat it radiates back to space. When these amounts are the same, Earth\u2019s average surface temperature remains steady. When they are out of balance, Earth cools or warms. Earth\u2019s average surface temperature has been rising because human-produced greenhouse gases are causing Earth to absorb more energy than it radiates back to space.\nGiven the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of added heat energy to raise Earth\u2019s average surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree-Fahrenheit (1-degree-Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1850-1900 in NOAA's record) might seem small, but it represents a significant increase in heat energy circulating through all parts of the Earth system, including the oceans, frozen landscapes, and the atmosphere.\nBeyond being an indicator of changes in Earth\u2019s energy balance, surface temperature matters because it controls many environmental and ecological processes that are important to humans and other life, including the water cycle (evaporation, clouds, surface water supplies, and precipitation), the carbon cycle, and the kinds of plants, animals, and other living things that can survive in different places on Earth.\nThe concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (55 degrees Celsius) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the \"average\" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget, which can only be directly measured from space.\nTo calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute temperature readings to temperature anomalies\u2014the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend.\nAcross inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and known physical relationships\u2014such as the way temperature decreases with altitude\u2014to estimate the missing values. Each value is then used to calculate a global-scale temperature anomaly. This process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in Earth's surface temperature over time. Read more about how the global surface temperature record is built in our Climate Data Primer.\nTemperature change has not been uniform across the planet, but more areas are warming than cooling. And the rate of warming has accelerated in recent decades. According to NOAA's 2024 Annual Climate Report the combined land and ocean temperature has warmed at an average rate of 0.11 degrees Fahrenheit (0.06 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1850 and more than three times that rate (0.36 degrees Fahrenheit, or 0.20 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1975.\nRecent rates of global warming (1994-2024, bottom) are larger than the longer-term average rates (1901-2024, top). Places that have cooled are colored blue; places that have warmed are colored yellow, orange, or red. In the past three decades, many places in the Northern Hemisphere have warmed by 1 degree Fahrenheit or more per decade. Differences are most dramatic in the Arctic. With the decline of ice and snow, the Arctic reflects less incoming sunlight, which amplifies the rate of greenhouse-gas-driven warming. NOAA Climate.gov, based o\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Evidence-based decision-making needs to be informed by up-to-date and timely information on key indicators of the state of the climate system and of the human influence on the global climate system. However, successive IPCC reports are published at intervals of 5\u201310 years, creating potential for an information gap between report cycles.\nWe follow methods as close as possible to those used in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) Working Group One (WGI) report. We compile monitoring datasets to produce estimates for key climate indicators related to forcing of the climate system: emissions of greenhouse gases and short-lived climate forcers, greenhouse gas concentrations, radiative forcing, the Earth's energy imbalance, surface temperature changes, warming attributed to human activities, the remaining carbon budget, and estimates of global temperature extremes. The purpose of this effort, grounded in an open-data, open-science approach, is to make annually updated reliable global climate indicators available in the public domain (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11388387, Smith et al., 2024a). As they are traceable to IPCC report methods, they can be trusted by all parties involved in UNFCCC negotiations and help convey wider understanding of the latest knowledge of the climate system and its direction of travel.\nThe indicators show that, for the 2014\u20132023 decade average, observed warming was 1.19 [1.06 to 1.30] \u00b0C, of which 1.19 [1.0 to 1.4] \u00b0C was human-induced. For the single-year average, human-induced warming reached 1.31 [1.1 to 1.7] \u00b0C in 2023 relative to 1850\u20131900. The best estimate is below the 2023-observed warming record of 1.43 [1.32 to 1.53] \u00b0C, indicating a substantial contribution of internal variability in the 2023 record. Human-induced warming has been increasing at a rate that is unprecedented in the instrumental record, reaching 0.26 [0.2\u20130.4] \u00b0C per decade over 2014\u20132023. This high rate of warming is caused by a combination of net greenhouse gas emissions being at a persistent high of 53\u00b15.4 Gt CO2e yr\u22121 over the last decade, as well as reductions in the strength of aerosol cooling. Despite this, there is evidence that the rate of increase in CO2 emissions over the last decade has slowed compared to the 2000s, and depending on societal choices, a continued series of these annual updates over the critical 2020s decade could track a change of direction for some of the indicators presented here.\nThe IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) provided an assessment of human influence on key indicators of the state of climate grounded in data up to the year 2019 (IPCC, 2021a, Supplement Sect. S1). The next IPCC assessment report, AR7, is due towards the end of the decade. Given the speed of recent change, and the need for updated climate knowledge to inform evidence-based decision-making, the Indicators of Global Climate Change (IGCC) was initiated to provide policymakers with annual updates of the latest scientific understanding on the state of selected critical indicators of the climate system and of human influence.\nThis second annual update follows broadly the format of last year (Forster et al., 2023), focussing on indicators related to heating of the climate system, building from greenhouse gas emissions towards estimates of human-induced warming and the remaining carbon budget. Figure 1 presents an overview of the aspects assessed and their interlinkages from cause (emissions) through effect (changes in physical indicators) to climatic impact drivers. It also provides a visual roadmap as to the structure of remaining sections in this paper to guide the reader.\nFigure 1The flow chart of data production from emissions to human-induced warming and the remaining carbon budget, illustrating both the rationale and workflow within the paper production.\nDownload\nThe update is based on methodologies assessed by the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the physical science basis of climate change (Working Group One (WGI) report; IPCC, 2021a) as well as Chap. 2 of the WGIII report (Dhakal et al., 2022) and is aligned with the efforts initiated in AR6 to implement FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles for reproducibility and reusability (Pirani et al., 2022; Iturbide et al., 2022).

The total rise is equivalent to draining a quarter of Lake Superior into the ocean over the course of a year.\nThis NASA-led analysis is based on a sea level dataset featuring more than 30 years of satellite observations, starting with the U.S.-French TOPEX/Poseidon mission, which launched in 1992. The Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich mission, which launched in November 2020, is the latest in the series of satellites that have contributed to this sea level record.\nThe data shows that global average sea level has risen a total of about 4 inches (9.4 centimeters) since 1993. The rate of this increase has also accelerated, more than doubling from 0.07 inches (0.18 centimeters) per year in 1993 to the current rate of 0.17 inches (0.42 centimeters) per year.\n\u201cCurrent rates of acceleration mean that we are on track to add another 20 centimeters of global mean sea level by 2050, doubling the amount of change in the next three decades compared to the previous 100 years and increasing the frequency and impacts of floods across the world,\u201d said Nadya Vinogradova Shiffer, director for the NASA sea level change team and the ocean physics program in Washington.\nSeasonal Effects\nGlobal sea level saw a significant jump from 2022 to 2023 due mainly to a switch between La Ni\u00f1a and El Ni\u00f1o conditions. A mild La Ni\u00f1a from 2021 to 2022 resulted in a lower-than-expected rise in sea level that year. A strong El Ni\u00f1o developed in 2023, helping to boost the average amount of rise in sea surface height.\nLa Ni\u00f1a is characterized by cooler-than-normal ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. El Ni\u00f1o involves warmer-than-average ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific. Both periodic climate phenomena affect patterns of rainfall and snowfall as well as sea levels around the world.\n\u201cDuring La Ni\u00f1a, rain that normally falls in the ocean falls on the land instead, temporarily taking water out of the ocean and lowering sea levels,\u201d said Josh Willis, a sea level researcher at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \u201cIn El Ni\u00f1o years, a lot of the rain that normally falls on land ends up in the ocean, which raises sea levels temporarily.\u201d\nA Human Footprint\nSeasonal or periodic climate phenomena can affect global average sea level from year to year. But the underlying trend for more than three decades has been increasing ocean heights as a direct response to global warming due to the excessive heat trapped by greenhouse gases in Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\u201cLong-term datasets like this 30-year satellite record allow us to differentiate between short-term effects on sea level, like El Ni\u00f1o, and trends that let us know where sea level is heading,\u201d said Ben Hamlington, lead for NASA\u2019s sea level change team at JPL.\nThese multidecadal observations wouldn\u2019t be possible without ongoing international cooperation, as well as scientific and technical innovations by NASA and other space agencies. Specifically, radar altimeters have helped produce ever-more precise measurements of sea level around the world. To calculate ocean height, these instruments bounce microwave signals off the sea surface, recording the time the signal takes to travel from a satellite to Earth and back, as well as the strength of the return signal.\nThe researchers also periodically cross-check those sea level measurements against data from other sources. These include tide gauges, as well as satellite measurements of factors like atmospheric water vapor and Earth\u2019s gravity field that can affect the accuracy of sea level measurements. Using that information, the researchers recalibrated the 30-year dataset, resulting in updates to sea levels in some previous years. That includes a sea level rise increase of 0.08 inches (0.21 centimeters) from 2021 to 2022.\nWhen researchers combine space-based altimetry data of the oceans with more than a century of observations from surface-based sources, such as tide gauges, the information dramatically improves our understanding of how sea surface height is changing on a global scale. When these sea level measurements are combined with other information, including ocean temperature, ice loss, and land motion, scientists can decipher why and how seas are rising.\nSite Manager: Carmen Blackwood NASA Responsible Official: Doug Newman\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Data show 2023 was the warmest year since global records began ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments are the trusted source of scientific evidence for climate negotiations taking place under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Evidence-based decision-making needs to be informed by up-to-date and timely information on key indicators of the state of the climate system and of the human influence on the global climate system. However, successive IPCC reports are published at intervals of 5\u201310 years, creating potential for an information gap between report cycles.\nWe follow methods as close as possible to those used in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) Working Group One (WGI) report. We compile monitoring datasets to produce estimates for key climate indicators related to forcing of the climate system: emissions of greenhouse gases and short-lived climate forcers, greenhouse gas concentrations, radiative forcing, the Earth's energy imbalance, surface temperature changes, warming attributed to human activities, the remaining carbon budget, and estimates of global temperature extremes. The purpose of this effort, grounded in an open-data, open-science approach, is to make annually updated reliable global climate indicators available in the public domain (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11388387, Smith et al., 2024a). As they are traceable to IPCC report methods, they can be trusted by all parties involved in UNFCCC negotiations and help convey wider understanding of the latest knowledge of the climate system and its direction of travel.\nThe indicators show that, for the 2014\u20132023 decade average, observed warming was 1.19 [1.06 to 1.30] \u00b0C, of which 1.19 [1.0 to 1.4] \u00b0C was human-induced. For the single-year average, human-induced warming reached 1.31 [1.1 to 1.7] \u00b0C in 2023 relative to 1850\u20131900. The best estimate is below the 2023-observed warming record of 1.43 [1.32 to 1.53] \u00b0C, indicating a substantial contribution of internal variability in the 2023 record. Human-induced warming has been increasing at a rate that is unprecedented in the instrumental record, reaching 0.26 [0.2\u20130.4] \u00b0C per decade over 2014\u20132023. This high rate of warming is caused by a combination of net greenhouse gas emissions being at a persistent high of 53\u00b15.4 Gt CO2e yr\u22121 over the last decade, as well as reductions in the strength of aerosol cooling. Despite this, there is evidence that the rate of increase in CO2 emissions over the last decade has slowed compared to the 2000s, and depending on societal choices, a continued series of these annual updates over the critical 2020s decade could track a change of direction for some of the indicators presented here.\nThe IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) provided an assessment of human influence on key indicators of the state of climate grounded in data up to the year 2019 (IPCC, 2021a, Supplement Sect. S1). The next IPCC assessment report, AR7, is due towards the end of the decade. Given the speed of recent change, and the need for updated climate knowledge to inform evidence-based decision-making, the Indicators of Global Climate Change (IGCC) was initiated to provide policymakers with annual updates of the latest scientific understanding on the state of selected critical indicators of the climate system and of human influence.\nThis second annual update follows broadly the format of last year (Forster et al., 2023), focussing on indicators related to heating of the climate system, building from greenhouse gas emissions towards estimates of human-induced warming and the remaining carbon budget. Figure 1 presents an overview of the aspects assessed and their interlinkages from cause (emissions) through effect (changes in physical indicators) to climatic impact drivers. It also provides a visual roadmap as to the structure of remaining sections in this paper to guide the reader.\nFigure 1The flow chart of data production from emissions to human-induced warming and the remaining carbon budget, illustrating both the rationale and workflow within the paper production.\nDownload\nThe update is based on methodologies assessed by the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the physical science basis of climate change (Working Group One (WGI) report; IPCC, 2021a) as well as Chap. 2 of the WGIII report (Dhakal et al., 2022) and is aligned with the efforts initiated in AR6 to implement FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles for reproducibility and reusability (Pirani et al., 2022; Iturbide et al., 2022). IPCC reports make a much wider assessment of the science and methodologies \u2013 we do not attempt to reproduce the comprehensive nature of these IPCC assessments here. As such, we do not consider adopting fundamentally different approaches to AR6. Rather, our aim is to rigorously track both climate system change and evolving methodological improvements between IPCC report cycles, thereby achieving transparency and consistency in between successive reports.\nThe update is organised as follows: emissions (Sect. 2) and greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations (Sect. 3) are used to develop updated estimates of effective radiative forcing (Sect. 4). Earth's energy imbalance (Sect. 5) and observations of global surface temperature change (Sect. 6) are key global indicators of a warming world. The contributions to global surface temperature change from human and natural influences are formally attributed in Sect. 7, which tracks the level and rate of human-induced warming. Section 8 updates the remaining carbon budget to policy-relevant temperature thresholds. Section 9 gives an example of global-scale indicators associated with climate extremes of maximum land surface temperatures. An important purpose of the exercise is to make these indicators widely available and understood. Code and data availability is given in Sect. 10, and conclusions are presented in Sect. 11. Data are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11388387 (Smith et al., 2024a).\nHistoric emissions from human ac\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Lee, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory\nSea level rise is affecting coastal communities around the world, especially those like Honolulu, pictured, that are located on islands\nCredit: NOAA Teacher at Sea Program, NOAA Ship HI\u2019IALAKAI\nA long-term sea level dataset shows ocean surface heights continuing to rise at faster and faster rates over decades of observations.\nGlobal average sea level rose by about 0.3 inches (0.76 centimeters) from 2022 to 2023, a relatively large jump due mostly to a warming climate and the development of a strong El Ni\u00f1o. The total rise is equivalent to draining a quarter of Lake Superior into the ocean over the course of a year.\nThis NASA-led analysis is based on a sea level dataset featuring more than 30 years of satellite observations, starting with the U.S.-French TOPEX/Poseidon mission, which launched in 1992. The Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich mission, which launched in November 2020, is the latest in the series of satellites that have contributed to this sea level record.\nThe data shows that global average sea level has risen a total of about 4 inches (9.4 centimeters) since 1993. The rate of this increase has also accelerated, more than doubling from 0.07 inches (0.18 centimeters) per year in 1993 to the current rate of 0.17 inches (0.42 centimeters) per year.\n\u201cCurrent rates of acceleration mean that we are on track to add another 20 centimeters of global mean sea level by 2050, doubling the amount of change in the next three decades compared to the previous 100 years and increasing the frequency and impacts of floods across the world,\u201d said Nadya Vinogradova Shiffer, director for the NASA sea level change team and the ocean physics program in Washington.\nSeasonal Effects\nGlobal sea level saw a significant jump from 2022 to 2023 due mainly to a switch between La Ni\u00f1a and El Ni\u00f1o conditions. A mild La Ni\u00f1a from 2021 to 2022 resulted in a lower-than-expected rise in sea level that year. A strong El Ni\u00f1o developed in 2023, helping to boost the average amount of rise in sea surface height.\nLa Ni\u00f1a is characterized by cooler-than-normal ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. El Ni\u00f1o involves warmer-than-average ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific. Both periodic climate phenomena affect patterns of rainfall and snowfall as well as sea levels around the world.\n\u201cDuring La Ni\u00f1a, rain that normally falls in the ocean falls on the land instead, temporarily taking water out of the ocean and lowering sea levels,\u201d said Josh Willis, a sea level researcher at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \u201cIn El Ni\u00f1o years, a lot of the rain that normally falls on land ends up in the ocean, which raises sea levels temporarily.\u201d\nA Human Footprint\nSeasonal or periodic climate phenomena can affect global average sea level from year to year. But the underlying trend for more than three decades has been increasing ocean heights as a direct response to global warming due to the excessive heat trapped by greenhouse gases in Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\u201cLong-term datasets like this 30-year satellite record allow us to differentiate between short-term effects on sea level, like El Ni\u00f1o, and trends that let us know where sea level is heading,\u201d said Ben Hamlington, lead for NASA\u2019s sea level change team at JPL.\nThese multidecadal observations wouldn\u2019t be possible without ongoing international cooperation, as well as scientific and technical innovations by NASA and other space agencies. Specifically, radar altimeters have helped produce ever-more precise measurements of sea level around the world. To calculate ocean height, these instruments bounce microwave signals off the sea surface, recording the time the signal takes to travel from a satellite to Earth and back, as well as the strength of the return signal.\nThe researchers also periodically cross-check those sea level measurements against data from other sources. These include tide gauges, as well as satellite measurements of factors like atmospheric water vapor and Earth\u2019s gravity field that can affect the accuracy of sea level measurements. Using that information, the researchers recalibrated the 30-year dataset, resulting in updates to sea levels in some previous years. That includes a sea level rise increase of 0.08 inches (0.21 centimeters) from 2021 to 2022.\nWhen researchers combine space-based altimetry data of the oceans with more than a century of observations from surface-based sources, such as tide gauges, the information dramatically improves our understanding of how sea surface height is changing on a global scale. When these sea level measurements are combined with other information, including ocean temperature, ice loss, and land motion, scientists can decipher why and how seas are rising.\nSite Manager: Carmen Blackwood NASA Responsible Official: Doug Newman\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",
