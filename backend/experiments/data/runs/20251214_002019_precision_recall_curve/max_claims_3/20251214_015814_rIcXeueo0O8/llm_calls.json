Growth rates of CO2 have tripled since the 1960s, accelerating from an annual average increase of 0.8 ppm per year to 2.4 ppm per year in the decade from 2011 to 2020. From 2023 to 2024, the global average concentration of CO2 surged by 3.5 ppm, the largest increase since modern measurements started in 1957.\n\u201cThe heat trapped by CO2 and other greenhouse gases is turbo-charging our climate and leading to more extreme weather. Reducing emissions is therefore essential not just for our climate but also for our economic security and community well-being,\u201d said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Ko Barrett. Concentrations of methane and nitrous oxide \u2013 the second and third most important long-lived greenhouse gases related to human activities \u2013 have also risen to record levels. WMO released the annual greenhouse gas bulletin to provide authoritative scientific information for the UN Climate Change conference in November. The COP 30 meeting in Bel\u00e9m, Brazil, will seek to ramp up climate action. \u201cSustaining and expanding greenhouse gas monitoring are critical to support such efforts,\u201d said Oksana Tarasova, coordinator of the Greenhouse Gas Bulletin, which is one of WMO\u2019s flagship scientific reports and is now in its 21st issue.\nWhen the bulletin was first published in 2004, the annual average level of CO2 measured by WMO\u2019s Global Atmosphere Watch network of monitoring stations was 377.1 ppm. In 2024 it was 423.9 ppm.\nAbout half of the total CO2 emitted each year remains in the atmosphere and the rest is absorbed by Earth\u2019s land ecosystems and oceans. However, this storage is not permanent. As global temperature rises, the oceans absorb less CO2 because of decreased solubility at higher temperatures, whilst land sinks are impacted on a number of ways, including the potential for more persistent drought.\nThe likely reason for the record growth between 2023 and 2024 was a large contribution from wildfire emissions and a reduced uptake of CO2 by land and the ocean in 2024 \u2013 the warmest year on record, with a strong El Ni\u00f1o.\nDuring El Ni\u00f1o years, CO2 levels tend to rise because the efficiency of land carbon sinks is reduced by drier vegetation and forest fires \u2013 as was the case with exceptional drought and fires in the Amazon and southern Africa in 2024.\n\u201cThere is concern that terrestrial and ocean CO2 sinks are becoming less effective, which will increase the amount of CO2 that stays in the atmosphere, thereby accelerating global warming. Sustained and strengthened greenhouse gas monitoring is critical to understanding these loops,\u201d said Oksana Tarasova, a WMO senior scientific officer.\nToday\u2019s CO2 emissions to the atmosphere not only impact global climate today, but will do so for hundreds of years because of its long lifetime in the atmosphere.\nMethane accounts for about 16% of the warming effect on our climate by long-lived greenhouse gases and has a lifetime of about nine years. Approximately 40% of methane is emitted into the atmosphere by natural sources (for example, wetlands) which are sensitive to climate as well, and about 60% comes from anthropogenic sources such as cattle, rice farming, fossil fuel exploitation, landfills and biomass burning.\nThe globally averaged methane concentration in 2024 were 1942 parts per billion (ppb) \u2013 an increase of 166% above pre-industrial (before 1750) levels.\nNitrous oxide is the third most important long-lived greenhouse gas and comes from both natural sources and due to human activities such as biomass burning, fertilizer use and various industrial processes.\nThe globally averaged concentration reached 338.0 ppb in 2024, an increase of 25% over the pre-industrial level.\nThe WMO Global Atmosphere Watch Programme coordinates systematic observations and analysis of greenhouse gases and other atmospheric constituents. Greenhouse gas measurement data are archived and distributed by the World Data Centre for Greenhouse Gases (WDCGG) at the Japan Meteorological Agency.\nA separate and complementary Emissions Gap Report by UN Environment is scheduled for release on 4 November. The Emissions Gap report assesses the latest scientific studies on current and estimated future greenhouse gas emissions; they compare these with the emission levels permissible for the world to progress on a least-cost pathway to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. This difference between \u201cwhere we are likely to be and where we need to be\u201d is known as the emissions gap.\nThe World Meteorological Organization (WMO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for promoting international cooperation in atmospheric science and meteorology.\nWMO monitors weather, climate, and water resources and provides support to its Members in forecasting and disaster mitigation. The organization is committed to advancing scientific knowledge and improving public safety and well-being through its work.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Imagine these gases as a cozy blanket enveloping our planet, helping to maintain a warmer temperature than it would have otherwise. Greenhouse gases consist of carbon dioxide, methane, ozone, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons, and water vapor. Water vapor, which reacts to temperature changes, is referred to as a 'feedback', because it amplifies the effect of forces that initially caused the warming.\nScientists have determined that carbon dioxide plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability of Earth's atmosphere. If carbon dioxide were removed, the terrestrial greenhouse effect would collapse, and Earth's surface temperature would drop significantly, by approximately 33\u00b0C (59\u00b0F).\nGreenhouse gases are part of Earth's atmosphere. This is why Earth is often called the 'Goldilocks' planet \u2013 its conditions are just right, not too hot or too cold, allowing life to thrive. Part of what makes Earth so amenable is its natural greenhouse effect, which maintains an average temperature of 15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F) . However, in the last century, human activities, primarily from burning fossil fuels that have led to the release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, have disrupted Earth's energy balance. This has led to an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and ocean. The level of carbon dioxide in Earth\u2019s atmosphere has been rising consistently for decades and traps extra heat near Earth's surface, causing temperatures to rise.\nREAD MORE\nExplore Earth Science\nNASA's unique vantage point helps us inform solutions to enhance decision-making, improve livelihoods, and protect our planet.\nEarth Science Data\nFacts About Earth\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

These instruments provide the trained and experienced user the capability to determine if site personnel are exposed to airborne concentrations which exceed instantaneous exposure limits for specific hazardous air contaminants. Air quality monitors can be useful in identifying oxygen-deficient or oxygen-enriched atmospheres, immediately dangerous to life or health conditions, elevated levels of airborne contaminants, flammable atmospheres, and radioactive hazards. Direct reading instruments are particularly useful for identifying point source contamination or emissions such as gas leaks. Periodic monitoring of airborne levels with a real-time monitor is often critical, especially before and during work activities. Direct-reading instruments are useful for performing screening surveys to determine areas where additional evaluation is warranted.\nPIDs use a fan or a pump to draw air into the instrument's detector. A high energy ultraviolet (UV) light source ionize the chemicals in the airstream. The charged molecules are collected on a charged surface, which generates a current that is directly proportional to the concentration of the chemical in the air being sampled. The ionization potential (IP) describes the amount of energy needed to induce ionization in a particular chemical.\nPIDs are used for:\nSingle or dual gas monitors are available from Geotech which can monitor carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, and a variety of additional toxic gases. The sample concentration is displayed in ppm, percent oxygen or percent LEL (Lower Explosive Limit), as applicable.\nMulti-gas monitors incorporate separate sensors for oxygen, combustible atmosphere, and up to three toxic gases in the same handheld monitor.\nThese monitors may operate in passive (diffusive) mode, or in active mode, in which a pump module draws air across the sensors.\nMany flammable gas sensors do not provide reliable readings in an oxygen deficient atmosphere. Therefore, oxygen content must always be determined before taking combustible gas readings. Flammable gases and vapors are tested second for fire or explosion risk. Monitoring for toxicity is conducted last. This monitoring process is greatly simplified by using a multi-gas monitor containing sensors for oxygen, LEL, and the relevant toxic gases.\nThese units use a flame to ionize airborne contaminants. Once they are ionized, they can be detected and measured.\nFIDs are the most sensitive for saturated hydrocarbons (alkanes), unsaturated hydrocarbons (alkenes and alkynes), and aromatic hydrocarbons.\nAerosol photometers operate by detecting scattered light. The amount of light reaching the detector is proportional to the number of particles passing through the detection chamber. Also known as nephelometers, these instruments are used to monitor particulate matter such as dusts, smokes, mists, and fumes. They can be used for monitoring the respirable fraction of dust, and are small enough to use for personal exposure monitoring. Results are reported in \u03bcg/m3 or mg/m3.\nVelocity meters (hotwire anemometers) are handheld devices with an extendable wand probe used to measure air speed (velocity).

The concerned measurement methods and instrumentations are complex due to the weak spectral characteristics and very low concentration in volume mixtures of them in the atmosphere. This narrative review focuses on the fundamental and advanced concepts of almost all the in situ and satellite-based methods and instrumentations for measuring the gaseous and other air pollutants in the earth-atmosphere interaction. This paper discusses the literature of past and present developments in the measurement methods and instrumentations by highlighting their positive and negative feedbacks. The developing history (1970\u20132020) of space-borne instrumentations is indicated along with their techniques and capability to compute the concentration of the atmospheric pollutants for monitoring the air quality (air pollution) and climate in large (regional to global) scale. Several applications of the satellite instruments are described in terms of some important pollutant gases, most of which are known as ambient air pollutant. This study makes some recommendations to the readers so that they can utilize the measurement methods and instrumentations to estimate the important air pollutants such as NO2, SO3, O3, CO, and aerosols as well as for setting up future guidelines and air pollution control policies regarding the epidemiology and public health issues.\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12517-023-11410-4.\nKeywords: Atmospheric pollutant gases, Measurement methods, Satellite instruments, Air quality, Epidemiology, Policy makings\nAtmospheric pollutants such as NO2, O3, CO2, CO, HCHO, SO2, and aerosols (particulate matter, PM) are mostly responsible for air pollution and highly utilized for the environmental analysis in the list of trace gases (Loubet et al. 2020). To perform any analysis within the biogeochemical and environmental processes, the measurement of the pollutant gases is essential. Basically, atmospheric pollutant concentrations and fluxes can be defined as the number of moles/molecules or joules/watts of energy or micro/milli grams of molecular mass passing through a unit area/volume per unit time. In case of molecular concentrations, the common unit of measurement is parts per million (ppm) or parts per billion (ppb) of atmospheric trace gases. For the measurement of fluxes of trace gases, the used units are nano/micro moles per meter square per second (nmolm\u22122 s\u22121 or \u00b5molm\u22122 s\u22121), or milli/micro grams per meter square per second/day (\u00b5gm\u22122 s\u22121 or \u00b5gm\u22122d\u22121), where these units are inter-exchangeable among them based on the adopting methods (Terraglio et al. 1958; Colahan 2004; NSW 2021). So, the efficient measuring method and respective instrument with suitable unit is very important for the specific species determination in the atmosphere. In the planetary boundary layer, the fluxes of atmospheric trace gases and energy are very important because they are an integral component of the conservation of mass, i.e., the time rate of change of the atmospheric burden of different trace gases (Reifsnyder et al. 1991). Overall, the trace gas fluxes are the important metric of an ecosystem performance, which measures the mass balance of vegetation and soils, and the way of physiological responding to the environmental forces and stresses. The measurement of pollutant gases in flux based indices is complex but better results are attained in flux based calculations (Musselman et al. 2006). There is no single or simple sensor for measuring the fluxes of trace gases at desired time and space like the other atmospheric sensors that are readily available for measuring the state variable like temperature, humidity, and wind velocity (Baldocchi 2014; Rahman et al. 2019). The complexity of measurement is arisen due to the compound structure, weak spectral signature, very low concentration in volume mixtures, multi-scaled, hierarchal, sum of many non-linear feedback controls, and modulations of trace gases. So, there is no perfect methods and instrumentations for measuring the pollutant gases in the earth-atmosphere interaction but there are several potential scientific contributions in the method and instrumentation development in the world over last 60 years (Woodwell and Whittaker 1968). This paper is presenting the in situ and satellite-based measurement methods and instrumentation of air pollutant concentrations and exchange fluxes at the earth-atmosphere interaction.\nThe earth system is naturally complex for its formation thorough the interconnection of different components (land, atmosphere, oceans, rivers, trees, animals, and human activities) which results the measurement methods and instrumentations are facing uncertainties in estimating the atmospheric trace gases in real-time applications. The interaction between the earth and atmosphere is the prime interface that operating on the wide range of spatial\u2013temporal scales. The earth-atmosphere interaction is critically important for driving the earth system via mass, energy, momentum fluxes, and the biogeochemical processes, where the biogeochemical cycles are considerably constrained by the climate variability and atmospheric processes (Suni et al. 2015). An iconic diagram illustrated the earth-atmosphere interaction and their basic components as shown in Fig. 1. A number of direct and indirect methods have been utilized for measuring the atmospheric trace gases for different purposes, where the main purposes are- to evaluate the energy fluxes for understanding the local and regional climate conditions; to compute the low weighted molecules for observing the environmental situations such as the atmospheric pollutions; to detect the chemical parameters in lab experiments for other p\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

EPA researchers work to develop new sampling and analytical methodologies to improve characterization of ambient air quality.\nOn this page:\nThe Clean Air Act requires nationwide monitoring of the six criteria pollutants using only monitoring methods formally designated by EPA as either Federal Reference Methods (FRMs) or Federal Equivalent Methods (FEMs).\nBy Congressional mandate, EPA has the ongoing responsibility to review and evaluate formal written applications from instrument manufacturers for new candidate FRM and FEM samplers and analyzers. In addition, reviews are conducted for submitted modification requests regarding any proposed hardware, firmware and/or software changes to previously designated FRM and FEM samplers and analyzers. State, local, and tribal monitoring organizations require timely notification of these designation decisions and support during implementation and operation of approved FRM and FEM instruments to ensure the accuracy and validity of National Ambient Air Quality Standard compliance decisions made using the collected network data.\nEPA is also conducting research to develop new monitoring methods for criteria pollutant measurements. The methods are provided in the Federal Register Notices, semi-annual updates to the Ambient Monitoring Technology Information Center (AMTIC) List of Designated Reference and Equivalent Methods.\nSince the inception of EPA\u2019s research efforts in the emerging technology domain of air sensors, data quality from the low-cost market segment has been a leading issue of concern, not only with consumers, but also with the regulatory agencies tasked with fielding questions about the data from sensors. With a desire to be an active and productive stakeholder in advancing this domain, EPA researchers are providing unbiased evaluations of sensor performance and infrastructural support through efforts such as the development of performance targets and testing protocols.\nGiven the wide range of data quality performance in low-cost sensors, EPA researchers have embarked on an effort to develop performance targets for air sensors used for non-regulatory ambient monitoring. The goal in establishing performance targets is to define a threshold level of data quality to promote a systematic understanding of sensors measurements which maximizes high quality products and minimizes products that offer no value.\nEstablishing data quality performance targets entails determining a set of parameters to include that define performance (i.e., precision, bias, minimum detection levels, etc.), and setting a value for each parameter that establishes the quality level being sought. Learn more about air sensor research on the Air Sensor Toolbox web page.\nResearch is being conducted to develop, evaluate and implement methods for non-criteria air pollutants such as formaldehyde and other VOCs. Although some methods exist for these types of pollutants, the methods have known deficiencies. Research is being conducted to develop new methods to address the need to accurately and reliably measure these pollutants.\nOne area of research is to expand the application of Toxic Organic Method TO-15A. The method currently is used to measure a subset of the 97 VOCs included in the 189 hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) listed in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\nToxic Organic Method TO-15A was updated using best practices and lessons learned by users of Method TO-15. The newer method addresses and incorporates improvements in canister, sampling, preconcentration, and analytical instrumentation technology. This method focuses on the collection and analysis of VOCs in ambient air.\nEPA researchers are investigating the application of Method TO-15A for use in measuring the gas ethylene oxide (EtO). EtO is used in the chemical industry to make other chemicals, including ethylene glycol, which are used in manufacturing a variety of common products. EtO also is used to sterilize medical equipment and to fumigate spices. The goal is to develop a Supplement to Method TO-15A describing the optimum analytical measurement techniques for this hazardous air pollutant when collected in air samples in specially treated canisters.\nDetermination of Ethylene Oxide at Ultra Trace Concentrations in Ambient Air Using EPA Method TO-15A: Optimization of VOC Preconcentrator and GC-MS Analytical Method Parameters (pdf) (1.07 MB, May 2024)\nStandard Operating Procedure for Analysis of Volatile Organic Compounds in Whole Air Samples Using the Entech 7200A Preconcentrator and Agilent 8890/5977B Gas Chromatograph \u2013 Mass Selective Detector (pdf) (6.75 MB, August 24, 2023)\nDisclaimer: This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is NOT an official EPA method and has not been validated. It has been reviewed and approved internally by EPA to meet data quality objectives associated with the work in which it was used. Mention of trade names or commercial products does not constitute EPA endorsement or recommendation for use.\nResearch is underway to develop and evaluate spectroscopic methods to measure ambient formaldehyde concentrations in real time. Formaldehyde is a hazardous air pollutant that contributes to ozone and fine particulate matter. Current measurement methods use time-, resource-, and labor-intensive offline wet chemistry and have known issues with accuracy. Researchers are studying emerging real-time formaldehyde measurement technologies for their use in air quality regulation.\nMethod development is addressing fundamental issues for accurate measurements, including sampling methodology, assessment of interferences, and accurate calibration techniques.

Growth rates of CO2 have tripled since the 1960s, accelerating from an annual average increase of 0.8 ppm per year to 2.4 ppm per year in the decade from 2011 to 2020. From 2023 to 2024, the global average concentration of CO2 surged by 3.5 ppm, the largest increase since modern measurements started in 1957.\n\u201cThe heat trapped by CO2 and other greenhouse gases is turbo-charging our climate and leading to more extreme weather. Reducing emissions is therefore essential not just for our climate but also for our economic security and community well-being,\u201d said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Ko Barrett. Concentrations of methane and nitrous oxide \u2013 the second and third most important long-lived greenhouse gases related to human activities \u2013 have also risen to record levels. WMO released the annual greenhouse gas bulletin to provide authoritative scientific information for the UN Climate Change conference in November. The COP 30 meeting in Bel\u00e9m, Brazil, will seek to ramp up climate action. \u201cSustaining and expanding greenhouse gas monitoring are critical to support such efforts,\u201d said Oksana Tarasova, coordinator of the Greenhouse Gas Bulletin, which is one of WMO\u2019s flagship scientific reports and is now in its 21st issue.\nWhen the bulletin was first published in 2004, the annual average level of CO2 measured by WMO\u2019s Global Atmosphere Watch network of monitoring stations was 377.1 ppm. In 2024 it was 423.9 ppm.\nAbout half of the total CO2 emitted each year remains in the atmosphere and the rest is absorbed by Earth\u2019s land ecosystems and oceans. However, this storage is not permanent. As global temperature rises, the oceans absorb less CO2 because of decreased solubility at higher temperatures, whilst land sinks are impacted on a number of ways, including the potential for more persistent drought.\nThe likely reason for the record growth between 2023 and 2024 was a large contribution from wildfire emissions and a reduced uptake of CO2 by land and the ocean in 2024 \u2013 the warmest year on record, with a strong El Ni\u00f1o.\nDuring El Ni\u00f1o years, CO2 levels tend to rise because the efficiency of land carbon sinks is reduced by drier vegetation and forest fires \u2013 as was the case with exceptional drought and fires in the Amazon and southern Africa in 2024.\n\u201cThere is concern that terrestrial and ocean CO2 sinks are becoming less effective, which will increase the amount of CO2 that stays in the atmosphere, thereby accelerating global warming. Sustained and strengthened greenhouse gas monitoring is critical to understanding these loops,\u201d said Oksana Tarasova, a WMO senior scientific officer.\nToday\u2019s CO2 emissions to the atmosphere not only impact global climate today, but will do so for hundreds of years because of its long lifetime in the atmosphere.\nMethane accounts for about 16% of the warming effect on our climate by long-lived greenhouse gases and has a lifetime of about nine years. Approximately 40% of methane is emitted into the atmosphere by natural sources (for example, wetlands) which are sensitive to climate as well, and about 60% comes from anthropogenic sources such as cattle, rice farming, fossil fuel exploitation, landfills and biomass burning.\nThe globally averaged methane concentration in 2024 were 1942 parts per billion (ppb) \u2013 an increase of 166% above pre-industrial (before 1750) levels.\nNitrous oxide is the third most important long-lived greenhouse gas and comes from both natural sources and due to human activities such as biomass burning, fertilizer use and various industrial processes.\nThe globally averaged concentration reached 338.0 ppb in 2024, an increase of 25% over the pre-industrial level.\nThe WMO Global Atmosphere Watch Programme coordinates systematic observations and analysis of greenhouse gases and other atmospheric constituents. Greenhouse gas measurement data are archived and distributed by the World Data Centre for Greenhouse Gases (WDCGG) at the Japan Meteorological Agency.\nA separate and complementary Emissions Gap Report by UN Environment is scheduled for release on 4 November. The Emissions Gap report assesses the latest scientific studies on current and estimated future greenhouse gas emissions; they compare these with the emission levels permissible for the world to progress on a least-cost pathway to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. This difference between \u201cwhere we are likely to be and where we need to be\u201d is known as the emissions gap.\nThe World Meteorological Organization (WMO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for promoting international cooperation in atmospheric science and meteorology.\nWMO monitors weather, climate, and water resources and provides support to its Members in forecasting and disaster mitigation.

Approximately 40% of methane is emitted into the atmosphere by natural sources (for example, wetlands) which are sensitive to climate as well, and about 60% comes from anthropogenic sources such as cattle, rice farming, fossil fuel exploitation, landfills and biomass burning.\nThe globally averaged methane concentration in 2024 were 1942 parts per billion (ppb) \u2013 an increase of 166% above pre-industrial (before 1750) levels.\nNitrous oxide is the third most important long-lived greenhouse gas and comes from both natural sources and due to human activities such as biomass burning, fertilizer use and various industrial processes.\nThe globally averaged concentration reached 338.0 ppb in 2024, an increase of 25% over the pre-industrial level.\nThe WMO Global Atmosphere Watch Programme coordinates systematic observations and analysis of greenhouse gases and other atmospheric constituents.

They do this through a process ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nThe greenhouse effect is the process through which heat is trapped near Earth's surface by substances known as 'greenhouse gases.' Imagine these gases as a cozy blanket enveloping our planet, helping to maintain a warmer temperature than it would have otherwise. Greenhouse gases consist of carbon dioxide, methane, ozone, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons, and water vapor. Water vapor, which reacts to temperature changes, is referred to as a 'feedback', because it amplifies the effect of forces that initially caused the warming.\nScientists have determined that carbon dioxide plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability of Earth's atmosphere. If carbon dioxide were removed, the terrestrial greenhouse effect would collapse, and Earth's surface temperature would drop significantly, by approximately 33\u00b0C (59\u00b0F).\nGreenhouse gases are part of Earth's atmosphere. This is why Earth is often called the 'Goldilocks' planet \u2013 its conditions are just right, not too hot or too cold, allowing life to thrive. Part of what makes Earth so amenable is its natural greenhouse effect, which maintains an average temperature of 15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F) . However, in the last century, human activities, primarily from burning fossil fuels that have led to the release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, have disrupted Earth's energy balance. This has led to an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and ocean. The level of carbon dioxide in Earth\u2019s atmosphere has been rising consistently for decades and traps extra heat near Earth's surface, causing temperatures to rise.\nREAD MORE\nExplore Earth Science\nNASA's unique vantage point helps us inform solutions to enhance decision-making, improve livelihoods, and protect our planet.\nEarth Science Data\nFacts About Earth\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Growth rates of CO2 have tripled since the 1960s, accelerating from an annual average increase of 0.8 ppm per year to 2.4 ppm per year in the decade from 2011 to 2020. From 2023 to 2024, the global average concentration of CO2 surged by 3.5 ppm, the largest increase since modern measurements started in 1957.\n\u201cThe heat trapped by CO2 and other greenhouse gases is turbo-charging our climate and leading to more extreme weather.

In 2024 it was 423.9 ppm.\nAbout half of the total CO2 emitted each year remains in the atmosphere and the rest is absorbed by Earth\u2019s land ecosystems and oceans.

As global temperature rises, the oceans absorb less CO2 because of decreased solubility at higher temperatures, whilst land sinks are impacted on a number of ways, including the potential for more persistent drought.\nThe likely reason for the record growth between 2023 and 2024 was a large contribution from wildfire emissions and a reduced uptake of CO2 by land and the ocean in 2024 \u2013 the warmest year on record, with a strong El Ni\u00f1o.\nDuring El Ni\u00f1o years, CO2 levels tend to rise because the efficiency of land carbon sinks is reduced by drier vegetation and forest fires \u2013 as was the case with exceptional drought and fires in the Amazon and southern Africa in 2024.\n\u201cThere is concern that terrestrial and ocean CO2 sinks are becoming less effective, which will increase the amount of CO2 that stays in the atmosphere, thereby accelerating global warming. Sustained and strengthened greenhouse gas monitoring is critical to understanding these loops,\u201d said Oksana Tarasova, a WMO senior scientific officer.\nToday\u2019s CO2 emissions to the atmosphere not only impact global climate today, but will do so for hundreds of years because of its long lifetime in the atmosphere.\nMethane accounts for about 16% of the warming effect on our climate by long-lived greenhouse gases and has a lifetime of about nine years. Approximately 40% of methane is emitted into the atmosphere by natural sources (for example, wetlands) which are sensitive to climate as well, and about 60% comes from anthropogenic sources such as cattle, rice farming, fossil fuel exploitation, landfills and biomass burning.\nThe globally averaged methane concentration in 2024 were 1942 parts per billion (ppb) \u2013 an increase of 166% above pre-industrial (before 1750) levels.\nNitrous oxide is the third most important long-lived greenhouse gas and comes from both natural sources and due to human activities such as biomass burning, fertilizer use and various industrial processes.\nThe globally averaged concentration reached 338.0 ppb in 2024, an increase of 25% over the pre-industrial level.\nThe WMO Global Atmosphere Watch Programme coordinates systematic observations and analysis of greenhouse gases and other atmospheric constituents. Greenhouse gas measurement data are archived and distributed by the World Data Centre for Greenhouse Gases (WDCGG) at the Japan Meteorological Agency.\nA separate and complementary Emissions Gap Report by UN Environment is scheduled for release on 4 November. The Emissions Gap report assesses the latest scientific studies on current and estimated future greenhouse gas emissions; they compare these with the emission levels permissible for the world to progress on a least-cost pathway to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. This difference between \u201cwhere we are likely to be and where we need to be\u201d is known as the emissions gap.\nThe World Meteorological Organization (WMO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for promoting international cooperation in atmospheric science and meteorology.\nWMO monitors weather, climate, and water resources and provides support to its Members in forecasting and disaster mitigation.

Imagine these gases as a cozy blanket enveloping our planet, helping to maintain a warmer temperature than it would have otherwise. Greenhouse gases consist of carbon dioxide, methane, ozone, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons, and water vapor. Water vapor, which reacts to temperature changes, is referred to as a 'feedback', because it amplifies the effect of forces that initially caused the warming.\nScientists have determined that carbon dioxide plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability of Earth's atmosphere. If carbon dioxide were removed, the terrestrial greenhouse effect would collapse, and Earth's surface temperature would drop significantly, by approximately 33\u00b0C (59\u00b0F).\nGreenhouse gases are part of Earth's atmosphere. This is why Earth is often called the 'Goldilocks' planet \u2013 its conditions are just right, not too hot or too cold, allowing life to thrive. Part of what makes Earth so amenable is its natural greenhouse effect, which maintains an average temperature of 15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F) . However, in the last century, human activities, primarily from burning fossil fuels that have led to the release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, have disrupted Earth's energy balance. This has led to an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and ocean. The level of carbon dioxide in Earth\u2019s atmosphere has been rising consistently for decades and traps extra heat near Earth's surface, causing temperatures to rise.\nREAD MORE\nExplore Earth Science\nNASA's unique vantage point helps us inform solutions to enhance decision-making, improve livelihoods, and protect our planet.\nEarth Science Data\nFacts About Earth\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Levels are expected to remain high for many generations.\n\nFull Page Content:\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmosphere soared by a record amount to new highs in 2024, committing the planet to more long-term temperature increase, according to a new report from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).\nThe WMO Greenhouse Gas Bulletin said continued emissions of CO2 from human activities and an upsurge from wildfires were responsible, as well as reduced CO2 absorption by \u201csinks\u201d such as land ecosystems and the ocean \u2013 in what threatens to be a vicious climate cycle. Growth rates of CO2 have tripled since the 1960s, accelerating from an annual average increase of 0.8 ppm per year to 2.4 ppm per year in the decade from 2011 to 2020. From 2023 to 2024, the global average concentration of CO2 surged by 3.5 ppm, the largest increase since modern measurements started in 1957.\n\u201cThe heat trapped by CO2 and other greenhouse gases is turbo-charging our climate and leading to more extreme weather. Reducing emissions is therefore essential not just for our climate but also for our economic security and community well-being,\u201d said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Ko Barrett. Concentrations of methane and nitrous oxide \u2013 the second and third most important long-lived greenhouse gases related to human activities \u2013 have also risen to record levels. WMO released the annual greenhouse gas bulletin to provide authoritative scientific information for the UN Climate Change conference in November. The COP 30 meeting in Bel\u00e9m, Brazil, will seek to ramp up climate action. \u201cSustaining and expanding greenhouse gas monitoring are critical to support such efforts,\u201d said Oksana Tarasova, coordinator of the Greenhouse Gas Bulletin, which is one of WMO\u2019s flagship scientific reports and is now in its 21st issue.\nWhen the bulletin was first published in 2004, the annual average level of CO2 measured by WMO\u2019s Global Atmosphere Watch network of monitoring stations was 377.1 ppm. In 2024 it was 423.9 ppm.\nAbout half of the total CO2 emitted each year remains in the atmosphere and the rest is absorbed by Earth\u2019s land ecosystems and oceans. However, this storage is not permanent. As global temperature rises, the oceans absorb less CO2 because of decreased solubility at higher temperatures, whilst land sinks are impacted on a number of ways, including the potential for more persistent drought.\nThe likely reason for the record growth between 2023 and 2024 was a large contribution from wildfire emissions and a reduced uptake of CO2 by land and the ocean in 2024 \u2013 the warmest year on record, with a strong El Ni\u00f1o.\nDuring El Ni\u00f1o years, CO2 levels tend to rise because the efficiency of land carbon sinks is reduced by drier vegetation and forest fires \u2013 as was the case with exceptional drought and fires in the Amazon and southern Africa in 2024.\n\u201cThere is concern that terrestrial and ocean CO2 sinks are becoming less effective, which will increase the amount of CO2 that stays in the atmosphere, thereby accelerating global warming. Sustained and strengthened greenhouse gas monitoring is critical to understanding these loops,\u201d said Oksana Tarasova, a WMO senior scientific officer.\nToday\u2019s CO2 emissions to the atmosphere not only impact global climate today, but will do so for hundreds of years because of its long lifetime in the atmosphere.\nMethane accounts for about 16% of the warming effect on our climate by long-lived greenhouse gases and has a lifetime of about nine years. Approximately 40% of methane is emitted into the atmosphere by natural sources (for example, wetlands) which are sensitive to climate as well, and about 60% comes from anthropogenic sources such as cattle, rice farming, fossil fuel exploitation, landfills and biomass burning.\nThe globally averaged methane concentration in 2024 were 1942 parts per billion (ppb) \u2013 an increase of 166% above pre-industrial (before 1750) levels.\nNitrous oxide is the third most important long-lived greenhouse gas and comes from both natural sources and due to human activities such as biomass burning, fertilizer use and various industrial processes.\nThe globally averaged concentration reached 338.0 ppb in 2024, an increase of 25% over the pre-industrial level.\nThe WMO Global Atmosphere Watch Programme coordinates systematic observations and analysis of greenhouse gases and other atmospheric constituents. Greenhouse gas measurement data are archived and distributed by the World Data Centre for Greenhouse Gases (WDCGG) at the Japan Meteorological Agency.\nA separate and complementary Emissions Gap Report by UN Environment is scheduled for release on 4 November. The Emissions Gap report assesses the latest scientific studies on current and estimated future greenhouse gas emissions; they compare these with the emission levels permissible for the world to progress on a least-cost pathway to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. This difference between \u201cwhere we are likely to be and where we need to be\u201d is known as the emissions gap.\nThe World Meteorological Organization (WMO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for promoting international cooperation in atmospheric science and meteorology.\nWMO monitors weather, climate, and water resources and provides support to its Members in forecasting and disaster mitigation.

The narrow diameter and long length are designed to minimize the diffusive mixing occuring inside the tubing between sampling and analysis.\nThe AirCore, invented and patented by Pieter Tans, has been rigorously evaluated and has been shown to provide measurement precisions better or equal to silicate glass flasks for CO2 and CH4 in the following publication:\nKarion, A., Sweeney, C., Tans, P., and Newberger, T., AirCore: An Innovative Atmospheric Sampling System, Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology, Nov. 2010, doi: 10.1175/2010JTECHA1448.1.\nFor more information, contact Colm Sweeney.\nFirstly, the valves at either end of the stainless-steel tubing are purged and dried and then the tube is filled with a gas of known concentration (colored blue on above figure). This is called the \u2018fill gas\u2019. This both purges and dries the AirCore and prepares it for analysis later. Depending on the length of the tubing, this takes around 20 minutes. Running a fill gas through the tubing also allows the checking of faults and leaks. A second AirCore is purged, as flying two at the same time allows cross-checking of samples in case one AirCore develops a fault during flight.\nUpon ascent with a valve open on one end, the \u2018fill gas\u2019 evacuates the tube to the minimum ambient pressure encountered. When the AirCore has reached 95,000ft (30km), approximately 99% of the \u2018fill gas\u2019 has evacuated from the tube. At this point, monitoring sensors detect that the AirCore has reached peak height and a cutter is activated to sever the payload from the balloon.\nWhile descending, the tubing equalizes with ambient pressure, filling slowly with surrounding air (rainbow colors), first passing through a small magnesium perchlorate filled canister attached to the open valve to remove moisture.\nThe open valve closes when sensors detect that the AirCore has landed, sealing the tube and preserving the sample.\nThe sample is pushed through the tube by opening both ends and running through a continuous analyzer. The air recovered from position xsample in the tubing can be related directly to the ambient pressure during sampling (Pa, sample) by the relationship below, assuming constant temperature in the tubing:\nAnalyzing the second of the two AirCores flown allows for verification. Confidence in the samples collected will be shown by the analyzer read-outs for both AirCores being mostly identical.\nThe AirCore was validated by carrying it on-board a light aircraft along with flasks and a Picarro CRDS CO2/CH4 analyzer. The three systems pulled in air through their own separate inlet systems. Results show no overall bias with respect to flasks; 66% of offsets between the systems were within 0.3 ppm of CO2 and 5 ppb of CH4.\nOn September 10, 2011, NOAA and CIRES scientists and engineers teamed up with Edge of Space Sciences (www.eoss.org) to launch three separate balloons with AirCore payloads. The main objective of these launches was to determine the level of agreement between the trace gas profiles for the three AirCores, and whether any differences were due to real atmospheric variability or due to differences in the AirCore samplers. The balloons had different burst altitudes ranging from 25 to 30 km and varied in their descent locations by between 5 and 10 km. The AirCores themselves also varied in their coating material and overall size. The figures show the profiles for CO2, CH4, and CO, as measured post-flight with a Picarro 4-species analyzer (model G2401). The second objective of the launches was to demonstrate the capability of the AirCore to sample the full column of the atmosphere and obtain accurate and precise measurements that can be compared and used for validation of satellite products, such as CO2 column means retrieved from NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory.\nThis video produced in October 2017 shows the AirCore sampling system from preparation to analysis.\nThe AirCore Atmospheric Sampling System has continued to gain traction, and there are now organizations worldwide developing it further including, but not exclusively, in the UK (University of East Anglia), the Netherlands (University of Groningen), France (Laboratoire de M\u00e9t\u00e9orologie Dynamique) and Finland (Finnish Meteorological Institute).\nThe latest developmental step is to create an \u2018active\u2019 AirCore where, as opposed to passively sampling air from the equalizing of pressure, atmospheric air samples are collected using a pump to pull the air through the tube during flight. This opens up the possibility to sample atmospheric air in both vertical and horizontal planes. Such a system can be mounted on aircraft or UAV drones.

This instrument was designed for operation on uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) but has also flown on other platforms, such as the NSF/NCAR GV, the NASA DC-8, and the NASA ER-2 aircraft. I work on airborne field projects to study atmospheric composition, dynamics (transport), and climate processes. Besides field work, I am involved with instrument design, building, and maintenance; data analysis, archiving data, and publication of results; and coordination and collaboration with the Water Vapor and Ozone Division within the NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory (GML) as well as other colleagues in GML and the NOAA Chemical Sciences Laboratory.\nMy academic training was in the field of chemistry, and I received my Ph.D. in physical chemistry in 1989. I began work in atmospheric science as a postdoctoral researcher and scientist with Dr. James Anderson, working on water vapor, ozone, and stratospheric transport, primarily on a series of missions on the NASA ER-2 aircraft in the 1990\u2019s. After working as a research scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and as a Program Director for Atmospheric Chemistry at the National Science Foundation, I came to NOAA in 2009.\nSince then, I have participated in the HIPPO and ATom projects to study the distribution, chemistry, and transport of atmospheric trace gases over the Pacific ocean from the NSF GV aircraft and the Pacific and Atlantic with the NASA DC-8, respectively. From 2010-2014, I operated the UCATS instrument on the NASA/NOAA Global Hawk UAS from California and Guam during GloPac and the Airborne Tropical TRopopause EXperiment (ATTREX). Highlights of ATTREX include the use of trace gases to determine the origin and transport of air in the Tropical Tropopause Layer (TTL), and observations of ozone over the tropical Pacific. In 2019-2022, we rebuilt the UCATS instrument to measure a larger suite of gases, including chlorine- and bromine-containing compounds such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halon-1211, and flew it on the ER-2 aircraft over North America as part of the Dynamics and Chemistry of the Summer Stratosphere (DCOTSS) Mission. I am currently analyzing data from the mission to determine the chlorine and bromine budgets of the midlatitude lower stratosphere. In 2023, we participated in the NOAA Stratospheric Aerosol processes, Budget and Radiative Effects (SABRE) project in the Arctic winter, in order to better understand stratospheric aerosols and possible effects from natural and anthropogenic perturbations to aerosol distributions. Long-lived trace gases such as nitrous oxide (N2O) can help show whether air has been influenced by the Polar Vortex, and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is used to determine age of air; these are among the gases measured by UCATS. Analysis of SABRE data and preparation for future SABRE activities is ongoing, with plans for a deployment to the tropics in 2025.\nGlobal Monitoring Laboratory \u00bb U.S. Department of Commerce \u00bb National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration \u00bb NOAA Research\nPrivacy Policy | Accessibility | Disclaimer | Disclaimer for External Links | FOIA | Usa.gov\nSite Contents Contact Us | Webmaster Take Our Survey\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Greenhouse gases consist of carbon dioxide, methane, ozone, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons, and water vapor. Water vapor, which reacts to temperature changes, is referred to as a 'feedback', because it amplifies the effect of forces that initially caused the warming.\nScientists have determined that carbon dioxide plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability of Earth's atmosphere. If carbon dioxide were removed, the terrestrial greenhouse effect would collapse, and Earth's surface temperature would drop significantly, by approximately 33\u00b0C (59\u00b0F).\nGreenhouse gases are part of Earth's atmosphere. This is why Earth is often called the 'Goldilocks' planet \u2013 its conditions are just right, not too hot or too cold, allowing life to thrive. Part of what makes Earth so amenable is its natural greenhouse effect, which maintains an average temperature of 15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F) . However, in the last century, human activities, primarily from burning fossil fuels that have led to the release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, have disrupted Earth's energy balance. This has led to an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and ocean. The level of carbon dioxide in Earth\u2019s atmosphere has been rising consistently for decades and traps extra heat near Earth's surface, causing temperatures to rise.\nREAD MORE\nExplore Earth Science\nNASA's unique vantage point helps us inform solutions to enhance decision-making, improve livelihoods, and protect our planet.\nEarth Science Data\nFacts About Earth\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",
