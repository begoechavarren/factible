    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\naccording to this i have to say remarkable piece that you just put up late last night read it in bed at midnight that the fbi was organizing the riots of january 6th well yes it certainly suggests that possibility and i'm hearing from people that this is the most important and the darkest investigative piece they've seen in years but the american people deserve the truth about 1-6 not just for the sake of ashley babbitt not just for the sake of the hundreds of people held in prison unjustly as a violation of human rights but for the sake of the 70 plus million people who are trump supporters or just against the corrupt ruling class who have effectively been labeled de facto domestic extremists by our own government and i believe the key that unlocks the truth to 1-6 is the following question to what extent were the main militia groups imputed to the 1-6 so-called capital siege to what extent was their infiltration of those groups by undercover agents or informants and to what extent when we see the unindicted co-conspirators who occupy senior positions in those groups to what extent are those people being spared prosecution on account of a prior relationship with the federal government those two questions create a thread and when we pull that thread the ugly truth of that event and perhaps even the country we live in will be exposed i gotta ask because it it may answer one of the great mysteries is this i think there are 14 000 hours of unreleased video footage from that day the administration is hiding from us do you think this is why i think that's certainly a possibility um it's it's extremely suspicious even going back to this so-called pipe bomber video remember the pipe bomber the capital pipeliner the fbi has been extremely suspicious in withholding evidence video evidence that could help and identify this bomber which presumably they want to do but if you may i'd like to make a general point and it really after seeing all this you have to ask yourself does the national security apparatus do anything but conspire against the american people i'm led to conclude that we cannot have a democracy everything in our politics will be fake and performative until we bring the national security state including the fbi to heal it's not a left issue it's not a right issue every politician who cares about our country should demand a church committee 2.0 immediately and people of good faith on the left should join it uh immediately darren b i appreciate your coming on signing the work you do at revolver.news thank you",

As part of our ongoing investigation, we're releasing an updated video of the subject, which includes previously unreleased footage, higher quality video, and longer clips of the subject's movements.\nOn January 5th, 2021, between 7:30 and 8:30 p.m., an unidentified individual placed pipe bombs near the offices of the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee in Washington, D.C.

You can also submit tips online at tips.fbi.gov. The FBI's estimate is the suspect's height is approximately five-foot-seven inches tall. The suspect wore a face mask, a gray hooded sweatshirt, and black gloves. They used a backpack to transport each of the devices. They were wearing distinctive Nike Air Max Speed Turf shoes, which are black and gray with the yellow Nike logo. Fewer than 25,000 of these shoes were sold between August 2018 and January 2021.\nThe first time the suspect is seen is at approximately 7:34 p.m. at the intersection of First Street and North Carolina Avenue Southeast. The person walks southwest on North Carolina Avenue, turns north on New Jersey Avenue, west on D Street, and then south on South Capitol Street.\nThis footage of the suspect on South Capitol Street shows the person setting down their backpack, which is believed to contain one of the bombs at this time. The suspect appears to put on a pair of glasses and scan the area, standing on tiptoes. Before picking up the backpack, turning around, and heading back the way they came on South Capitol Street.\nAfter reaching the corner of D Street, the suspect turns around again and this time walks south all the way down South Capitol Street to a bench outside the Democratic National Committee headquarters building. Here we see the suspect sit on the bench for a few minutes. They do not place the bomb at this time.\nThe suspect then walks east on Ivy Street, turns north on New Jersey Avenue, and then pauses near the corner of D Street before retracing their steps back to the DNC bench, where the first bomb is placed.\nThis footage shows the suspect sitting on the DNC bench before placing the first bomb.\nHere we see the suspect placed the bomb at approximately 7:54 p.m. From there, the person walks north on South Capitol Street, east on D Street, south on New Jersey Avenue, northeast on North Carolina Avenue, when we lose video coverage of the suspect at approximately 8 p.m.\nEight minutes later, at about 8:08 p.m., we pick the suspect back up on camera heading north on Second Street. The suspect walks west on C Street, enters an alley that leads to Rumsey Court, and then walks west on Rumsey Court.\nThis footage shows the suspect passed between the RNC and the Capitol Hill Club, holding the backpack out to the side. The person continues between the RNC and the Capitol Hill Club, then continues north on First Street, east on C Street, back into the alley toward Rumsey Court, back onto Rumsey Court.\nThey place the second pipe bomb at approximately 8:16 p.m. The suspect then turns back onto Rumsey Court, walking east until the person is last seen on camera at approximately 8:18 p.m., wearing the backpack on their shoulders. The bomb is believed to have been placed shortly before this video, based on how the suspect is carrying the backpack.

The suspect wore a face mask, a gray hooded sweatshirt, and black gloves. They used a backpack to transport each of the devices. They were wearing distinctive Nike Air Max Speed Turf shoes, which are black and gray with the yellow Nike logo. Fewer than 25,000 of these shoes were sold between August 2018 and January 2021.\nThe first time the suspect is seen is at approximately 7:34 p.m. at the intersection of First Street and North Carolina Avenue Southeast. The person walks southwest on North Carolina Avenue, turns north on New Jersey Avenue, west on D Street, and then south on South Capitol Street.\nThis footage of the suspect on South Capitol Street shows the person setting down their backpack, which is believed to contain one of the bombs at this time. The suspect appears to put on a pair of glasses and scan the area, standing on tiptoes. Before picking up the backpack, turning around, and heading back the way they came on South Capitol Street.\nAfter reaching the corner of D Street, the suspect turns around again and this time walks south all the way down South Capitol Street to a bench outside the Democratic National Committee headquarters building. Here we see the suspect sit on the bench for a few minutes. They do not place the bomb at this time.\nThe suspect then walks east on Ivy Street, turns north on New Jersey Avenue, and then pauses near the corner of D Street before retracing their steps back to the DNC bench, where the first bomb is placed.\nThis footage shows the suspect sitting on the DNC bench before placing the first bomb.\nHere we see the suspect placed the bomb at approximately 7:54 p.m. From there, the person walks north on South Capitol Street, east on D Street, south on New Jersey Avenue, northeast on North Carolina Avenue, when we lose video coverage of the suspect at approximately 8 p.m.\nEight minutes later, at about 8:08 p.m., we pick the suspect back up on camera heading north on Second Street. The suspect walks west on C Street, enters an alley that leads to Rumsey Court, and then walks west on Rumsey Court.\nThis footage shows the suspect passed between the RNC and the Capitol Hill Club, holding the backpack out to the side. The person continues between the RNC and the Capitol Hill Club, then continues north on First Street, east on C Street, back into the alley toward Rumsey Court, back onto Rumsey Court.\nThey place the second pipe bomb at approximately 8:16 p.m. The suspect then turns back onto Rumsey Court, walking east until the person is last seen on camera at approximately 8:18 p.m., wearing the backpack on their shoulders. The bomb is believed to have been placed shortly before this video, based on how the suspect is carrying the backpack. We still believe there is someone out there who has information they may not have realized was significant until now.\nWe're asking you to come forward to share that information with the FBI.
