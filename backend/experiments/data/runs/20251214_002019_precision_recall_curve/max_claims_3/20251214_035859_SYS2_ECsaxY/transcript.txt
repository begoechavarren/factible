according to this i have to say remarkable piece that you just put up late last night read it in bed at midnight that the fbi was organizing the riots of january 6th well yes it certainly suggests that possibility and i'm hearing from people that this is the most important and the darkest investigative piece they've seen in years but the american people deserve the truth about 1-6 not just for the sake of ashley babbitt not just for the sake of the hundreds of people held in prison unjustly as a violation of human rights but for the sake of the 70 plus million people who are trump supporters or just against the corrupt ruling class who have effectively been labeled de facto domestic extremists by our own government and i believe the key that unlocks the truth to 1-6 is the following question to what extent were the main militia groups imputed to the 1-6 so-called capital siege to what extent was their infiltration of those groups by undercover agents or informants and to what extent when we see the unindicted co-conspirators who occupy senior positions in those groups to what extent are those people being spared prosecution on account of a prior relationship with the federal government those two questions create a thread and when we pull that thread the ugly truth of that event and perhaps even the country we live in will be exposed i gotta ask because it it may answer one of the great mysteries is this i think there are 14 000 hours of unreleased video footage from that day the administration is hiding from us do you think this is why i think that's certainly a possibility um it's it's extremely suspicious even going back to this so-called pipe bomber video remember the pipe bomber the capital pipeliner the fbi has been extremely suspicious in withholding evidence video evidence that could help and identify this bomber which presumably they want to do but if you may i'd like to make a general point and it really after seeing all this you have to ask yourself does the national security apparatus do anything but conspire against the american people i'm led to conclude that we cannot have a democracy everything in our politics will be fake and performative until we bring the national security state including the fbi to heal it's not a left issue it's not a right issue every politician who cares about our country should demand a church committee 2.0 immediately and people of good faith on the left should join it uh immediately darren b i appreciate your coming on signing the work you do at revolver.news thank you
