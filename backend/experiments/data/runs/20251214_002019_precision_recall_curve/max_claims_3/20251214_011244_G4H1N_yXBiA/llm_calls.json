Warmer temperatures mean more melt days. During summer, ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nClimate change is accelerating the melting of ice in Greenland at an alarming rate, with serious implications not only for the Arctic, but also for the global climate, including Europe. According to a study led by researchers at the University of Barcelona, extreme melting episodes - periods when large areas of snow and ice melt rapidly - have been about twice as frequent during summers in recent decades compared to the period 1950-1990. The paper, published in the American Meteorological Society's Journal of Climate, shows that the last decade has seen peak years of extreme melting in Greenland. For example, during the summer of 2012, 610 gigatonnes of ice (the equivalent of 244 million Olympic-size swimming pools) melted, and in 2019, 560 gigatonnes (224 million Olympic-size swimming pools) melted.\nThe study was carried out by the Antarctica, Arctic and Alpine (ANTALP) research group of the UB's Department of Geography. It was led by lecturers and researchers from the Faculty of Geography and History Josep Bonsoms and Marc Oliva, Juan Ignacio L\u00f3pez-Moreno, a researcher at the Pyrenean Institute of Ecology (IPE-CSIC), and Xavier Fettweis, from the University of Li\u00e8ge (Belgium).\nThe study has analysed extreme melt episodes in Greenland between 1950 and 2022. The results show meltwater loss figures that, on average, have reached about 300 gigatonnes per year - the equivalent of a volume of about 48 million Olympic-size swimming pools per year - between 1980 and 2010. In addition, about 40% of the melting episodes have been extreme in recent decades. This figure rises to 50% in the coldest areas in the north and northwest of the island. \"This loss of surface glacial melt must be added to that of other dynamic processes, such as the detachment of icebergs directly into the sea and the flow of glaciers into the ocean, both of which are accelerated by increased melting\", add the UB researchers.\nIce melting phenomena have been directly linked to global warming, with recent studies showing that the Arctic is warming at four times the global average rate due to increased greenhouse gases. The authors of the study explain that \"increased melting is closely related to episodes of extreme warmth caused by more frequent, warmer and wetter anticyclonic air masses from more northern latitudes\". \"These atmospheric patterns keep the air over Greenland stagnant during the summer, increase solar radiation and reduce the albedo (sunlight reflectance) of snow and ice, which further accelerates warming and melting\", they add.\nAccording to UB researchers, melting is occurring in higher areas of the ice cap, where no ice melt was previously observed between 1950 and 1990. This has created cracks and other structural changes in the ice sheet, and increases the risk of large blocks of ice breaking off into the ocean. \"International climate reports anticipate a significant increase in temperatures in the polar regions, which would accelerate the trend we have observed in this study\", the researchers add.\nA study by the University of Barcelona reveals that ice melting in Greenland has increased dramatically in recent decades, contributing to sea level rise and affecting global weather patterns\nFuture predictions and impacts in Europe Greenland's melting ice has global consequences, as it is a major contributor to sea level rise and it also affects atmospheric circulation patterns. According to the researchers, these alterations may also influence Europe's climate. \"These changes in temperature and precipitation patterns could impact on socio-economic activities, ecosystems and may contribute to increased climate extremes in nearby regions of the North Atlantic\", the experts note. In addition, the researchers also warn that projected climate scenarios indicate an increase in these episodes: \"This highlights the urgency of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate the impacts of climate change in the coming decades\", they conclude.\nView the study\nPlease note: Content is displayed as last posted by a PreventionWeb community member or editor.

Ales Krivec, Unsplash\nEarth\u2019s complex natural systems sustain all life. Biodiverse terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems also support human livelihoods and well-being.\nWhen human numbers were small, our impact on the environment was local. However, as the global population has expanded and technologies have evolved, pressure on nature has increased. Growing populations have converted forests and wetlands into farms and settlements. Human activities are driving large scale changes in terrestrial and aquatic environments through pollution, water withdrawals, the hunting and harvesting of organisms, and the movement of invasive species around the globe [1]. The sustained overuse of natural resources has caused unprecedented levels of environmental destruction, including the loss of ecosystems and biodiversity [2].\nOne overarching result of human overreach is climate change. Greenhouse gases emitted from land use, industry, and the escalating use of fossil fuels are elevating Earth\u2019s temperature faster than at any point since the dawn of civilization [3]. This warming is altering Earth\u2019s capacity to supply food and fresh water and to sustain human health and well-being [4]. Climate impacts such as weather extremes and wildfires are hitting harder and sooner than scientists anticipated even 10 years ago [4].\nWhile the global population is projected to grow substantially over coming decades, ecosystem degradation and climate change threaten human prospects. Limiting the impacts requires shrinking humanity\u2019s environmental footprint with a global shift toward renewable energy sources, sustainable land use practices, and responsible consumption patterns. Underlying this shift is the need to account for human populations responsibly by ensuring that family planning information and services are available to all who desire them.\nWhile it is impossible to put a price tag on a healthy planet, economists calculate that the value of the services provided each year by well-functioning terrestrial ecosystems is at least equivalent to the annual global gross domestic product (GDP) [5]. Thriving ecosystems produce oxygen, purify water, protect from storms, provide food, and regulate the climate.\nYet humanity has an extensive history of using Earth\u2019s life-sustaining natural resources unsustainably. The aggregate human demands on resources have exceeded the Earth\u2019s regenerative capacity since the 1970s. The Global Footprint Network notes that \u201cmore than 80% of the world\u2019s population lives in countries that are running ecological deficits, using more resources than what their ecosystems can regenerate,\u201d by \u201coverfishing, over-harvesting forests, and emitting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than forests can sequester\u201d [6]. The organization tallies that it takes a year for Earth to rebuild the resources people use in just seven months [7].\nFor most of human history, people had little effect on the global climate. The dawn of the industrial era signaled a turning point. Starting around 1750, growing and industrializing populations ramped up the burning of fossil fuels, emitting heat-trapping greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane into the atmosphere. Over the decades, the use of fossil fuels has increased, first with coal, then oil, and then natural gas. Meanwhile, the clearing of forests and other natural ecosystems for farming and development has released additional greenhouse gases while reducing nature\u2019s capacity for carbon absorption [8].\nSince the Industrial Revolution, humans have released enough greenhouse gases into the atmosphere to raise the average global temperature by 1.1\u00b0C (close to 2\u00b0F) [8]. Warming has increased more rapidly since the 1970s than at any point in modern history [8]. At the same time, the global population has more than doubled [9]. The effects of this warming vary by region and include longer wildfire seasons, melting glaciers and ice caps, and more extreme weather such as heatwaves, more powerful storms, and flooding. Climate scientists warn that global temperature increases of 1.5\u00b0C and beyond will have far more devastating effects, from more destructive storms and prolonged droughts to inundation of coastal areas from mounting sea-level rise [10]. The impacts are magnified with each additional degree of warming [8].\nGovernments around the world are working to avoid dangerous climate change. Nearly every country is party to the Paris Agreement Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which aims to hold the global temperature rise \u201cto well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursu[e] efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change\u201d [11].\nAt recent emissions rates, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that warming could reach 1.5\u00b0C (2.7\u00b0F) between 2030 and 2052 (see Figure 1) [10]. Climate scientists maintain that keeping warming from exceeding that level would require global greenhouse gas emissions to decrease by 8.7% each year between 2024 and 2030 [12]. Even keeping warming to 2\u00b0C would require emissions cuts of 5.3% each year [12]. Yet while some progress is being made to achieve national goals, global emissions have continued to rise [13].\nThe risks from climate change are multiplying. These changes will impact the world\u2019s population in many ways, but specifically in terms of the capacity to use and manage land, adapt to extreme weather events, produce food, and access fresh water [14]. Delaying action will only increase costs and leave more people vulnerable.\nFigure 1\nEconomic growth and population growth drive climate change, with economic growth taking on outsized importance since the \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Burning ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nClimate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. Such shifts can be natural, due to changes in the sun\u2019s activity or large volcanic eruptions. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.\nBurning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun\u2019s heat and raising temperatures.\nThe main greenhouse gases that are causing climate change include carbon dioxide and methane. These come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example. Clearing land and cutting down forests can also release carbon dioxide. Agriculture, oil and gas operations are major sources of methane emissions. Energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main sectors causing greenhouse gases.\nClimate scientists have showed that humans are responsible for virtually all global heating over the last 200 years. Human activities like the ones mentioned above are causing greenhouse gases that are warming the world faster than at any time in at least the last two thousand years.\nThe average temperature of the Earth\u2019s surface is now about 1.42\u00b0C warmer than it was in the late 1800s-prior to the industrial revolution-and warmer than at any time in the last 100,000 years. The last decade (2015-2024) was the warmest on record, and each of the last four decades has been warmer than any previous decade since 1850.\nMany people think that climate change mainly means warmer temperatures. But temperature rise is only the beginning of the story. Because the Earth is a system where everything is connected, changes in one area can influence changes in all others.\nThe consequences of climate change include, among others, intense droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice, catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.\nClimate change can affect our health, ability to grow food, housing, safety and work. Some of us are already more vulnerable to climate impacts, such as people living in small island nations and other developing countries. Conditions like sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion have advanced to the point where entire communities have had to relocate, while protracted droughts are putting people at risk of famine. In the future, the number of people displaced by weather-related events is expected to rise.\nIn a series of UN reports, thousands of scientists and government reviewers agreed that limiting global temperature rise to no more than 1.5\u00b0C would help us avoid the worst climate impacts and maintain a liveable climate. Yet policies currently in place point to up to 2.8\u00b0C of warming by the end of the century.\nThe emissions that cause climate change come from every part of the world and affect everyone, but some countries produce much more than others. The six biggest emitters (China, the United States of America, India, the European Union, the Russian Federation, and Indonesia) together account for more than half of all global greenhouse gas emissions. By contrast, the 45 least developed countries contribute only 3 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.\nEveryone must take climate action, but people and countries creating more of the problem have a greater responsibility to act first.\nMany climate change solutions can deliver economic benefits while improving our lives and protecting the environment. We also have global frameworks and agreements to guide progress, such as the Sustainable Development Goals, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. Three broad categories of action are: cutting emissions, adapting to climate impacts and financing required adjustments.\nSwitching energy systems from fossil fuels to renewables like solar or wind will reduce the emissions driving climate change. But we have to act now. While a growing number of countries is committing to net zero emissions by 2050, emissions must be cut in half by 2030 to keep warming below 1.5\u00b0C. Achieving this means huge declines in the use of coal, oil and gas: production and consumption of all fossil fuels need to be cut by at least 30 per cent by 2030 in order to prevent catastrophic levels of climate change.\nAdapting to climate consequences protects people, homes, businesses, livelihoods, infrastructure and natural ecosystems. It covers current impacts and those likely in the future. Adaptation will be required everywhere but must be prioritized now for the most vulnerable people with the fewest resources to cope with climate hazards. The rate of return can be high. Early warning systems for disasters, for instance, save lives and property, and can deliver benefits up to 10 times the initial cost.\nClimate action requires significant financial investments by governments and businesses. But climate inaction is vastly more expensive. One critical step is for developed countries to support developing countries so they can adapt and move towards greener economies.\nTo get familiar with some of the more technical terms used in connection with climate change, consult the Climate Dictionary.\nClimate change is a hot topic \u2013 with myths and falsehoods circulating widely.

In this chart, we see the growth of global emissions from the mid-18th century through to ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nIn the late 1950s, Roger Revelle, an American oceanographer based at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California began to ring the alarm bells over the amount of CO2 being emitted into the atmosphere. Revelle was very concerned about the greenhouse effect from this emission and was cautious because the carbon cycle was not then well understood. So, he decided that it would be wise to begin monitoring atmospheric concentrations of CO2. In the late 1950s, Revelle and a colleague, Charles Keeling, began monitoring atmospheric CO2 at an observatory on Mauna Loa, on the big island of Hawaii. Mauna Loa was chosen because its elevation and location away from industrial centers made it as close to a global signal as any other location. The record from Mauna Loa, one of the most classic plots in all of science, shown in the figure below, is a dramatic sign of global change that captured the attention of the whole world because it shows that this \"experiment\" we are conducting is apparently having a significant effect on the global carbon cycle. The climatological consequences of this change are potentially of great importance to the future of the global population. The CO2 concentration recently crossed the 400 ppm mark for the first time in millions of years! In 2025, the level has risen above 429 ppm (see CO2.Earth Webite (link is external) for most up to date estimate).\nAs the Mauna Loa record and others like it from around the world accumulated, a diverse group of scientists began to appreciate Revelle's concern that we really did not know too much about the global carbon cycle that ultimately regulates how much of our CO2 emissions stay in the atmosphere.\nThe importance of present-day changes in the carbon cycle, and the potential implications for climate change became much more apparent when scientists began to get results from studies of gas bubbles trapped in glacial ice. As we learned in Module 1, the bubbles are effectively samples of ancient atmospheres, and we can measure the concentration of CO2 and other trace gases like methane in these bubbles, and then by counting the annual layers preserved in glacial ice, we can date these atmospheric samples, providing a record of how CO2 changed over time in the past. The figure below shows the results of some of the ice core studies relevant for the recent past -- back to the year 900 A.D.\nThe striking feature of these data is that there is an exponential rise in atmospheric CO2 (and methane, another greenhouse gas) that connects with the more recent Mauna Loa record to produce a rather frightening trend. Also shown in the above figure is the record of fossil fuel emissions from around the world, which show a very similar exponential trend. Notice that these two data sets show an exponential rise that seems to begin at about the same time. What does this mean? Does it mean that there is a cause-and-effect relationship between emissions of CO2 and atmospheric CO2 levels? Although we should remember that science cannot prove things to be true beyond all doubt, it is highly likely that there is a cause-and-effect relationship -- it would be an extremely bizarre coincidence if the observed rise in atmospheric CO2 and the emissions of CO2 were unrelated.\nHow serious is our modification of the natural carbon cycle? Here, we need a slightly longer perspective from which to view our recent changes, so we return to the records from ice cores and look deeper and further back in time than we did in the figure we have been examining.\nIn addition to providing a record of the past concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, as we learned in Module 1, the ice cores also give us a temperature record. By studying the ratios of stable isotopes of oxygen that make up the glacial ice, we can estimate the temperature (in the region of the ice) at the time the snow fell (glacial ice is formed by the compression of snow as it gets buried to greater and greater depths). From these data, shown in the figure below, we can see the natural variations in atmospheric CO2 and temperature that have occurred over the past 160,000 years (160 kyr).\nIn fact, looking at this much longer span of time enables us to clearly see that the present CO2 concentration of the atmosphere is unprecedented in the last several hundreds of thousands of years. As geoscientists, we are interested in more than just the last few hundred kiloyears, and so we look back into the past using sediment cores retrieved from the deep sea. Geochemists studying these sediments have been able to reconstruct the approximate concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere and the sea surface temperature (SST).\nTo find atmospheric CO2 levels equivalent to the present, we have to go back 2.5 million years. This means that, to the extent that the state of the carbon cycle is closely linked to the condition of the global climate, we are pushing the system toward a climate that has not occurred any time within the last several million years -- not something to be taken lightly.\nThe farther back in time we go, the more difficult it is to figure out how CO2 concentrations have changed, but that has not stopped some from attempting:\nOne thing that is clear is that further back in time, CO2 levels have been much, much higher, and the average global temperatures have also been much higher. Why does the CO2 concentration change so much? This is a big question whose answer involves many factors, but consider two that are relevant to what we'll learn about in this module. Photosynthesis only started in the Silurian (S on the timescale in the figure above), and photosynthesis is a major sink or absorber of atmospheric CO2. Sea level was much higher during the two big peaks in CO2 \u2014 this leaves less room for photosynthesis and it also decreases the planet's albedo, making it warmer. A warmer ocean cannot absorb atmospheric CO2 and instead, it releases it to the atmosphere.\nIn conclusion, from this brief look at the re\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

These come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example. Clearing land and cutting down forests can also release carbon dioxide. Agriculture, oil and gas operations are major sources of methane emissions. Energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main sectors causing greenhouse gases.\nClimate scientists have showed that humans are responsible for virtually all global heating over the last 200 years. Human activities like the ones mentioned above are causing greenhouse gases that are warming the world faster than at any time in at least the last two thousand years.\nThe average temperature of the Earth\u2019s surface is now about 1.42\u00b0C warmer than it was in the late 1800s-prior to the industrial revolution-and warmer than at any time in the last 100,000 years. The last decade (2015-2024) was the warmest on record, and each of the last four decades has been warmer than any previous decade since 1850.\nMany people think that climate change mainly means warmer temperatures. But temperature rise is only the beginning of the story. Because the Earth is a system where everything is connected, changes in one area can influence changes in all others.\nThe consequences of climate change include, among others, intense droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice, catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.\nClimate change can affect our health, ability to grow food, housing, safety and work. Some of us are already more vulnerable to climate impacts, such as people living in small island nations and other developing countries. Conditions like sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion have advanced to the point where entire communities have had to relocate, while protracted droughts are putting people at risk of famine. In the future, the number of people displaced by weather-related events is expected to rise.\nIn a series of UN reports, thousands of scientists and government reviewers agreed that limiting global temperature rise to no more than 1.5\u00b0C would help us avoid the worst climate impacts and maintain a liveable climate. Yet policies currently in place point to up to 2.8\u00b0C of warming by the end of the century.\nThe emissions that cause climate change come from every part of the world and affect everyone, but some countries produce much more than others. The six biggest emitters (China, the United States of America, India, the European Union, the Russian Federation, and Indonesia) together account for more than half of all global greenhouse gas emissions. By contrast, the 45 least developed countries contribute only 3 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.\nEveryone must take climate action, but people and countries creating more of the problem have a greater responsibility to act first.\nMany climate change solutions can deliver economic benefits while improving our lives and protecting the environment. We also have global frameworks and agreements to guide progress, such as the Sustainable Development Goals, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. Three broad categories of action are: cutting emissions, adapting to climate impacts and financing required adjustments.\nSwitching energy systems from fossil fuels to renewables like solar or wind will reduce the emissions driving climate change. But we have to act now. While a growing number of countries is committing to net zero emissions by 2050, emissions must be cut in half by 2030 to keep warming below 1.5\u00b0C. Achieving this means huge declines in the use of coal, oil and gas: production and consumption of all fossil fuels need to be cut by at least 30 per cent by 2030 in order to prevent catastrophic levels of climate change.\nAdapting to climate consequences protects people, homes, businesses, livelihoods, infrastructure and natural ecosystems.

Human activity is the principal cause.\n\nFull Page Content:\nIn the late 1950s, Roger Revelle, an American oceanographer based at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California began to ring the alarm bells over the amount of CO2 being emitted into the atmosphere. Revelle was very concerned about the greenhouse effect from this emission and was cautious because the carbon cycle was not then well understood. So, he decided that it would be wise to begin monitoring atmospheric concentrations of CO2. In the late 1950s, Revelle and a colleague, Charles Keeling, began monitoring atmospheric CO2 at an observatory on Mauna Loa, on the big island of Hawaii. Mauna Loa was chosen because its elevation and location away from industrial centers made it as close to a global signal as any other location. The record from Mauna Loa, one of the most classic plots in all of science, shown in the figure below, is a dramatic sign of global change that captured the attention of the whole world because it shows that this \"experiment\" we are conducting is apparently having a significant effect on the global carbon cycle. The climatological consequences of this change are potentially of great importance to the future of the global population. The CO2 concentration recently crossed the 400 ppm mark for the first time in millions of years! In 2025, the level has risen above 429 ppm (see CO2.Earth Webite (link is external) for most up to date estimate).\nAs the Mauna Loa record and others like it from around the world accumulated, a diverse group of scientists began to appreciate Revelle's concern that we really did not know too much about the global carbon cycle that ultimately regulates how much of our CO2 emissions stay in the atmosphere.\nThe importance of present-day changes in the carbon cycle, and the potential implications for climate change became much more apparent when scientists began to get results from studies of gas bubbles trapped in glacial ice. As we learned in Module 1, the bubbles are effectively samples of ancient atmospheres, and we can measure the concentration of CO2 and other trace gases like methane in these bubbles, and then by counting the annual layers preserved in glacial ice, we can date these atmospheric samples, providing a record of how CO2 changed over time in the past. The figure below shows the results of some of the ice core studies relevant for the recent past -- back to the year 900 A.D.\nThe striking feature of these data is that there is an exponential rise in atmospheric CO2 (and methane, another greenhouse gas) that connects with the more recent Mauna Loa record to produce a rather frightening trend. Also shown in the above figure is the record of fossil fuel emissions from around the world, which show a very similar exponential trend. Notice that these two data sets show an exponential rise that seems to begin at about the same time. What does this mean? Does it mean that there is a cause-and-effect relationship between emissions of CO2 and atmospheric CO2 levels? Although we should remember that science cannot prove things to be true beyond all doubt, it is highly likely that there is a cause-and-effect relationship -- it would be an extremely bizarre coincidence if the observed rise in atmospheric CO2 and the emissions of CO2 were unrelated.\nHow serious is our modification of the natural carbon cycle? Here, we need a slightly longer perspective from which to view our recent changes, so we return to the records from ice cores and look deeper and further back in time than we did in the figure we have been examining.\nIn addition to providing a record of the past concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, as we learned in Module 1, the ice cores also give us a temperature record. By studying the ratios of stable isotopes of oxygen that make up the glacial ice, we can estimate the temperature (in the region of the ice) at the time the snow fell (glacial ice is formed by the compression of snow as it gets buried to greater and greater depths). From these data, shown in the figure below, we can see the natural variations in atmospheric CO2 and temperature that have occurred over the past 160,000 years (160 kyr).\nIn fact, looking at this much longer span of time enables us to clearly see that the present CO2 concentration of the atmosphere is unprecedented in the last several hundreds of thousands of years. As geoscientists, we are interested in more than just the last few hundred kiloyears, and so we look back into the past using sediment cores retrieved from the deep sea. Geochemists studying these sediments have been able to reconstruct the approximate concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere and the sea surface temperature (SST).\nTo find atmospheric CO2 levels equivalent to the present, we have to go back 2.5 million years. This means that, to the extent that the state of the carbon cycle is closely linked to the condition of the global climate, we are pushing the system toward a climate that has not occurred any time within the last several million years -- not something to be taken lightly.\nThe farther back in time we go, the more difficult it is to figure out how CO2 concentrations have changed, but that has not stopped some from attempting:\nOne thing that is clear is that further back in time, CO2 levels have been much, much higher, and the average global temperatures have also been much higher. Why does the CO2 concentration change so much? This is a big question whose answer involves many factors, but consider two that are relevant to what we'll learn about in this module. Photosynthesis only started in the Silurian (S on the timescale in the figure above), and photosynthesis is a major sink or absorber of atmospheric CO2. Sea level was much higher during the two big peaks in CO2 \u2014 this leaves less room for photosynthesis and it also decreases the planet's albedo, making it warmer. A warmer ocean cannot absorb atmospheric CO2 and instead, it releases it to the atmosphere.\nIn conclusion, from this brief look at the re\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

However, recent climate changes cannot be explained by natural causes alone.\nChanges in the earth\u2019s orbit and its axis of rotation have had a big impact on climate in the past. For example, the amount of summer sunshine on the Northern Hemisphere, which is affected by changes in the planet\u2019s orbit, appears to be the primary cause of past cycles of ice ages, in which the earth has experienced long periods of cold temperatures (ice ages), as well as shorter interglacial periods (periods between ice ages) of relatively warmer temperatures.1 At the coldest part of the last glacial period (or ice age), the average global temperature was about 11\u00b0F colder than it is today. At the peak of the last interglacial period, however, the average global temperature was at most 2\u00b0F warmer than it is today.2\nChanges in the sun\u2019s energy output can affect the intensity of the sunlight that reaches the earth\u2019s surface. While these changes can influence the earth\u2019s climate, solar variations have played little role in the climate changes observed in recent decades.3 Satellites have been measuring the amount of energy the earth receives from the sun since 1978. These measurements show no net increase in the sun\u2019s output, even as global surface temperatures have risen.4\nThe amount of sunlight that is absorbed or reflected by the planet depends on the earth\u2019s surface and atmosphere. Dark objects and surfaces, like the ocean, forests, and soil, tend to absorb more sunlight. Light-colored objects and surfaces, like snow and clouds, tend to reflect sunlight. About 70 percent of the sunlight that reaches the earth is absorbed.5 Natural changes in the earth\u2019s surface, like the melting of sea ice, have contributed to climate change in the past, often acting as feedbacks to other processes.\nVolcanoes have played a noticeable role in climate, and volcanic eruptions released large quantities of carbon dioxide in the distant past. Some explosive volcano eruptions can throw particles (e.g., SO2) into the upper atmosphere, where they can reflect enough sunlight back to space to cool the surface of the planet for several years.6 These particles are an example of cooling aerosols.\nVolcanic particles from a single eruption do not produce long-term climate change because they remain in the atmosphere for a much shorter time than greenhouse gases. In addition, human activities emit more than 100 times as much carbon dioxide as volcanoes each year.7\nOver the last several hundred thousand years, carbon dioxide levels varied in tandem with the glacial cycles. During warm interglacial periods, carbon dioxide levels were higher. During cool glacial periods, carbon dioxide levels were lower.8 The heating or cooling of the earth\u2019s surface and oceans can cause changes in the natural sources and sinks of these gases, and thus change greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.9 These changing concentrations have acted as a positive climate feedback, amplifying the temperature changes caused by long-term shifts in the earth\u2019s orbit.10\n1 National Academy of Sciences.

Such shifts can be natural, due to changes in the sun\u2019s activity or large volcanic eruptions. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.\nBurning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun\u2019s heat and raising temperatures.\nThe main greenhouse gases that are causing climate change include carbon dioxide and methane. These come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example. Clearing land and cutting down forests can also release carbon dioxide. Agriculture, oil and gas operations are major sources of methane emissions. Energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main sectors causing greenhouse gases.\nClimate scientists have showed that humans are responsible for virtually all global heating over the last 200 years. Human activities like the ones mentioned above are causing greenhouse gases that are warming the world faster than at any time in at least the last two thousand years.\nThe average temperature of the Earth\u2019s surface is now about 1.42\u00b0C warmer than it was in the late 1800s-prior to the industrial revolution-and warmer than at any time in the last 100,000 years. The last decade (2015-2024) was the warmest on record, and each of the last four decades has been warmer than any previous decade since 1850.\nMany people think that climate change mainly means warmer temperatures. But temperature rise is only the beginning of the story. Because the Earth is a system where everything is connected, changes in one area can influence changes in all others.\nThe consequences of climate change include, among others, intense droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice, catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.\nClimate change can affect our health, ability to grow food, housing, safety and work. Some of us are already more vulnerable to climate impacts, such as people living in small island nations and other developing countries.

Yet policies currently in place point to up to 2.8\u00b0C of warming by the end of the century.\nThe emissions that cause climate change come from every part of the world and affect everyone, but some countries produce much more than others. The six biggest emitters (China, the United States of America, India, the European Union, the Russian Federation, and Indonesia) together account for more than half of all global greenhouse gas emissions.

We also have global frameworks and agreements to guide progress, such as the Sustainable Development Goals, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. Three broad categories of action are: cutting emissions, adapting to climate impacts and financing required adjustments.\nSwitching energy systems from fossil fuels to renewables like solar or wind will reduce the emissions driving climate change. But we have to act now. While a growing number of countries is committing to net zero emissions by 2050, emissions must be cut in half by 2030 to keep warming below 1.5\u00b0C. Achieving this means huge declines in the use of coal, oil and gas: production and consumption of all fossil fuels need to be cut by at least 30 per cent by 2030 in order to prevent catastrophic levels of climate change.\nAdapting to climate consequences protects people, homes, businesses, livelihoods, infrastructure and natural ecosystems.

According to a study led by researchers at the University of Barcelona, extreme melting episodes - periods when large areas of snow and ice melt rapidly - have been about twice as frequent during summers in recent decades compared to the period 1950-1990. The paper, published in the American Meteorological Society's Journal of Climate, shows that the last decade has seen peak years of extreme melting in Greenland. For example, during the summer of 2012, 610 gigatonnes of ice (the equivalent of 244 million Olympic-size swimming pools) melted, and in 2019, 560 gigatonnes (224 million Olympic-size swimming pools) melted.\nThe study was carried out by the Antarctica, Arctic and Alpine (ANTALP) research group of the UB's Department of Geography. It was led by lecturers and researchers from the Faculty of Geography and History Josep Bonsoms and Marc Oliva, Juan Ignacio L\u00f3pez-Moreno, a researcher at the Pyrenean Institute of Ecology (IPE-CSIC), and Xavier Fettweis, from the University of Li\u00e8ge (Belgium).\nThe study has analysed extreme melt episodes in Greenland between 1950 and 2022. The results show meltwater loss figures that, on average, have reached about 300 gigatonnes per year - the equivalent of a volume of about 48 million Olympic-size swimming pools per year - between 1980 and 2010. In addition, about 40% of the melting episodes have been extreme in recent decades. This figure rises to 50% in the coldest areas in the north and northwest of the island. \"This loss of surface glacial melt must be added to that of other dynamic processes, such as the detachment of icebergs directly into the sea and the flow of glaciers into the ocean, both of which are accelerated by increased melting\", add the UB researchers.\nIce melting phenomena have been directly linked to global warming, with recent studies showing that the Arctic is warming at four times the global average rate due to increased greenhouse gases. The authors of the study explain that \"increased melting is closely related to episodes of extreme warmth caused by more frequent, warmer and wetter anticyclonic air masses from more northern latitudes\". \"These atmospheric patterns keep the air over Greenland stagnant during the summer, increase solar radiation and reduce the albedo (sunlight reflectance) of snow and ice, which further accelerates warming and melting\", they add.\nAccording to UB researchers, melting is occurring in higher areas of the ice cap, where no ice melt was previously observed between 1950 and 1990. This has created cracks and other structural changes in the ice sheet, and increases the risk of large blocks of ice breaking off into the ocean. \"International climate reports anticipate a significant increase in temperatures in the polar regions, which would accelerate the trend we have observed in this study\", the researchers add.\nA study by the University of Barcelona reveals that ice melting in Greenland has increased dramatically in recent decades, contributing to sea level rise and affecting global weather patterns\nFuture predictions and impacts in Europe Greenland's melting ice has global consequences, as it is a major contributor to sea level rise and it also affects atmospheric circulation patterns. According to the researchers, these alterations may also influence Europe's climate. \"These changes in temperature and precipitation patterns could impact on socio-economic activities, ecosystems and may contribute to increased climate extremes in nearby regions of the North Atlantic\", the experts note. In addition, the researchers also warn that projected climate scenarios indicate an increase in these episodes: \"This highlights the urgency of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate the impacts of climate change in the coming decades\", they conclude.\nView the study\nPlease note: Content is displayed as last posted by a PreventionWeb community member or editor.

The Greenland Ice Sheet is the largest ice mass in the Northern Hemisphere. It lies from 71\u00b0N northwards, between the Atlantic and the Arctic Ocean [1]. Almost 80% of Greenland\u2019s landmass is covered by the ice sheet, expanding an area over 1.7 million km2. The ice from the centre flows through a series of drainage networks with both outlet glaciers and ice streams, all flowing towards the ocean, with some ending in glacial ice tongues [2].\nUnlike Antarctica, which has almost 75% of its coastline dominated by floating ice shelves, Greenland has only ice tongues. They are fewer in number and are constrained to fjords [3].\nOver the past few years, there has been an increase in the understanding on the topography beneath the ice sheet from the development of BedMachine v3 [4]. This was created using a series of remote sensing techniques and bathymetric data from the surrounding oceans. This dataset has now allowed the visualisation and quantification of the volume of ice present on the ice sheet, the bed topography, and the thickness of ice. BedMachine has showed that Greenland\u2019s topography has a saucerlike basin in the centre, with much of it at, or below current sea levels [1,4].\nThe data from BedMachine has shows that some of the central parts of the ice sheet has an ice thickness average of >3000 m. This understanding has enabled the calculation of the global sea level rise potential of the Greenland Ice Sheet. This is now calculated to be 7.4 m [2,4]. This means that if all the ice in Greenland melted, global sea levels would rise by 7.4 m on average globally.\nIce sheets play an integral role in the global climate system, thus it is important to understand how they have responded in the past. This better prepares us for future changes to both the climate, and global sea level rise [5,6].\nDuring the Quaternary Period (last 2.6 Ma), the Greenland Ice Sheet was one of a series of ice sheets dominating the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes. This included an ice sheet over North America (the Laurentide Ice Sheet) and over Europe, including Britain (the Eurasian Ice Sheet). The Greenland Ice Sheet held an additional 4.1 m sea level equivalent of ice during the global Last Glacial Maximum [10].\nHowever, since start of the current interglacial period, around 11,700 years ago, the Greenland Ice Sheet is the only one to remain. During these glacial periods, the Greenland Ice Shelf was larger than its present extent, whereas in past interglacials, evidence shows that Greenland had significantly less ice than its present day distribution [7].\nOver recent decades, the increase in air and ocean temperatures has resulted in the mass loss of ice through iceberg calving, meltwater runoff, and ocean-driven melting, all contributing a negative surface mass balance [2,5]. The figure here demonstrates that over the recent years, Greenland\u2019s melting season has fallen well below the 1981-2020 mean with most of the melt occurring in the Northern Hemisphere summer [1].\nThis loss of ice from the Greenland Ice Sheet is directly influencing the global mean sea level. Current observations show that it is raising global sea levels by ~0.69 mm yr-1 [5] which is greater than the contribution from the Antarctic ice sheets combined [5]. Satellite measurements from the early 1990s to 2018 recorded a mass loss of 3800 \u00b1 339 billion tonnes of ice, altogether, contributed 10.6 \u00b1 0.9 mm to global sea levels.\nA large proportion of ice loss from this ice sheet occurs where the ice is in contact with the warming ocean [2,8], specifically in fjords [9]. Warm ocean water infiltrates beneath the glacier tongue of ice shelf on the coastline of Greenland, resulting in undercutting of the ice, removing mass from the ice shelf [9].\nA range of models have been used to predict what may happen to this ice sheet in the future. The findings clearly show that the current net loss seen in Greenland will continue into the future, even under different emission scenarios[2,8].\nI am Laura Boyall, a PhD student in the Department of Geography at Royal Holloway University of London.

    "input_prompt": "Claim:\nCO2 levels have increased by more than a third since the Industrial Revolution.\n\nArticle Title:\nClimate change: atmospheric carbon dioxide\n\nGoogle Search Snippet:\nIn the past 60 years, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased 100-200 times faster than it did during the end of the last ice age.\n\nFull Page Content:\nIn the late 1950s, Roger Revelle, an American oceanographer based at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California began to ring the alarm bells over the amount of CO2 being emitted into the atmosphere. Revelle was very concerned about the greenhouse effect from this emission and was cautious because the carbon cycle was not then well understood. So, he decided that it would be wise to begin monitoring atmospheric concentrations of CO2. In the late 1950s, Revelle and a colleague, Charles Keeling, began monitoring atmospheric CO2 at an observatory on Mauna Loa, on the big island of Hawaii. Mauna Loa was chosen because its elevation and location away from industrial centers made it as close to a global signal as any other location. The record from Mauna Loa, one of the most classic plots in all of science, shown in the figure below, is a dramatic sign of global change that captured the attention of the whole world because it shows that this \"experiment\" we are conducting is apparently having a significant effect on the global carbon cycle. The climatological consequences of this change are potentially of great importance to the future of the global population. The CO2 concentration recently crossed the 400 ppm mark for the first time in millions of years! In 2025, the level has risen above 429 ppm (see CO2.Earth Webite (link is external) for most up to date estimate).\nAs the Mauna Loa record and others like it from around the world accumulated, a diverse group of scientists began to appreciate Revelle's concern that we really did not know too much about the global carbon cycle that ultimately regulates how much of our CO2 emissions stay in the atmosphere.\nThe importance of present-day changes in the carbon cycle, and the potential implications for climate change became much more apparent when scientists began to get results from studies of gas bubbles trapped in glacial ice. As we learned in Module 1, the bubbles are effectively samples of ancient atmospheres, and we can measure the concentration of CO2 and other trace gases like methane in these bubbles, and then by counting the annual layers preserved in glacial ice, we can date these atmospheric samples, providing a record of how CO2 changed over time in the past. The figure below shows the results of some of the ice core studies relevant for the recent past -- back to the year 900 A.D.\nThe striking feature of these data is that there is an exponential rise in atmospheric CO2 (and methane, another greenhouse gas) that connects with the more recent Mauna Loa record to produce a rather frightening trend. Also shown in the above figure is the record of fossil fuel emissions from around the world, which show a very similar exponential trend. Notice that these two data sets show an exponential rise that seems to begin at about the same time. What does this mean? Does it mean that there is a cause-and-effect relationship between emissions of CO2 and atmospheric CO2 levels? Although we should remember that science cannot prove things to be true beyond all doubt, it is highly likely that there is a cause-and-effect relationship -- it would be an extremely bizarre coincidence if the observed rise in atmospheric CO2 and the emissions of CO2 were unrelated.\nHow serious is our modification of the natural carbon cycle? Here, we need a slightly longer perspective from which to view our recent changes, so we return to the records from ice cores and look deeper and further back in time than we did in the figure we have been examining.\nIn addition to providing a record of the past concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, as we learned in Module 1, the ice cores also give us a temperature record. By studying the ratios of stable isotopes of oxygen that make up the glacial ice, we can estimate the temperature (in the region of the ice) at the time the snow fell (glacial ice is formed by the compression of snow as it gets buried to greater and greater depths). From these data, shown in the figure below, we can see the natural variations in atmospheric CO2 and temperature that have occurred over the past 160,000 years (160 kyr).\nIn fact, looking at this much longer span of time enables us to clearly see that the present CO2 concentration of the atmosphere is unprecedented in the last several hundreds of thousands of years.

This was due largely to industrialization and ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nIn the late 1950s, Roger Revelle, an American oceanographer based at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California began to ring the alarm bells over the amount of CO2 being emitted into the atmosphere. Revelle was very concerned about the greenhouse effect from this emission and was cautious because the carbon cycle was not then well understood. So, he decided that it would be wise to begin monitoring atmospheric concentrations of CO2. In the late 1950s, Revelle and a colleague, Charles Keeling, began monitoring atmospheric CO2 at an observatory on Mauna Loa, on the big island of Hawaii. Mauna Loa was chosen because its elevation and location away from industrial centers made it as close to a global signal as any other location. The record from Mauna Loa, one of the most classic plots in all of science, shown in the figure below, is a dramatic sign of global change that captured the attention of the whole world because it shows that this \"experiment\" we are conducting is apparently having a significant effect on the global carbon cycle. The climatological consequences of this change are potentially of great importance to the future of the global population. The CO2 concentration recently crossed the 400 ppm mark for the first time in millions of years! In 2025, the level has risen above 429 ppm (see CO2.Earth Webite (link is external) for most up to date estimate).\nAs the Mauna Loa record and others like it from around the world accumulated, a diverse group of scientists began to appreciate Revelle's concern that we really did not know too much about the global carbon cycle that ultimately regulates how much of our CO2 emissions stay in the atmosphere.\nThe importance of present-day changes in the carbon cycle, and the potential implications for climate change became much more apparent when scientists began to get results from studies of gas bubbles trapped in glacial ice. As we learned in Module 1, the bubbles are effectively samples of ancient atmospheres, and we can measure the concentration of CO2 and other trace gases like methane in these bubbles, and then by counting the annual layers preserved in glacial ice, we can date these atmospheric samples, providing a record of how CO2 changed over time in the past. The figure below shows the results of some of the ice core studies relevant for the recent past -- back to the year 900 A.D.\nThe striking feature of these data is that there is an exponential rise in atmospheric CO2 (and methane, another greenhouse gas) that connects with the more recent Mauna Loa record to produce a rather frightening trend. Also shown in the above figure is the record of fossil fuel emissions from around the world, which show a very similar exponential trend. Notice that these two data sets show an exponential rise that seems to begin at about the same time. What does this mean? Does it mean that there is a cause-and-effect relationship between emissions of CO2 and atmospheric CO2 levels? Although we should remember that science cannot prove things to be true beyond all doubt, it is highly likely that there is a cause-and-effect relationship -- it would be an extremely bizarre coincidence if the observed rise in atmospheric CO2 and the emissions of CO2 were unrelated.\nHow serious is our modification of the natural carbon cycle? Here, we need a slightly longer perspective from which to view our recent changes, so we return to the records from ice cores and look deeper and further back in time than we did in the figure we have been examining.\nIn addition to providing a record of the past concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, as we learned in Module 1, the ice cores also give us a temperature record. By studying the ratios of stable isotopes of oxygen that make up the glacial ice, we can estimate the temperature (in the region of the ice) at the time the snow fell (glacial ice is formed by the compression of snow as it gets buried to greater and greater depths). From these data, shown in the figure below, we can see the natural variations in atmospheric CO2 and temperature that have occurred over the past 160,000 years (160 kyr).\nIn fact, looking at this much longer span of time enables us to clearly see that the present CO2 concentration of the atmosphere is unprecedented in the last several hundreds of thousands of years. As geoscientists, we are interested in more than just the last few hundred kiloyears, and so we look back into the past using sediment cores retrieved from the deep sea. Geochemists studying these sediments have been able to reconstruct the approximate concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere and the sea surface temperature (SST).\nTo find atmospheric CO2 levels equivalent to the present, we have to go back 2.5 million years. This means that, to the extent that the state of the carbon cycle is closely linked to the condition of the global climate, we are pushing the system toward a climate that has not occurred any time within the last several million years -- not something to be taken lightly.\nThe farther back in time we go, the more difficult it is to figure out how CO2 concentrations have changed, but that has not stopped some from attempting:\nOne thing that is clear is that further back in time, CO2 levels have been much, much higher, and the average global temperatures have also been much higher.

According to a study led by researchers at the University of Barcelona, extreme melting episodes - periods when large areas of snow and ice melt rapidly - have been about twice as frequent during summers in recent decades compared to the period 1950-1990. The paper, published in the American Meteorological Society's Journal of Climate, shows that the last decade has seen peak years of extreme melting in Greenland. For example, during the summer of 2012, 610 gigatonnes of ice (the equivalent of 244 million Olympic-size swimming pools) melted, and in 2019, 560 gigatonnes (224 million Olympic-size swimming pools) melted.\nThe study was carried out by the Antarctica, Arctic and Alpine (ANTALP) research group of the UB's Department of Geography. It was led by lecturers and researchers from the Faculty of Geography and History Josep Bonsoms and Marc Oliva, Juan Ignacio L\u00f3pez-Moreno, a researcher at the Pyrenean Institute of Ecology (IPE-CSIC), and Xavier Fettweis, from the University of Li\u00e8ge (Belgium).\nThe study has analysed extreme melt episodes in Greenland between 1950 and 2022. The results show meltwater loss figures that, on average, have reached about 300 gigatonnes per year - the equivalent of a volume of about 48 million Olympic-size swimming pools per year - between 1980 and 2010. In addition, about 40% of the melting episodes have been extreme in recent decades. This figure rises to 50% in the coldest areas in the north and northwest of the island. \"This loss of surface glacial melt must be added to that of other dynamic processes, such as the detachment of icebergs directly into the sea and the flow of glaciers into the ocean, both of which are accelerated by increased melting\", add the UB researchers.\nIce melting phenomena have been directly linked to global warming, with recent studies showing that the Arctic is warming at four times the global average rate due to increased greenhouse gases. The authors of the study explain that \"increased melting is closely related to episodes of extreme warmth caused by more frequent, warmer and wetter anticyclonic air masses from more northern latitudes\". \"These atmospheric patterns keep the air over Greenland stagnant during the summer, increase solar radiation and reduce the albedo (sunlight reflectance) of snow and ice, which further accelerates warming and melting\", they add.\nAccording to UB researchers, melting is occurring in higher areas of the ice cap, where no ice melt was previously observed between 1950 and 1990. This has created cracks and other structural changes in the ice sheet, and increases the risk of large blocks of ice breaking off into the ocean. \"International climate reports anticipate a significant increase in temperatures in the polar regions, which would accelerate the trend we have observed in this study\", the researchers add.\nA study by the University of Barcelona reveals that ice melting in Greenland has increased dramatically in recent decades, contributing to sea level rise and affecting global weather patterns\nFuture predictions and impacts in Europe Greenland's melting ice has global consequences, as it is a major contributor to sea level rise and it also affects atmospheric circulation patterns. According to the researchers, these alterations may also influence Europe's climate. \"These changes in temperature and precipitation patterns could impact on socio-economic activities, ecosystems and may contribute to increased climate extremes in nearby regions of the North Atlantic\", the experts note. In addition, the researchers also warn that projected climate scenarios indicate an increase in these episodes: \"This highlights the urgency of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate the impacts of climate change in the coming decades\", they conclude.\nView the study\nPlease note: Content is displayed as last posted by a PreventionWeb community member or editor.

The increase during 2024 was 3.75 ppm\u2014the largest one-year increase on record. At Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii (graph above), where the modern carbon dioxide record began in 1958, the annual average carbon dioxide in 2024 was 424.61 ppm, also a new record.\nThe years with the largest annual carbon dioxide growth tend to be associated with the strongest El Ni\u00f1os\u2014the warm phase of a natural climate pattern in the tropical Pacific\u2014which lead to high temperatures over land and sea and an expansion of global drought area. In turn, these weather conditions typically lead to less plant growth, which reduces carbon dioxide uptake, as well as increased decomposition of carbon in soil and increased carbon dioxide emissions from forest fires. Together, these impacts cause atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to rise faster than normal.\nEven though the 2023-24 El Ni\u00f1o had waned by April, record high air temperatures and drought in all of 2024, similar to those during an El Nino, were likely drivers of the large increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide in 2024. In addition to other factors, large forest fires in both the Amazon and Canada contributed to the 2024 global increase.\nCarbon dioxide concentrations are rising mostly because of the fossil fuels that people have been burning for energy since the start of the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuels like coal and oil contain the carbon from millions of years of photosynthesis\u2014the process by which plants remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. We are returning that carbon to the atmosphere in just a few hundred years. Since the middle of the 20th century, annual emissions of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels have increased every decade, from close to 11 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year in the 1960s to an estimated 37.4 billion tons in 2024 according to the Global Carbon Budget 2024.\nThe amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (blue line) has increased along with human emissions (gray line) since the start of the Industrial Revolution in 1750. Emissions rose slowly to about 5 gigatons (1 gigaton is 1 billion metric tons per year) in the mid-20th century before rapidly increasing to more than 35 billion tons per year by the end of the century. NOAA Climate.gov graph, adapted from original by Dr. Howard Diamond (NOAA ARL). Atmospheric carbon dioxide data from NOAA and ETHZ. Carbon dioxide emissions data from Our World in Data and the Global Carbon Project.\nCarbon cycle experts estimate that natural \u201csinks,\u201d including plant growth and ocean absorption, remove about half of carbon dioxide humans emit into the atmosphere from fossil fuel burning. The rest stays in the atmosphere. Every year, we are adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than natural sinks can remove, and so the total amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere goes up. The bigger the overshoot, the faster atmospheric carbon dioxide increases.\nIn the 1960s, atmospheric carbon dioxide increased by about 0.8 ppm per year on average. That growth rate doubled to an average of 1.6 ppm per year in the 1980s and 1.5 ppm per year in the 1990s. In the last decade (2015-2024), the annual increase has accelerated to 2.6 ppm per year. As a result, the annual rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide over the past 60 years is 100-200 times faster than the increase that occurred at the end of the last ice age 11,000-17,000 years ago.\nCarbon dioxide is Earth\u2019s most important long-lived greenhouse gas: a gas that absorbs and radiates heat. Unlike oxygen or nitrogen (which make up most of Earth's atmosphere), greenhouse gases absorb heat radiating from the Earth\u2019s surface and re-release it in all directions\u2014including back toward Earth\u2019s surface. Without any carbon dioxide, Earth\u2019s natural greenhouse effect would be too weak to keep the average global surface temperature above freezing.\nBy adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, people are amplifying the natural greenhouse effect, causing global temperature to rise. According to observations and analysis by the NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory, carbon dioxide alone is responsible for about 80 percent of the total heating influence of all human-produced greenhouse gases since 1990.\nAnother reason carbon dioxide is important in the Earth system is that it dissolves into the ocean like the fizz in a can of soda. It reacts with water molecules, producing carbonic acid and lowering the ocean's pH (raising its acidity). Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, the pH of the ocean's surface waters has dropped from 8.21 to 8.10.

The Greenland Ice Sheet is the largest ice mass in the Northern Hemisphere. It lies from 71\u00b0N northwards, between the Atlantic and the Arctic Ocean [1]. Almost 80% of Greenland\u2019s landmass is covered by the ice sheet, expanding an area over 1.7 million km2. The ice from the centre flows through a series of drainage networks with both outlet glaciers and ice streams, all flowing towards the ocean, with some ending in glacial ice tongues [2].\nUnlike Antarctica, which has almost 75% of its coastline dominated by floating ice shelves, Greenland has only ice tongues. They are fewer in number and are constrained to fjords [3].\nOver the past few years, there has been an increase in the understanding on the topography beneath the ice sheet from the development of BedMachine v3 [4]. This was created using a series of remote sensing techniques and bathymetric data from the surrounding oceans. This dataset has now allowed the visualisation and quantification of the volume of ice present on the ice sheet, the bed topography, and the thickness of ice. BedMachine has showed that Greenland\u2019s topography has a saucerlike basin in the centre, with much of it at, or below current sea levels [1,4].\nThe data from BedMachine has shows that some of the central parts of the ice sheet has an ice thickness average of >3000 m. This understanding has enabled the calculation of the global sea level rise potential of the Greenland Ice Sheet. This is now calculated to be 7.4 m [2,4]. This means that if all the ice in Greenland melted, global sea levels would rise by 7.4 m on average globally.\nIce sheets play an integral role in the global climate system, thus it is important to understand how they have responded in the past. This better prepares us for future changes to both the climate, and global sea level rise [5,6].\nDuring the Quaternary Period (last 2.6 Ma), the Greenland Ice Sheet was one of a series of ice sheets dominating the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes. This included an ice sheet over North America (the Laurentide Ice Sheet) and over Europe, including Britain (the Eurasian Ice Sheet). The Greenland Ice Sheet held an additional 4.1 m sea level equivalent of ice during the global Last Glacial Maximum [10].\nHowever, since start of the current interglacial period, around 11,700 years ago, the Greenland Ice Sheet is the only one to remain. During these glacial periods, the Greenland Ice Shelf was larger than its present extent, whereas in past interglacials, evidence shows that Greenland had significantly less ice than its present day distribution [7].\nOver recent decades, the increase in air and ocean temperatures has resulted in the mass loss of ice through iceberg calving, meltwater runoff, and ocean-driven melting, all contributing a negative surface mass balance [2,5]. The figure here demonstrates that over the recent years, Greenland\u2019s melting season has fallen well below the 1981-2020 mean with most of the melt occurring in the Northern Hemisphere summer [1].\nThis loss of ice from the Greenland Ice Sheet is directly influencing the global mean sea level. Current observations show that it is raising global sea levels by ~0.69 mm yr-1 [5] which is greater than the contribution from the Antarctic ice sheets combined [5]. Satellite measurements from the early 1990s to 2018 recorded a mass loss of 3800 \u00b1 339 billion tonnes of ice, altogether, contributed 10.6 \u00b1 0.9 mm to global sea levels.\nA large proportion of ice loss from this ice sheet occurs where the ice is in contact with the warming ocean [2,8], specifically in fjords [9]. Warm ocean water infiltrates beneath the glacier tongue of ice shelf on the coastline of Greenland, resulting in undercutting of the ice, removing mass from the ice shelf [9].\nA range of models have been used to predict what may happen to this ice sheet in the future. The findings clearly show that the current net loss seen in Greenland will continue into the future, even under different emission scenarios[2,8].\nI am Laura Boyall, a PhD student in the Department of Geography at Royal Holloway University of London.

NOAA Climate.gov image, based on Mauna Loa monthly mean data from NOAA Global Monitoring Lab.\nBased on the annual analysis from NOAA\u2019s Global Monitoring Lab, global average atmospheric carbon dioxide was 422.8 parts per million (\u201cppm,\u201d for short) in 2024, a new record high. The increase during 2024 was 3.75 ppm\u2014the largest one-year increase on record. At Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii (graph above), where the modern carbon dioxide record began in 1958, the annual average carbon dioxide in 2024 was 424.61 ppm, also a new record.\nThe years with the largest annual carbon dioxide growth tend to be associated with the strongest El Ni\u00f1os\u2014the warm phase of a natural climate pattern in the tropical Pacific\u2014which lead to high temperatures over land and sea and an expansion of global drought area. In turn, these weather conditions typically lead to less plant growth, which reduces carbon dioxide uptake, as well as increased decomposition of carbon in soil and increased carbon dioxide emissions from forest fires. Together, these impacts cause atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to rise faster than normal.\nEven though the 2023-24 El Ni\u00f1o had waned by April, record high air temperatures and drought in all of 2024, similar to those during an El Nino, were likely drivers of the large increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide in 2024. In addition to other factors, large forest fires in both the Amazon and Canada contributed to the 2024 global increase.\nCarbon dioxide concentrations are rising mostly because of the fossil fuels that people have been burning for energy since the start of the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuels like coal and oil contain the carbon from millions of years of photosynthesis\u2014the process by which plants remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. We are returning that carbon to the atmosphere in just a few hundred years. Since the middle of the 20th century, annual emissions of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels have increased every decade, from close to 11 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year in the 1960s to an estimated 37.4 billion tons in 2024 according to the Global Carbon Budget 2024.\nThe amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (blue line) has increased along with human emissions (gray line) since the start of the Industrial Revolution in 1750. Emissions rose slowly to about 5 gigatons (1 gigaton is 1 billion metric tons per year) in the mid-20th century before rapidly increasing to more than 35 billion tons per year by the end of the century. NOAA Climate.gov graph, adapted from original by Dr. Howard Diamond (NOAA ARL). Atmospheric carbon dioxide data from NOAA and ETHZ. Carbon dioxide emissions data from Our World in Data and the Global Carbon Project.\nCarbon cycle experts estimate that natural \u201csinks,\u201d including plant growth and ocean absorption, remove about half of carbon dioxide humans emit into the atmosphere from fossil fuel burning. The rest stays in the atmosphere. Every year, we are adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than natural sinks can remove, and so the total amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere goes up. The bigger the overshoot, the faster atmospheric carbon dioxide increases.\nIn the 1960s, atmospheric carbon dioxide increased by about 0.8 ppm per year on average. That growth rate doubled to an average of 1.6 ppm per year in the 1980s and 1.5 ppm per year in the 1990s. In the last decade (2015-2024), the annual increase has accelerated to 2.6 ppm per year. As a result, the annual rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide over the past 60 years is 100-200 times faster than the increase that occurred at the end of the last ice age 11,000-17,000 years ago.\nCarbon dioxide is Earth\u2019s most important long-lived greenhouse gas: a gas that absorbs and radiates heat. Unlike oxygen or nitrogen (which make up most of Earth's atmosphere), greenhouse gases absorb heat radiating from the Earth\u2019s surface and re-release it in all directions\u2014including back toward Earth\u2019s surface. Without any carbon dioxide, Earth\u2019s natural greenhouse effect would be too weak to keep the average global surface temperature above freezing.\nBy adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, people are amplifying the natural greenhouse effect, causing global temperature to rise. According to observations and analysis by the NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory, carbon dioxide alone is responsible for about 80 percent of the total heating influence of all human-produced greenhouse gases since 1990.\nAnother reason carbon dioxide is important in the Earth system is that it dissolves into the ocean like the fizz in a can of soda. It reacts with water molecules, producing carbonic acid and lowering the ocean's pH (raising its acidity). Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, the pH of the ocean's surface waters has dropped from 8.21 to 8.10. This drop in pH is called ocean acidification, and it interferes with the ability of marine life to extract calcium from sea water to build skeletons and shells.\n(left) A healthy ocean snail has a transparent shell with smoothly contoured ridges.

Trend: Stable CO2 levels until the Industrial Revolution (~ ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nIn the late 1950s, Roger Revelle, an American oceanographer based at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California began to ring the alarm bells over the amount of CO2 being emitted into the atmosphere. Revelle was very concerned about the greenhouse effect from this emission and was cautious because the carbon cycle was not then well understood. So, he decided that it would be wise to begin monitoring atmospheric concentrations of CO2. In the late 1950s, Revelle and a colleague, Charles Keeling, began monitoring atmospheric CO2 at an observatory on Mauna Loa, on the big island of Hawaii. Mauna Loa was chosen because its elevation and location away from industrial centers made it as close to a global signal as any other location. The record from Mauna Loa, one of the most classic plots in all of science, shown in the figure below, is a dramatic sign of global change that captured the attention of the whole world because it shows that this \"experiment\" we are conducting is apparently having a significant effect on the global carbon cycle. The climatological consequences of this change are potentially of great importance to the future of the global population. The CO2 concentration recently crossed the 400 ppm mark for the first time in millions of years! In 2025, the level has risen above 429 ppm (see CO2.Earth Webite (link is external) for most up to date estimate).\nAs the Mauna Loa record and others like it from around the world accumulated, a diverse group of scientists began to appreciate Revelle's concern that we really did not know too much about the global carbon cycle that ultimately regulates how much of our CO2 emissions stay in the atmosphere.\nThe importance of present-day changes in the carbon cycle, and the potential implications for climate change became much more apparent when scientists began to get results from studies of gas bubbles trapped in glacial ice. As we learned in Module 1, the bubbles are effectively samples of ancient atmospheres, and we can measure the concentration of CO2 and other trace gases like methane in these bubbles, and then by counting the annual layers preserved in glacial ice, we can date these atmospheric samples, providing a record of how CO2 changed over time in the past. The figure below shows the results of some of the ice core studies relevant for the recent past -- back to the year 900 A.D.\nThe striking feature of these data is that there is an exponential rise in atmospheric CO2 (and methane, another greenhouse gas) that connects with the more recent Mauna Loa record to produce a rather frightening trend. Also shown in the above figure is the record of fossil fuel emissions from around the world, which show a very similar exponential trend. Notice that these two data sets show an exponential rise that seems to begin at about the same time. What does this mean? Does it mean that there is a cause-and-effect relationship between emissions of CO2 and atmospheric CO2 levels? Although we should remember that science cannot prove things to be true beyond all doubt, it is highly likely that there is a cause-and-effect relationship -- it would be an extremely bizarre coincidence if the observed rise in atmospheric CO2 and the emissions of CO2 were unrelated.\nHow serious is our modification of the natural carbon cycle? Here, we need a slightly longer perspective from which to view our recent changes, so we return to the records from ice cores and look deeper and further back in time than we did in the figure we have been examining.\nIn addition to providing a record of the past concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, as we learned in Module 1, the ice cores also give us a temperature record. By studying the ratios of stable isotopes of oxygen that make up the glacial ice, we can estimate the temperature (in the region of the ice) at the time the snow fell (glacial ice is formed by the compression of snow as it gets buried to greater and greater depths). From these data, shown in the figure below, we can see the natural variations in atmospheric CO2 and temperature that have occurred over the past 160,000 years (160 kyr).\nIn fact, looking at this much longer span of time enables us to clearly see that the present CO2 concentration of the atmosphere is unprecedented in the last several hundreds of thousands of years. As geoscientists, we are interested in more than just the last few hundred kiloyears, and so we look back into the past using sediment cores retrieved from the deep sea. Geochemists studying these sediments have been able to reconstruct the approximate concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere and the sea surface temperature (SST).\nTo find atmospheric CO2 levels equivalent to the present, we have to go back 2.5 million years. This means that, to the extent that the state of the carbon cycle is closely linked to the condition of the global climate, we are pushing the system toward a climate that has not occurred any time within the last several million years -- not something to be taken lightly.\nThe farther back in time we go, the more difficult it is to figure out how CO2 concentrations have changed, but that has not stopped some from attempting:\nOne thing that is clear is that further back in time, CO2 levels have been much, much higher, and the average global temperatures have also been much higher. Why does the CO2 concentration change so much? This is a big question whose answer involves many factors, but consider two that are relevant to what we'll learn about in this module. Photosynthesis only started in the Silurian (S on the timescale in the figure above), and photosynthesis is a major sink or absorber of atmospheric CO2. Sea level was much higher during the two big peaks in CO2 \u2014 this leaves less room for photosynthesis and it also decreases the planet's albedo, making it warmer. A warmer ocean cannot absorb atmospheric CO2 and instead, it releases it to the atmosphere.\nIn conclusion, from this brief look at the re\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Fossil fuels like coal and oil contain the carbon from millions of years of photosynthesis\u2014the process by which plants remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. We are returning that carbon to the atmosphere in just a few hundred years. Since the middle of the 20th century, annual emissions of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels have increased every decade, from close to 11 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year in the 1960s to an estimated 37.4 billion tons in 2024 according to the Global Carbon Budget 2024.\nThe amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (blue line) has increased along with human emissions (gray line) since the start of the Industrial Revolution in 1750. Emissions rose slowly to about 5 gigatons (1 gigaton is 1 billion metric tons per year) in the mid-20th century before rapidly increasing to more than 35 billion tons per year by the end of the century. NOAA Climate.gov graph, adapted from original by Dr. Howard Diamond (NOAA ARL). Atmospheric carbon dioxide data from NOAA and ETHZ. Carbon dioxide emissions data from Our World in Data and the Global Carbon Project.\nCarbon cycle experts estimate that natural \u201csinks,\u201d including plant growth and ocean absorption, remove about half of carbon dioxide humans emit into the atmosphere from fossil fuel burning. The rest stays in the atmosphere. Every year, we are adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than natural sinks can remove, and so the total amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere goes up. The bigger the overshoot, the faster atmospheric carbon dioxide increases.\nIn the 1960s, atmospheric carbon dioxide increased by about 0.8 ppm per year on average. That growth rate doubled to an average of 1.6 ppm per year in the 1980s and 1.5 ppm per year in the 1990s. In the last decade (2015-2024), the annual increase has accelerated to 2.6 ppm per year. As a result, the annual rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide over the past 60 years is 100-200 times faster than the increase that occurred at the end of the last ice age 11,000-17,000 years ago.\nCarbon dioxide is Earth\u2019s most important long-lived greenhouse gas: a gas that absorbs and radiates heat. Unlike oxygen or nitrogen (which make up most of Earth's atmosphere), greenhouse gases absorb heat radiating from the Earth\u2019s surface and re-release it in all directions\u2014including back toward Earth\u2019s surface. Without any carbon dioxide, Earth\u2019s natural greenhouse effect would be too weak to keep the average global surface temperature above freezing.\nBy adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, people are amplifying the natural greenhouse effect, causing global temperature to rise. According to observations and analysis by the NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory, carbon dioxide alone is responsible for about 80 percent of the total heating influence of all human-produced greenhouse gases since 1990.\nAnother reason carbon dioxide is important in the Earth system is that it dissolves into the ocean like the fizz in a can of soda. It reacts with water molecules, producing carbonic acid and lowering the ocean's pH (raising its acidity). Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, the pH of the ocean's surface waters has dropped from 8.21 to 8.10. This drop in pH is called ocean acidification, and it interferes with the ability of marine life to extract calcium from sea water to build skeletons and shells.\n(left) A healthy ocean snail has a transparent shell with smoothly contoured ridges.
