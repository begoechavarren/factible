    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nhi everyone this is monty i've been doing some investigation into the floor nation of our uh water here in lebanon oregon and i got a letter from the harvard university they posted in the federal government's journal confirms that fluoride lowers iqs and that was on july 27 2012. you can you can most likely find it in uh just by typing in but you can see it's a major harvard university study that confirms that the fluorination of our city water lowers our children's iq now you would think that that would cause writing in the streets demanding that we would have fluoride removed from our water but ironically it doesn't another study this one done by harvard university on july 26th that says it was published in the national institute of health journal finds that fluoride lowers children's iq that's the florida nation of your city water and this is the article right here again it's a harvard university study now both of those were done in this year and you would think that as soon as the american people found out for sure through harvard university after they've done extensive studies that the fluoridation of our water supply causes our children redox retardation making our children's iqs lower causing problems and and families and health you think that people would uh be freaking out and getting the flu right out you think we wouldn't even have to ask our governments and our townships to remove the fluoride fluoride from our water they don't do it you have to fight tooth and now and chances are they're sterile aren't going to do it but if you're not worried about lowering iqs you know everybody says oh my kid's stupid you know we're used to hearing it but here's another release published in april 5th 2006 another one from harvard university studies shows a link between fluorinated water and bone cancer in boys so you know it just goes on and on it's just link after link all of these studies from harvard university uh not to mention the 3600 000 other studies that have been done by numerous people that just plagues this whole fluoridation of water and that people aren't doing anything about it they're not stopping it why is this being put in our water when it is causing the iqs of our children to be lowered causing uh all kinds of problems now here's a great thing me and my girl went to see her obgyn the other day and she had some work done on her while i was in the office i was talking to this specialist with women and children this lady is a doctor who specializes in child rearing and and women issues and stuff and i asked her what she knew about fluoride and she said that she strongly recommends that babies be fed special water that has been specially more foreign more fluorination put in the baby's water for the use of their uh for for their feedings and i asked her if she looked into it she said she felt some concerns about the recent stories of uh you know how fluoride is linked in in brain damage and she she said she hadn't really looked into it too much and i said well i just got you know i told her the story i just got this information on july 26 27th that uh from harvard saying that they definitely have confirmed it does lower uh children's iq and she said for years she'd been telling mothers of newborn babies to buy fluorinated water to feed their babies to put in their babies bottles so that their baby's teeth would be better and stronger well here's an interesting note the nurse that was helping this doctor says hey wait a minute uh i come from austin texas and they have natural fluorination of the water there where the water is over fluorinated and everybody in the town all the town of 300 000 people have white pitted stuff on their teeth and uh she said and everybody in the town acts literally like a bunch of dumbasses those are her words not mine she said that it's just a bunch of hooligans and everybody's kind of hillbilly mentality real low iq individuals and of course their waters naturally overflowed fluorinated it's called uh fluorination opmosis or something like that when you have too much fluorine in your body you get uh white spots on your teeth now here's just a thought if you know anybody with white spots on their teeth ask them a couple of simple questions and see if they're a dumbass because from what i hear from this nurse the people over in austin texas or somewhere around that uh all live in a town where the water has too much fluorine in it naturally and they're all a bunch of dumbasses uh hicks you know she this is her words not mine i i don't know i live in lebanon oregon and uh at any rate get sidetracked here there's all these studies out there saying that uh people who generally are angry and have gang-related problems and are fighting and are criminals usually have lower iqs people who are afraid when you become afraid your iq automatically goes down you lose a couple of points when you get really scared also when you get really angry you lose a couple of points you know it's briefly that's why people who get angry do stupid things what happens when you feed a baby from birth fluorinated water and they drink it their whole life haven't you noticed lately that our kids in america or just slightly not normal i have and i'm only 46 years old and i've noticed a huge decline in intelligence in our kids and i believe the world steady on children's iqs america's kids come in way under the mark like a hundred in the world our children that are being fed by by our country fluoride have the lowest iqs in in the world i mean there's a few countries that are lower in ours but i'm not even really sure there's anybody living there anyway these are just my views and they're backed with you know facts and i did talk to an ogbyn who said that she was recommending that babies drink specially high fluorinated water babies teeth fall out and they get new ones wouldn't it make more sense to wait until they were older to drink fluorinated water however fluoride isn't something that's brought in through the body system through digestion it's a topical thing if you go to a dentist the dentist puts it in a cup and sticks it on your teeth it's because it's absorbed through the teeth it's not absorbed through the body by drinking it and what what parts of it is is absorbed through it would require large amounts for it to do anything your teeth uh hence austin texas and then getting the white spots on their teeth look this stuff up it's on the internet i would like everybody to go and stop the fluorination of water and i think that we need to investigate how this stuff got put in and what is behind it now some people say well monty you're just a conspiracy theorist well that may very well be true but at least if i'm a conspiracy theorist then these people over in the harvard university need to be tarred and feathered because they're saying the same thing i am fluoride makes our children a bunch of retards anyways if you have any thoughts about this feel free to uh drop me a message also you know share this information and hit like on there and also uh subscribe thank you have a good day",

Health concerns expressed by opponents have largely been dismissed until recently. Now, evidence is mounting that in an era of fluoridated toothpastes and other consumer products that boost dental health, the potential risks from consuming fluoridated water may outweigh the benefits for some individuals. Last summer, for the first time in 53 years, the U.S. Public Health Service lowered its recommended levels of fluoride in drinking water.\nBeginning in the early 20th century, scientists linked high levels of naturally occurring fluoride in certain community water supplies to low levels of tooth decay. In 1945, Grand Rapids, Michigan, became the first community in the world to add fluoride to tap water. When subsequent studies showed a significantly lower rate of cavities in schoolchildren, water fluoridation spread to other towns and cities. U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention named community water fluoridation one of the 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century.\nBut many experts now question the scientific basis for the intervention. In June 2015, the Cochrane Collaboration\u2014a global independent network of researchers and health care professionals known for rigorous scientific reviews of public health policies\u2014published an analysis of 20 key studies on water fluoridation. They found that while water fluoridation is effective at reducing tooth decay among children, \u201cno studies that aimed to determine the effectiveness of water fluoridation for preventing caries [cavities] in adults met the review\u2019s inclusion criteria.\u201d *\nThe Cochrane report also concluded that early scientific investigations on water fluoridation (most were conducted before 1975) were deeply flawed. \u201cWe had concerns about the methods used, or the reporting of the results, in \u2026 97 percent of the studies,\u201d the authors noted. One problem: The early studies didn\u2019t take into account the subsequent widespread use of fluoride-containing toothpastes and other dental fluoride supplements, which also prevent cavities. This may explain why countries that do not fluoridate their water have also seen big drops in cavity rates (see chart).\nCountries with fluoridated water\nSource: OECD.Stat/Dental Health\nCountries without fluoridated water\nSource: OECD.Stat/Dental Health\nChart updated on June 15, 2016. An earlier version of this chart incorrectly listed Australia and Chile as having non-fluoridated water. The water in both countries is fluoridated.\nMoreover, fluoride itself may be dangerous at high levels. Excessive fluoride causes fluorosis\u2014changes in tooth enamel that range from barely noticeable white spots to staining and pitting. Fluoride can also become concentrated in bone\u2014stimulating bone cell growth, altering the tissue\u2019s structure, and weakening the skeleton.\nPerhaps most worrisome is preliminary research in laboratory animals suggesting that high levels of fluoride may be toxic to brain and nerve cells. And human epidemiological studies have identified possible links to learning, memory, and cognition deficits, though most of these studies have focused on populations with fluoride exposures higher than those typically provided by U.S. water supplies.\nComments by Philippe Grandjean, adjunct professor of environmental health, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health:\n\u201cWe should recognize that fluoride has beneficial effects on dental development and protection against cavities. But do we need to add it to drinking water so it gets into the bloodstream and potentially into the brain? To answer this, we must establish three research priorities.\n\u201cFirst, since dental cavities have decreased in countries both with and without water fluoridation, we need to make sure we are dosing our water with the proper amount of fluoride for dental medicine purposes, but no more.\n\u201cSecond, we need to make sure fluoridation doesn\u2019t raise the risk of adverse health effects. In particular, we need basic research on animals that would help us understand the mechanisms by which fluoride may be toxic to the developing brain.\n\u201cThird, we need to find out if there are populations highly vulnerable to fluoride in drinking water\u2014bottle-fed infants whose formula is made with tap water, for example, or patients undergoing dialysis. If these individuals are at risk, their water must come from a source that is lower in fluoride.\u201d\n*This description of the Cochrane Collaboration\u2019s findings in relation to water fluoridation and adult cavities is a clarification of the text in the print edition of the Spring 2016 Harvard Public Health, where this article originally appeared.\nNicole Davis is a science writer and communications consultant specializing in biomedicine and biotechnology. She holds a PhD in genetics from Harvard University.\n[contentarea background=\u201d#dbdbdb\u201d]\nLetters in response to \u201cIs Fluoridated Drinking Water Safe?\u201d\nThe article \u201cIs Fluoridated Drinking Water Safe?\u201d generated much response from the magazine\u2019s readers.

They found that while water fluoridation is effective at reducing tooth decay among children, \u201cno studies that aimed to determine the effectiveness of water fluoridation for preventing caries [cavities] in adults met the review\u2019s inclusion criteria.\u201d *\nThe Cochrane report also concluded that early scientific investigations on water fluoridation (most were conducted before 1975) were deeply flawed. \u201cWe had concerns about the methods used, or the reporting of the results, in \u2026 97 percent of the studies,\u201d the authors noted. One problem: The early studies didn\u2019t take into account the subsequent widespread use of fluoride-containing toothpastes and other dental fluoride supplements, which also prevent cavities. This may explain why countries that do not fluoridate their water have also seen big drops in cavity rates (see chart).\nCountries with fluoridated water\nSource: OECD.Stat/Dental Health\nCountries without fluoridated water\nSource: OECD.Stat/Dental Health\nChart updated on June 15, 2016. An earlier version of this chart incorrectly listed Australia and Chile as having non-fluoridated water. The water in both countries is fluoridated.\nMoreover, fluoride itself may be dangerous at high levels. Excessive fluoride causes fluorosis\u2014changes in tooth enamel that range from barely noticeable white spots to staining and pitting. Fluoride can also become concentrated in bone\u2014stimulating bone cell growth, altering the tissue\u2019s structure, and weakening the skeleton.\nPerhaps most worrisome is preliminary research in laboratory animals suggesting that high levels of fluoride may be toxic to brain and nerve cells. And human epidemiological studies have identified possible links to learning, memory, and cognition deficits, though most of these studies have focused on populations with fluoride exposures higher than those typically provided by U.S. water supplies.\nComments by Philippe Grandjean, adjunct professor of environmental health, Harvard T.H.

Extremely high levels of fluoride are known to cause neurotoxicity in adults, and negative impacts on memory and learning have been reported in rodent studies, but little is known about the substance\u2019s impact on children\u2019s neurodevelopment. In a meta-analysis, researchers from Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) and China Medical University in Shenyang for the first time combined 27 studies and found strong indications that fluoride may adversely affect cognitive development in children. Based on the findings, the authors say that this risk should not be ignored, and that more research on fluoride\u2019s impact on the developing brain is warranted.\nThe study was published online in Environmental Health Perspectives on July 20, 2012.\nThe researchers conducted a systematic review of studies, almost all of which are from China where risks from fluoride are well-established. Fluoride is a naturally occurring substance in groundwater, and exposures to the chemical are increased in some parts of China. Virtually no human studies in this field have been conducted in the U.S., said lead author Anna Choi, research scientist in the Department of Environmental Health at HSPH.\nEven though many of the studies on children in China differed in many ways or were incomplete, the authors consider the data compilation and joint analysis an important first step in evaluating the potential risk. \u201cFor the first time we have been able to do a comprehensive meta-analysis that has the potential for helping us plan better studies. We want to make sure that cognitive development is considered as a possible target for fluoride toxicity,\u201d Choi said.\nChoi and senior author Philippe Grandjean, adjunct professor of environmental health at HSPH, and their colleagues collated the epidemiological studies of children exposed to fluoride from drinking water. The China National Knowledge Infrastructure database also was included to locate studies published in Chinese journals. They then analyzed possible associations with IQ measures in more than 8,000 children of school age; all but one study suggested that high fluoride content in water may negatively affect cognitive development.\nThe average loss in IQ was reported as a standardized weighted mean difference of 0.45, which would be approximately equivalent to seven IQ points for commonly used IQ scores with a standard deviation of 15.* Some studies suggested that even slightly increased fluoride exposure could be toxic to the brain. Thus, children in high-fluoride areas had significantly lower IQ scores than those who lived in low-fluoride areas. The children studied were up to 14 years of age, but the investigators speculate that any toxic effect on brain development may have happened earlier, and that the brain may not be fully capable of compensating for the toxicity.\n\u201cFluoride seems to fit in with lead, mercury, and other poisons that cause chemical brain drain,\u201d Grandjean says. \u201cThe effect of each toxicant may seem small, but the combined damage on a population scale can be serious, especially because the brain power of the next generation is crucial to all of us.\u201d\n* This sentence was updated on September 5, 2012.\nRead a September 2012 statement by the authors.\n** Learn more about the IQ measurements by HSPH\u2019s Anna L. Choi and Philippe Grandjean in response to a letter to the journal published in the March 2013 (Vol. 121, No. 3) Environmental Health Perspectives.\nDecember 19, 2014 \u2014 As a follow-up, Philippe Grandjean, adjunct professor of environmental health at Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH), Anna Choi, research scientist in the Department of Environmental Health, and colleagues have published a pilot study of cognitive functions in Chinese children exposed to different levels of fluoride from drinking water.\nThe new paper, entitled \u201cAssociation of lifetime exposure to fluoride and cognitive functions in Chinese children: A pilot study,\u201d has been published online and in the January-February 2015 issue of Neurotoxicology and Teratology.\n\u2014 Marge Dwyer\nStay connected with Harvard Chan School\nIn addition to our degree programs, we offer highly targeted executive and continuing education, directed and taught by Harvard faculty.\nStay connected with newsletters on climate, nutrition, communication \u2014 and the latest from Harvard Chan School.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

We also searched the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database, because many studies on fluoride neurotoxicity have been published in Chinese journals only. In total, we identified 27 eligible epidemiological studies with high and reference exposures, end points of IQ scores, or related cognitive function measures with means and variances for the two exposure groups. Using random-effects models, we estimated the standardized mean difference between exposed and reference groups across all studies. We conducted sensitivity analyses restricted to studies using the same outcome assessment and having drinking-water fluoride as the only exposure. We performed the Cochran test for heterogeneity between studies, Begg's funnel plot, and Egger test to assess publication bias, and conducted meta-regressions to explore sources of variation in mean differences among the studies.\nResults: The standardized weighted mean difference in IQ score between exposed and reference populations was -0.45 (95% confidence interval: -0.56, -0.35) using a random-effects model. Thus, children in high-fluoride areas had significantly lower IQ scores than those who lived in low-fluoride areas. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses also indicated inverse associations, although the substantial heterogeneity did not appear to decrease.\nConclusions: The results support the possibility of an adverse effect of high fluoride exposure on children's neurodevelopment. Future research should include detailed individual-level information on prenatal exposure, neurobehavioral performance, and covariates for adjustment.\nPubMed Disclaimer\nThe authors declare they have no actual or potential competing financial interests.\nFigure 1\nFlow diagram of the meta-analysis.\nFigure 2\nRandom-effect standardized weighted mean difference\u2026\nFigure 3\nBegg\u2019s funnel plot showing individual\u2026\nNCBI Literature Resources\nMeSH PMC Bookshelf Disclaimer\nThe PubMed wordmark and PubMed logo are registered trademarks of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

If these individuals are at risk, their water must come from a source that is lower in fluoride.\u201d\n*This description of the Cochrane Collaboration\u2019s findings in relation to water fluoridation and adult cavities is a clarification of the text in the print edition of the Spring 2016 Harvard Public Health, where this article originally appeared.\nNicole Davis is a science writer and communications consultant specializing in biomedicine and biotechnology.

Of these investigations, 69 studies have found that elevated fluoride exposure is associated with reduced IQ in humans, while over 60 animal studies have found that fluoride exposure impairs the learning and/or memory capacity of animals. The human studies, which are based on IQ examinations of 26,142 children (67 studies) and 245 adults (2 studies), provide compelling evidence that fluoride exposure during the early years of life can damage a child\u2019s developing brain.\nAfter reviewing 27 of the human IQ studies, a team of Harvard scientists concluded that fluoride\u2019s effect on the young brain should now be a \u201chigh research priority.\u201d (Choi, et al 2012). Other reviewers have reached similar conclusions, including the prestigious National Research Council (NRC), and scientists in the Neurotoxicology Division of the Environmental Protection Agency (Mundy, et al). In the list of the IQ studies, we summarize the results from the 69 studies that have found associations between fluoride and reduced IQ and provide links to the abstracts or full-text copies, whe available, of the studies.\nFor a discussion of the 8 studies that did not find an association between fluoride and IQ, click here.\nIQ reductions have been significantly associated with fluoride levels of just 0.7 mg/L (Green 2019); 0.15 to 1.38 mg/L (Bashash 2017); 0.7 to 1.2 mg/L (Sudhir 2009); 0.88 mg/L among children with iodine deficiency. (Lin 1991); 0.50\u20131.90 mg/L (Yu 2021). Other studies have found IQ reductions at 1.4 ppm (Zhang 2015); 1.8 ppm (Xu 1994); 1.9 ppm (Xiang 2003a,b); 0.3-3.0 ppm (Ding 2011); 2.0 ppm (Yao 1996, 1997); 2.1 ppm (Das 2016); 2.1-3.2 ppm (An 1992); 2.2 ppm (Choi 2015); 2.3 ppm (Trivedi 2012); 2.38 ppm (Poureslami 2011); 2.4-3.5 ppm (Nagarajappa 2013); 2.45 ppm (Eswar 2011); 2.5 ppm (Seraj 2006); 2.5-3.5 ppm (Shivaprakash 2011); 2.85 ppm (Hong 2001); 2.97 ppm (Wang 2001, Yang 1994); 3.1 ppm (Seraj 2012); 3.15 ppm (Lu 2000); 3.94 ppm (Karimzade 2014); and 4.12 ppm (Zhao 1996).\nAbout a quarter of the IQ studies have provided data on the level of fluoride in the children\u2019s urine, with the majority of these studies reporting that the average urine fluoride level was below 3 mg/L. To put this level in perspective, a study from England found that 5.6% of the adult population in fluoridated areas have urinary fluoride levels exceeding 3 mg/L, and 1.1% have levels exceeding 4 mg/L. (Mansfield 1999). In Canada, Till et al (2018) performed a national survey of urinary fluoride levels of pregnant women in fluoridated and non-fluoridated communities. The fluoride levels of women living with water fluoridation had the same levels as found in the Bashash (2017) study. The U.S. has the same \u201coptimal concentration\u201d of 7 mg/L in their fluoridation schemes as Canada. Although there is an appalling absence of urinary fluoride data among children in the United States, the excess ingestion of fluoride toothpaste among some young children is almost certain to produce urinary fluoride levels that exceed 2 ppm in a portion of the child population.\nThe most recent IQ study from Yu et al. (June 2021) recorded these measurements for the 952 children in their study. The authors noted, \u201cOur study has several strengths. Using four fluoride exposure indicators including water fluoride, urinary fluoride, hair fluoride and nail fluoride, which reflect the external and internal, and short-term and long-term exposures, makes the evaluation of fluoride exposures more comprehensive and reliable. Besides, due to the relatively rare studies on low-to-moderate level fluoride exposure in hair and nail, our results also enrich the epidemiological evidence across different fluoride indicators and levels.\u201d\nIn the Mother-Offspring studies by Green 2019, Bashash 2017, Valdez Jim\u00e9nez 2017, and Li 2004, the authors evaluated the association of in utero exposure to fluoride on the offspring. Fluoride exposure was determined through urine analysis during the pregnancy and the levels were paired with cognitive testing of the offspring at various ages up to 12 years. Thomas et al. (2018) also performed this study finding an effect, however it is only available as an abstract, and it hasn\u2019t yet been added to the list of IQ studies.\nAs both the NRC and Harvard reviews have correctly pointed out, many of the fluoride/IQ studies have used relatively simple designs and have failed to adequately control for all of the factors that can impact a child\u2019s intelligence (e.g., parental education, socioeconomic status, lead and arsenic exposure). For several reasons, however, it is unlikely that these limitations can explain the association between fluoride and IQ.\nFirst, some of the fluoride/IQ studies have controlled for the key relevant factors, and significant associations between fluoride and reduced IQ were still observed. This fact was confirmed in the Harvard review, which reported that the association between fluoride and IQ remains significant when considering only those studies that controlled for certain key factors (e.g., arsenic, iodine, etc). Indeed, the four studies that controlled for the largest number of factors (Green 2019; Bashash 2017; Rocha Amador 2007; Xiang 2003a,b) reported some of the largest associations between fluoride and IQ to date.\nSecond, the association between fluoride and reduced IQ in children is predicted by, and entirely consistent with, a large body of other evidence. Other human studies, for example, have found associations between fluoride, cognition, and neurobehavior in ways consistent with fluoride being a neurotoxin. In addition, animal studies have repeatedly found that fluoride impairs the learning and memory capacity of rats under carefully controlled laboratory conditions.

The new edition contains more than 400 references and 10 new Q&A\u2019s for a total of 69 covered over 114 pages.\nIn an ongoing series, the ADA News is delving into many questions explored in the book through conversations with experts about fluoridation information and misinformation \u2014 from overall effectiveness to whether ingesting fluoride impacts IQ, health and reproduction.\nCatherine Hayes, D.M.D., chair of the department of oral health policy and epidemiology at Harvard School of Dental Medicine, discussed whether fluoridated water causes osteosarcoma \u2014 question #33 in \"Fluoridation Facts.\"\nThe question of whether fluoridated water causes osteosarcoma, a form of bone cancer, gained traction in the 1990\u2019s when researchers, while looking at osteosarcoma, gave rats in a study exceptionally high levels of fluoride. While researchers considered the evidence to be equivocal, Dr. Hayes said, they did find a slightly higher incidence of bone cancer in those particular rats.\nAn exploratory analysis from 2006 found an increased risk for osteosarcoma in boys aged 7 exposed to fluoridated drinking water, but not consistently for girls, the ADA said. This prompted a case control study co-authored by Dr. Hayes that analyzed fluoride levels in bone samples from 137 human patients with primary osteosarcoma and bone samples from 51 patients with other malignant bone tumors who served as the control group.\n\u201cWhat was found is that there was no difference in bone fluoride concentrations in the people who had the osteosarcoma versus those who did not. And that was pretty significant because no one had really ever done that before,\u201d Dr. Hayes said.\nShe noted that researchers examined patients\u2019 residential histories and fluoride supplements. They conducted an analysis on individuals who lived in fluoridated communities versus those who did not, and found there was no difference in osteosarcoma risk. Dr. Hayes also added that osteosarcoma is already a very rare form of cancer.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence whatsoever to suggest that fluoridated water causes osteosarcoma. If it did, we would see much higher levels of osteosarcoma in the country,\u201d she said.\nFor more information on this free resource, visit ADA.org/FluoridationFacts.\nGame Changer: AI-Driven Matchmaking for Practice Transitions\nElevate your career, your life and your momentum with resources and benefits from the nation\u2019s leading dental association\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Of these investigations, 69 studies have found that elevated fluoride exposure is associated with reduced IQ in humans, while over 60 animal studies have found that fluoride exposure impairs the learning and/or memory capacity of animals. The human studies, which are based on IQ examinations of 26,142 children (67 studies) and 245 adults (2 studies), provide compelling evidence that fluoride exposure during the early years of life can damage a child\u2019s developing brain.\nAfter reviewing 27 of the human IQ studies, a team of Harvard scientists concluded that fluoride\u2019s effect on the young brain should now be a \u201chigh research priority.\u201d (Choi, et al 2012). Other reviewers have reached similar conclusions, including the prestigious National Research Council (NRC), and scientists in the Neurotoxicology Division of the Environmental Protection Agency (Mundy, et al). In the list of the IQ studies, we summarize the results from the 69 studies that have found associations between fluoride and reduced IQ and provide links to the abstracts or full-text copies, whe available, of the studies.\nFor a discussion of the 8 studies that did not find an association between fluoride and IQ, click here.\nIQ reductions have been significantly associated with fluoride levels of just 0.7 mg/L (Green 2019); 0.15 to 1.38 mg/L (Bashash 2017); 0.7 to 1.2 mg/L (Sudhir 2009); 0.88 mg/L among children with iodine deficiency. (Lin 1991); 0.50\u20131.90 mg/L (Yu 2021). Other studies have found IQ reductions at 1.4 ppm (Zhang 2015); 1.8 ppm (Xu 1994); 1.9 ppm (Xiang 2003a,b); 0.3-3.0 ppm (Ding 2011); 2.0 ppm (Yao 1996, 1997); 2.1 ppm (Das 2016); 2.1-3.2 ppm (An 1992); 2.2 ppm (Choi 2015); 2.3 ppm (Trivedi 2012); 2.38 ppm (Poureslami 2011); 2.4-3.5 ppm (Nagarajappa 2013); 2.45 ppm (Eswar 2011); 2.5 ppm (Seraj 2006); 2.5-3.5 ppm (Shivaprakash 2011); 2.85 ppm (Hong 2001); 2.97 ppm (Wang 2001, Yang 1994); 3.1 ppm (Seraj 2012); 3.15 ppm (Lu 2000); 3.94 ppm (Karimzade 2014); and 4.12 ppm (Zhao 1996).\nAbout a quarter of the IQ studies have provided data on the level of fluoride in the children\u2019s urine, with the majority of these studies reporting that the average urine fluoride level was below 3 mg/L. To put this level in perspective, a study from England found that 5.6% of the adult population in fluoridated areas have urinary fluoride levels exceeding 3 mg/L, and 1.1% have levels exceeding 4 mg/L. (Mansfield 1999). In Canada, Till et al (2018) performed a national survey of urinary fluoride levels of pregnant women in fluoridated and non-fluoridated communities. The fluoride levels of women living with water fluoridation had the same levels as found in the Bashash (2017) study. The U.S. has the same \u201coptimal concentration\u201d of 7 mg/L in their fluoridation schemes as Canada. Although there is an appalling absence of urinary fluoride data among children in the United States, the excess ingestion of fluoride toothpaste among some young children is almost certain to produce urinary fluoride levels that exceed 2 ppm in a portion of the child population.\nThe most recent IQ study from Yu et al. (June 2021) recorded these measurements for the 952 children in their study. The authors noted, \u201cOur study has several strengths. Using four fluoride exposure indicators including water fluoride, urinary fluoride, hair fluoride and nail fluoride, which reflect the external and internal, and short-term and long-term exposures, makes the evaluation of fluoride exposures more comprehensive and reliable. Besides, due to the relatively rare studies on low-to-moderate level fluoride exposure in hair and nail, our results also enrich the epidemiological evidence across different fluoride indicators and levels.\u201d\nIn the Mother-Offspring studies by Green 2019, Bashash 2017, Valdez Jim\u00e9nez 2017, and Li 2004, the authors evaluated the association of in utero exposure to fluoride on the offspring. Fluoride exposure was determined through urine analysis during the pregnancy and the levels were paired with cognitive testing of the offspring at various ages up to 12 years. Thomas et al. (2018) also performed this study finding an effect, however it is only available as an abstract, and it hasn\u2019t yet been added to the list of IQ studies.\nAs both the NRC and Harvard reviews have correctly pointed out, many of the fluoride/IQ studies have used relatively simple designs and have failed to adequately control for all of the factors that can impact a child\u2019s intelligence (e.g., parental education, socioeconomic status, lead and arsenic exposure). For several reasons, however, it is unlikely that these limitations can explain the association between fluoride and IQ.\nFirst, some of the fluoride/IQ studies have controlled for the key relevant factors, and significant associations between fluoride and reduced IQ were still observed. This fact was confirmed in the Harvard review, which reported that the association between fluoride and IQ remains significant when considering only those studies that controlled for certain key factors (e.g., arsenic, iodine, etc). Indeed, the four studies that controlled for the largest number of factors (Green 2019; Bashash 2017; Rocha Amador 2007; Xiang 2003a,b) reported some of the largest associations between fluoride and IQ to date.\nSecond, the association between fluoride and reduced IQ in children is predicted by, and entirely consistent with, a large body of other evidence. Other human studies, for example, have found associations between fluoride, cognition, and neurobehavior in ways consistent with fluoride being a neurotoxin. In addition, animal studies have repeatedly found that fluoride impairs the learning and memory capacity of rats under carefully controlled laboratory conditions. An even larger body of animal resear\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Of these investigations, 69 studies have found that elevated fluoride exposure is associated with reduced IQ in humans, while over 60 animal studies have found that fluoride exposure impairs the learning and/or memory capacity of animals. The human studies, which are based on IQ examinations of 26,142 children (67 studies) and 245 adults (2 studies), provide compelling evidence that fluoride exposure during the early years of life can damage a child\u2019s developing brain.\nAfter reviewing 27 of the human IQ studies, a team of Harvard scientists concluded that fluoride\u2019s effect on the young brain should now be a \u201chigh research priority.\u201d (Choi, et al 2012). Other reviewers have reached similar conclusions, including the prestigious National Research Council (NRC), and scientists in the Neurotoxicology Division of the Environmental Protection Agency (Mundy, et al). In the list of the IQ studies, we summarize the results from the 69 studies that have found associations between fluoride and reduced IQ and provide links to the abstracts or full-text copies, whe available, of the studies.\nFor a discussion of the 8 studies that did not find an association between fluoride and IQ, click here.\nIQ reductions have been significantly associated with fluoride levels of just 0.7 mg/L (Green 2019); 0.15 to 1.38 mg/L (Bashash 2017); 0.7 to 1.2 mg/L (Sudhir 2009); 0.88 mg/L among children with iodine deficiency. (Lin 1991); 0.50\u20131.90 mg/L (Yu 2021). Other studies have found IQ reductions at 1.4 ppm (Zhang 2015); 1.8 ppm (Xu 1994); 1.9 ppm (Xiang 2003a,b); 0.3-3.0 ppm (Ding 2011); 2.0 ppm (Yao 1996, 1997); 2.1 ppm (Das 2016); 2.1-3.2 ppm (An 1992); 2.2 ppm (Choi 2015); 2.3 ppm (Trivedi 2012); 2.38 ppm (Poureslami 2011); 2.4-3.5 ppm (Nagarajappa 2013); 2.45 ppm (Eswar 2011); 2.5 ppm (Seraj 2006); 2.5-3.5 ppm (Shivaprakash 2011); 2.85 ppm (Hong 2001); 2.97 ppm (Wang 2001, Yang 1994); 3.1 ppm (Seraj 2012); 3.15 ppm (Lu 2000); 3.94 ppm (Karimzade 2014); and 4.12 ppm (Zhao 1996).\nAbout a quarter of the IQ studies have provided data on the level of fluoride in the children\u2019s urine, with the majority of these studies reporting that the average urine fluoride level was below 3 mg/L. To put this level in perspective, a study from England found that 5.6% of the adult population in fluoridated areas have urinary fluoride levels exceeding 3 mg/L, and 1.1% have levels exceeding 4 mg/L. (Mansfield 1999). In Canada, Till et al (2018) performed a national survey of urinary fluoride levels of pregnant women in fluoridated and non-fluoridated communities. The fluoride levels of women living with water fluoridation had the same levels as found in the Bashash (2017) study. The U.S. has the same \u201coptimal concentration\u201d of 7 mg/L in their fluoridation schemes as Canada. Although there is an appalling absence of urinary fluoride data among children in the United States, the excess ingestion of fluoride toothpaste among some young children is almost certain to produce urinary fluoride levels that exceed 2 ppm in a portion of the child population.\nThe most recent IQ study from Yu et al. (June 2021) recorded these measurements for the 952 children in their study. The authors noted, \u201cOur study has several strengths. Using four fluoride exposure indicators including water fluoride, urinary fluoride, hair fluoride and nail fluoride, which reflect the external and internal, and short-term and long-term exposures, makes the evaluation of fluoride exposures more comprehensive and reliable. Besides, due to the relatively rare studies on low-to-moderate level fluoride exposure in hair and nail, our results also enrich the epidemiological evidence across different fluoride indicators and levels.\u201d\nIn the Mother-Offspring studies by Green 2019, Bashash 2017, Valdez Jim\u00e9nez 2017, and Li 2004, the authors evaluated the association of in utero exposure to fluoride on the offspring. Fluoride exposure was determined through urine analysis during the pregnancy and the levels were paired with cognitive testing of the offspring at various ages up to 12 years. Thomas et al. (2018) also performed this study finding an effect, however it is only available as an abstract, and it hasn\u2019t yet been added to the list of IQ studies.\nAs both the NRC and Harvard reviews have correctly pointed out, many of the fluoride/IQ studies have used relatively simple designs and have failed to adequately control for all of the factors that can impact a child\u2019s intelligence (e.g., parental education, socioeconomic status, lead and arsenic exposure). For several reasons, however, it is unlikely that these limitations can explain the association between fluoride and IQ.\nFirst, some of the fluoride/IQ studies have controlled for the key relevant factors, and significant associations between fluoride and reduced IQ were still observed. This fact was confirmed in the Harvard review, which reported that the association between fluoride and IQ remains significant when considering only those studies that controlled for certain key factors (e.g., arsenic, iodine, etc). Indeed, the four studies that controlled for the largest number of factors (Green 2019; Bashash 2017; Rocha Amador 2007; Xiang 2003a,b) reported some of the largest associations between fluoride and IQ to date.\nSecond, the association between fluoride and reduced IQ in children is predicted by, and entirely consistent with, a large body of other evidence. Other human studies, for example, have found associations between fluoride, cognition, and neurobehavior in ways consistent with fluoride being a neurotoxin. In addition, animal studies have repeatedly found that fluoride impairs the learning and memory capacity of rats under carefully controlled laboratory conditions.

The NTP released their findings in a State of the Science Monograph (available below under Documents). A corresponding meta-analysis on children's IQ was published in JAMA Pediatrics on January 6, 2025 (see sidebar).\nThe NTP started this work in 2016. As with all research documents intended for publication, the NTP fluoride monograph and meta-analysis underwent rigorous scientific evaluation. The evaluation process has involved many steps.

It is important to note that there were insufficient data to determine if the low fluoride level of 0.7 mg/L currently recommended for U.S. community water supplies has a negative effect on children\u2019s IQ. The NTP found no evidence that fluoride exposure had adverse effects on adult cognition.\nThe NTP uses 4 confidence levels - high, moderate, low, or very low - to characterize the strength of scientific evidence that associates a particular health outcome with an exposure. After evaluating studies published through October 2023, the NTP Monograph concluded there is moderate confidence in the scientific evidence that showed an association between higher levels of fluoride and lower IQ in children.\nThe determination about lower IQs in children was based primarily on epidemiology studies in non-U.S. countries such as Canada, China, India, Iran, Pakistan, and Mexico where some pregnant women, infants, and children received total fluoride exposure amounts higher than 1.5 mg fluoride/L of drinking water. The U.S. Public Health Service currently recommends 0.7 mg/L, and the World Health Organization has set a safe limit for fluoride in drinking water of 1.5 mg/L.\nAn association indicates a connection between fluoride and lower IQ; it does not prove a cause and effect.

The NTP released their findings in a State of the Science Monograph (available below under Documents). A corresponding meta-analysis on children's IQ was published in JAMA Pediatrics on January 6, 2025 (see sidebar).\nThe NTP started this work in 2016. As with all research documents intended for publication, the NTP fluoride monograph and meta-analysis underwent rigorous scientific evaluation. The evaluation process has involved many steps. The draft fluoride monograph received critical feedback during peer-review by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM), from other external experts, and from experts in several federal health agencies. After modifications were made, additional evaluation following a rigorous scientific framework was conducted by subject matter experts organized by the NTP Board of Scientific Counselors. This document is now complete and available for reference.\nThe monograph represents a thorough review of the data, and the various interpretations of the data, to accurately reflect what we know and where additional research is needed.\nThe NTP monograph concluded, with moderate confidence, that higher levels of fluoride exposure, such as drinking water containing more than 1.5 milligrams of fluoride per liter, are associated with lower IQ in children. The NTP review was designed to evaluate total fluoride exposure from all sources and was not designed to evaluate the health effects of fluoridated drinking water alone. It is important to note that there were insufficient data to determine if the low fluoride level of 0.7 mg/L currently recommended for U.S. community water supplies has a negative effect on children\u2019s IQ. The NTP found no evidence that fluoride exposure had adverse effects on adult cognition.\nThe NTP uses 4 confidence levels - high, moderate, low, or very low - to characterize the strength of scientific evidence that associates a particular health outcome with an exposure. After evaluating studies published through October 2023, the NTP Monograph concluded there is moderate confidence in the scientific evidence that showed an association between higher levels of fluoride and lower IQ in children.\nThe determination about lower IQs in children was based primarily on epidemiology studies in non-U.S. countries such as Canada, China, India, Iran, Pakistan, and Mexico where some pregnant women, infants, and children received total fluoride exposure amounts higher than 1.5 mg fluoride/L of drinking water. The U.S. Public Health Service currently recommends 0.7 mg/L, and the World Health Organization has set a safe limit for fluoride in drinking water of 1.5 mg/L.\nAn association indicates a connection between fluoride and lower IQ; it does not prove a cause and effect. Many substances are healthy and beneficial when taken in small doses but may cause harm at high doses. More research is needed to better understand if there are health risks associated with low fluoride exposures. This NTP monograph may provide important information to regulatory agencies that set standards for the safe use of fluoride. It does not, and was not intended to, assess the benefits of fluoride.\nBoard of Scientific Counselors - BSC Meeting\nBoard of Scientific Counselors - BSC Meeting\nExpert Panels - Other Panels\nExpert Panels - Other Panels\nBoard of Scientific Counselors - BSC Meeting\nSupplemental materials for some events, meetings, and workshops prior to 2021 have been archived.
