And what if I told you that same thing could actually last a long time and protect your brain from different conditions like depression, Alzheimer's disease or dementia. Would you do it? Yes! I am talking about the powerful effects of physical activity. Simply moving your body, has immediate, long-lasting and protective benefits for your brain. And that can last for the rest of your life. So what I want to do today is tell you a story about how I used my deep understanding of neuroscience, as a professor of neuroscience, to essentially do an experiment on myself in which I discovered the science underlying why exercise is the most transformative thing that you can do for your brain today. Now, as a neuroscientist, I know that our brains, that is the thing in our head right now, that is the most complex structure known to humankind. But it's one thing to talk about the brain, and it's another to see it. So here is a real preserved human brain. And it's going to illustrate two key areas that we are going to talk about today. The first is the prefrontal cortex, right behind your forehead, critical for things like decision-making, focus, attention and your personality. The second key area is located in the temporal lobe, shown right here. You have two temporal lobes in your brain, the right and the left, and deep in the temporal lobe is a key structure critical for your ability to form and retain new long-term memories for facts and events. And that structure is called the hippocampus. So I've always been fascinated with the hippocampus. How could it be that an event that lasts just a moment, say, your first kiss, or the moment your first child was born, can form a memory that has changed your brain, that lasts an entire lifetime? That's what I want to understand. I wanted to start and record the activity of individual brain cells in the hippocampus as subjects were forming new memories. And essentially try and decode how those brief bursts of electrical activity, which is how neurons communicate with each other, how those brief bursts either allowed us to form a new memory, or did not. But a few years ago, I did something very unusual in science. As a full professor of neural science, I decided to completely switch my research program. Because I encountered something that was so amazing, with the potential to change so many lives that I had to study it. I discovered and I experienced the brain-changing effects of exercise. And I did it in a completely inadvertent way. I was actually at the height of all the memory work that I was doing -- data was pouring in, I was becoming known in my field for all of this memory work. And it should have been going great. It was, scientifically. But when I stuck my head out of my lab door, I noticed something. I had no social life. I spent too much time listening to those brain cells in a dark room, by myself. (Laughter) I didn't move my body at all. I had gained 25 pounds. And actually, it took me many years to realize it, I was actually miserable. And I shouldn't be miserable. And I went on a river-rafting trip -- by myself, because I had no social life. And I came back -- (Laughter) thinking, \"Oh, my God, I was the weakest person on that trip.\" And I came back with a mission. I said, \"I'm never going to feel like the weakest person on a river-rafting trip again.\" And that's what made me go to the gym. And I focused my type-A personality on going to all the exercise classes at the gym. I tried everything. I went to kickbox, dance, yoga, step class, and at first it was really hard. But what I noticed is that after every sweat-inducing workout that I tried, I had this great mood boost and this great energy boost. And that's what kept me going back to the gym. Well, I started feeling stronger. I started feeling better, I even lost that 25 pounds. And now, fast-forward a year and a half into this regular exercise program and I noticed something that really made me sit up and take notice. I was sitting at my desk, writing a research grant, and a thought went through my mind that had never gone through my mind before. And that thought was, \"Gee, grant-writing is going well today.\" And all the scientists -- (Laughter) yeah, all the scientists always laugh when I say that, because grant-writing never goes well. It is so hard; you're always pulling your hair out, trying to come up with that million-dollar-winning idea. But I realized that the grant-writing was going well, because I was able to focus and maintain my attention for longer than I had before. And my long-term memory -- what I was studying in my own lab -- seemed to be better in me. And that's when I put it together. Maybe all that exercise that I had included and added to my life was changing my brain. Maybe I did an experiment on myself without even knowing it. So as a curious neuroscientist, I went to the literature to see what I could find about what we knew about the effects of exercise on the brain. And what I found was an exciting and a growing literature that was essentially showing everything that I noticed in myself. Better mood, better energy, better memory, better attention. And the more I learned, the more I realized how powerful exercise was. Which eventually led me to the big decision to completely shift my research focus. And so now, after several years of really focusing on this question, I've come to the following conclusion: that exercise is the most transformative thing that you can do for your brain today for the following three reasons. Number one: it has immediate effects on your brain. A single workout that you do will immediately increase levels of neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline. That is going to increase your mood right after that workout, exactly what I was feeling. My lab showed that a single workout can improve your ability to shift and focus attention, and that focus improvement will last for at least two hours. And finally, studies have shown that a single workout will improve your reaction times which basically means that you are going to be faster at catching that cup of Starbucks that falls off the counter, which is very, very important. (Laughter) But these immediate effects are transient, they help you right after. What you have to do is do what I did, that is change your exercise regime, increase your cardiorespiratory function, to get the long-lasting effects. And these effects are long-lasting because exercise actually changes the brain's anatomy, physiology and function. Let's start with my favorite brain area, the hippocampus. The hippocampus -- or exercise actually produces brand new brain cells, new brain cells in the hippocampus, that actually increase its volume, as well as improve your long-term memory, OK? And that including in you and me. Number two: the most common finding in neuroscience studies, looking at effects of long-term exercise, is improved attention function dependent on your prefrontal cortex. You not only get better focus and attention, but the volume of the hippocampus increases as well. And finally, you not only get immediate effects of mood with exercise but those last for a long time. So you get long-lasting increases in those good mood neurotransmitters. But really, the most transformative thing that exercise will do is its protective effects on your brain. Here you can think about the brain like a muscle. The more you're working out, the bigger and stronger your hippocampus and prefrontal cortex gets. Why is that important? Because the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus are the two areas that are most susceptible to neurodegenerative diseases and normal cognitive decline in aging. So with increased exercise over your lifetime, you're not going to cure dementia or Alzheimer's disease, but what you're going to do is you're going to create the strongest, biggest hippocampus and prefrontal cortex so it takes longer for these diseases to actually have an effect. You can think of exercise, therefore, as a supercharged 401K for your brain, OK? And it's even better, because it's free. So this is the point in the talk where everybody says, \"That sounds so interesting, Wendy, but I really will only want to know one thing. And that is, just tell me the minimum amount of exercise I need to get all these changes.\" (Laughter) And so I'm going to tell you the answer to that question. First, good news: you don't have to become a triathlete to get these effects. The rule of thumb is you want to get three to four times a week exercise minimum 30 minutes an exercise session, and you want to get aerobic exercise in. That is, get your heart rate up. And the good news is, you don't have to go to the gym to get a very expensive gym membership. Add an extra walk around the block in your power walk. You see stairs -- take stairs. And power-vacuuming can be as good as the aerobics class that you were going to take at the gym. So I've gone from memory pioneer to exercise explorer. From going into the innermost workings of the brain, to trying to understand how exercise can improve our brain function, and my goal in my lab right now is to go beyond that rule of thumb that I just gave you -- three to four times a week, 30 minutes. I want to understand the optimum exercise prescription for you, at your age, at your fitness level, for your genetic background, to maximize the effects of exercise today and also to improve your brain and protect your brain the best for the rest of your life. But it's one thing to talk about exercise, and it's another to do it. So I'm going to invoke my power as a certified exercise instructor, to ask you all to stand up. (Laughter) We're going to do just one minute of exercise. It's call-and-response, just do what I do, say what I say, and make sure you don't punch your neighbor, OK? Music! (Upbeat music) Five, six, seven, eight, it's right, left, right, left. And I say, I am strong now. Let's hear you. Audience: I am strong now. Wendy Suzuki: Ladies, I am Wonder Woman-strong. Let's hear you! Audience: I am Wonder Woman-strong. WS: New move -- uppercut, right and left. I am inspired now. You say it! Audience: I am inspired now. WS: Last move -- pull it down, right and left, right and left. I say, I am on fire now! You say it. Audience: I am on fire now. WS: And done! OK, good job! (Applause) Thank you. I want to leave you with one last thought. And that is, bringing exercise in your life will not only give you a happier, more protective life today, but it will protect your brain from incurable diseases. And in this way it will change the trajectory of your life for the better. Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)",

Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of dementia, is by no means an inevitable consequence of growing old. Several lifestyle factors may increase, or reduce, an individual's risk of developing AD. Much has been written over the ages about the benefits of exercise and physical activity. Among the risk factors associated with AD is a low level of physical activity. The relationship between physical and mental health was established several years ago. In this review, we discuss the role of exercise (aerobic and resistance) training as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment and prevention of AD. Older adults who exercise are more likely to maintain cognition. We address the main protective mechanism on brain function modulated by physical exercise by examining both human and animal studies. We will pay especial attention to the potential role of exercise in the modulation of amyloid \u03b2 turnover, inflammation, synthesis and release of neurotrophins, and improvements in cerebral blood flow. Promoting changes in lifestyle in presymptomatic and predementia disease stages may have the potential for delaying one-third of dementias worldwide. Multimodal interventions that include the adoption of an active lifestyle should be recommended for older populations.\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia and one of the most frequent neurodegenerative pathologies in elderly people, constituting about 90% of the cases of dementia in this population. AD is characterized by its irreversibility and progressive functional, cognitive, and behavioral loss. It is usually accompanied by various brain disorders such as amnesia, agnosia, apraxia, and aphasia.1\nTwenty-four million people in the world suffer from AD, and it is expected that by 2050 this number will be 4 times greater.2 These alarming numbers are explained by the fact that the main risk factor for this disease is age,3 and by 2050 it is estimated that the population over 65 years will be 3 times larger than it was in 2010, reaching close to 1.5 billion people.\nAD is a devastating disease. The social and human cost for patients and caregivers is overwhelming, and the economic cost of AD is unaffordable. For instance, in the United States in 2017, the annual cost of care per patient over 65 with AD or another type of dementia was USD 48,000, or 3.5 times more than for a person without any type of dementia.4,5\nAD is characterized by the loss of neuronal synapses and pyramidal neurons accompanied by progressive cognitive neurodegeneration.6 The regions associated with more complex brain functions, such as the hippocampus and the neocortex, are the most affected.\nAlthough there are several hypotheses to explain the origin of AD, the 2 main neuropathological features include the extracellular accumulation of senile plaques around the neurons and the glia, and the intracellular formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Senile plaques are formed mainly by the accumulation of insoluble amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) protein, especially its isoform A\u03b242, which is formed by the enzymatic cleavage of the transmembrane amyloid precursor protein (APP).7,8 NFTs are formed from the hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein. The main function of this protein is to stabilize the microtubules so that they connect with other elements of the neuronal cytoskeleton, such as neurofilaments and actin.9\nAnother feature in AD is the inflammatory response at the brain level. In the early stages of the disease, the immune response results in a removal of A\u03b2, ameliorating its symptoms.10,11 To generate a balance between the deposition and the clearance of A\u03b2, microglia plays a fundamental role by engulfing insoluble deposits of this peptide through the activation of receptors that promote phagocytic action, such as cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36), and receptors for advanced-glycosylation end products.12,13 Microglia also activates extracellular proteases such as neprilysin, the insulin degrading enzyme, endothelin converting enzyme 1, angiotensin converting enzyme, matrix metalloprotease, and the presequence peptidase.14, 15, 16 During advanced stages of the disease there is a prolonged stimulation of the immune response caused by A\u03b2, which leads to a decrease in the efficiency of the microglia to degrade it.17 In turn, this leads to the release of several proinflammatory products, such as cytokines, reactive oxygen, and nitrogen species, leading to an increase in the production of A\u03b2 and the hyperphosphorylation of tau, generating more damage and neuronal death.18, 19, 20 This state contributes to an increase in cognitive decline and the development of the disease.\nThe risk factors associated with AD, apart from age, are low educational level, diabetes, genetics, belonging to certain minority ethnic groups (prevalence of dementia is higher in British African\u2013Caribbean people),21 diet, previous brain injuries, sleep disorders, hypertension, hearing loss, and low levels of physical activity.22 Physical activity (\u201cany movement of the body\u201d) and exercise (\u201cphysical activity that is typified by specific and purposeful training\u201d) constitute 2 different concepts.23 However, for the sake of clarity we refer to both these concepts interchangeably since some of the reports we refer to in this review use these expressions as synonyms.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of dementia, is by no means an inevitable consequence of growing old. Several lifestyle factors may increase, or reduce, an individual's risk of developing AD. Much has been written over the ages about the benefits of exercise and physical activity. Among the risk factors associated with AD is a low level of physical activity. The relationship between physical and mental health was established several years ago. In this review, we discuss the role of exercise (aerobic and resistance) training as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment and prevention of AD. Older adults who exercise are more likely to maintain cognition. We address the main protective mechanism on brain function modulated by physical exercise by examining both human and animal studies. We will pay especial attention to the potential role of exercise in the modulation of amyloid \u03b2 turnover, inflammation, synthesis and release of neurotrophins, and improvements in cerebral blood flow. Promoting changes in lifestyle in presymptomatic and predementia disease stages may have the potential for delaying one-third of dementias worldwide. Multimodal interventions that include the adoption of an active lifestyle should be recommended for older populations.\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia and one of the most frequent neurodegenerative pathologies in elderly people, constituting about 90% of the cases of dementia in this population. AD is characterized by its irreversibility and progressive functional, cognitive, and behavioral loss. It is usually accompanied by various brain disorders such as amnesia, agnosia, apraxia, and aphasia.1\nTwenty-four million people in the world suffer from AD, and it is expected that by 2050 this number will be 4 times greater.2 These alarming numbers are explained by the fact that the main risk factor for this disease is age,3 and by 2050 it is estimated that the population over 65 years will be 3 times larger than it was in 2010, reaching close to 1.5 billion people.\nAD is a devastating disease. The social and human cost for patients and caregivers is overwhelming, and the economic cost of AD is unaffordable. For instance, in the United States in 2017, the annual cost of care per patient over 65 with AD or another type of dementia was USD 48,000, or 3.5 times more than for a person without any type of dementia.4,5\nAD is characterized by the loss of neuronal synapses and pyramidal neurons accompanied by progressive cognitive neurodegeneration.6 The regions associated with more complex brain functions, such as the hippocampus and the neocortex, are the most affected.\nAlthough there are several hypotheses to explain the origin of AD, the 2 main neuropathological features include the extracellular accumulation of senile plaques around the neurons and the glia, and the intracellular formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Senile plaques are formed mainly by the accumulation of insoluble amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) protein, especially its isoform A\u03b242, which is formed by the enzymatic cleavage of the transmembrane amyloid precursor protein (APP).7,8 NFTs are formed from the hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein.

Exercise can increase the production of endorphins, which are neurotransmitters associated with a positive mood and feelings of well-being. Exercise improves sleep, reduces stress and anxiety, and enhances self-esteem and social support. The implications of exercise as a treatment for depression are significant because depression is a common and debilitating mental health condition. Exercise is a low-cost, accessible, and effective treatment option that can be implemented in various settings such as primary care, mental health clinics, and community-based programs. Exercise can also be used as an adjunctive treatment along with medication and psychotherapy, which can enhance treatment outcomes.\nKeywords: physiological effects, inflammation, depression, endorphins, social interaction, neurotransmitters\nDepression is a prevalent mental health disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. The World Health Organization identifies it as the primary cause of disability worldwide, affecting over 264 million individuals. This condition can lead to enduring feelings of sadness and diminished interest in activities, significantly influencing an individual\u2019s daily life and overall well-being [1]. Modern treatment approaches for depression often involve psychotherapy, antidepressant medications, or a combination of these methods. Psychotherapies, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), target the modification of negative thought patterns and behaviors that play a role in depression. Antidepressant drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), work by adjusting the brain chemicals that influence mood and emotions. However, these methods have limitations. Psychotherapy can be time-consuming and expensive, and not all individuals have access to qualified therapists. The term \u2018qualified therapist\u2019 typically refers to a professional with specific credentials and training in psychotherapy. These qualifications often include advanced degrees in psychology, counseling, social work, or a related field, along with licensure or certification from relevant professional boards or organizations. Additionally, ongoing professional development and adherence to ethical guidelines are essential for maintaining one\u2019s status as a qualified therapist. Antidepressant medications may have side effects, take several weeks to show effect, and may not be effective for everyone. Moreover, the high cost of medication and the risk of addiction and dependency are concerns associated with antidepressant medication [2]. Millions of individuals worldwide suffer from depression, a common mental health condition that makes them feel low and uninterested in their activities. Current forms of treatment for depression such as psychotherapy and antidepressant drugs have drawbacks in terms of cost, accessibility, side effects, and different levels of efficacy. Therefore, investigating alternative methods for managing depression is required. Exercise is one such strategy that has shown promise in reducing depression symptoms. Numerous pathways, including neurobiological modifications, psychological advantages, behavioral activation, and sleep regulation, play a role in the effect of exercise on depression. Healthcare providers should develop focused exercise treatments to improve treatment results and general mental health by studying the effects of exercise on depression.\nSelf-reported mental health signs in young adults.\nAs per the \u2018SANDSTONE CARE Mental Health Statistics 2023\u2019, 50% of young adults, the highest among all age groups surveyed, reported the highest severity level (5) for mental illness risk, as indicated by self-reports and assessments by loved ones. Notably, 88.57% of the young adults surpassed the treatment threshold, exhibiting three or more of the five signs of mental distress. Furthermore, studies have highlighted that young adults engage in the highest level of substance abuse as a coping mechanism, a trend consistent with addiction risk factors. An exclusive survey on substance abuse aligned with this finding, revealing that young adults self-reported the highest substance use issues (4.94 out of 6). Parents and loved ones, more than any other group, observed mood-altering substance use, underscoring the critical link between substance abuse and mental health.\nExercise is an appealing supplementary therapy for patients with depression.

The World Health Organization identifies it as the primary cause of disability worldwide, affecting over 264 million individuals. This condition can lead to enduring feelings of sadness and diminished interest in activities, significantly influencing an individual\u2019s daily life and overall well-being [1]. Modern treatment approaches for depression often involve psychotherapy, antidepressant medications, or a combination of these methods. Psychotherapies, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), target the modification of negative thought patterns and behaviors that play a role in depression. Antidepressant drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), work by adjusting the brain chemicals that influence mood and emotions. However, these methods have limitations. Psychotherapy can be time-consuming and expensive, and not all individuals have access to qualified therapists. The term \u2018qualified therapist\u2019 typically refers to a professional with specific credentials and training in psychotherapy. These qualifications often include advanced degrees in psychology, counseling, social work, or a related field, along with licensure or certification from relevant professional boards or organizations. Additionally, ongoing professional development and adherence to ethical guidelines are essential for maintaining one\u2019s status as a qualified therapist. Antidepressant medications may have side effects, take several weeks to show effect, and may not be effective for everyone. Moreover, the high cost of medication and the risk of addiction and dependency are concerns associated with antidepressant medication [2]. Millions of individuals worldwide suffer from depression, a common mental health condition that makes them feel low and uninterested in their activities. Current forms of treatment for depression such as psychotherapy and antidepressant drugs have drawbacks in terms of cost, accessibility, side effects, and different levels of efficacy. Therefore, investigating alternative methods for managing depression is required. Exercise is one such strategy that has shown promise in reducing depression symptoms. Numerous pathways, including neurobiological modifications, psychological advantages, behavioral activation, and sleep regulation, play a role in the effect of exercise on depression. Healthcare providers should develop focused exercise treatments to improve treatment results and general mental health by studying the effects of exercise on depression.\nSelf-reported mental health signs in young adults.\nAs per the \u2018SANDSTONE CARE Mental Health Statistics 2023\u2019, 50% of young adults, the highest among all age groups surveyed, reported the highest severity level (5) for mental illness risk, as indicated by self-reports and assessments by loved ones. Notably, 88.57% of the young adults surpassed the treatment threshold, exhibiting three or more of the five signs of mental distress. Furthermore, studies have highlighted that young adults engage in the highest level of substance abuse as a coping mechanism, a trend consistent with addiction risk factors.
