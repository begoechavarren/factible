    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nWhat you\u2019re about to see\u2026 is a historic moment. [TRUMP]: \u201c...we're very much working very closely with China and president Xi.\u201d [HOST]: Not that. [TRUMP]:\u201d...if you look at Idlib Province in Syria.\u201d [HOST]: Nope [TRUMP]:\u201cSo, Prime Minister Abe came here\u2026\u201d [HOST]: Not that either... But this... [TRUMP]: \u201cI'm going to be signing a national emergency. And it's been signed many times before. It's been signed by other presidents. There's rarely been a problem. They sign it; nobody cares. ..\u201d [HOST]: President Trump is right, many other presidents have used this power before. But his declaration isn\u2019t normal. At all. Why? Because by using it to fund his proposed border wall, he has made it the first time a president has used this power to pay for policy that had already been rejected by Congress. [GOITEIN]: \u201cThis this is an unprecedented abuse of power in terms of the president basically saying that Congress cannot limit him.\u201d [HOST]: That\u2019s Elizabeth Goitein from the Brennan Center for Justices. She\u2019s extensively studied presidential declarations of National Emergencies. And she\u2019ll help us better understand what\u2019s different about Trump\u2019s declaration. Let's start here, in December 2018: [TRUMP]: \u201cI am proud to shutdown the government for border security, Chuck. \u2026 I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I\u2019m not going to blame you for it.\u201d [HOST]: Trump said he would refuse to sign a budget into law unless it included $5.7 billion dollars for his proposed border wall on the U.S. / Mexico border. Democrats, who took control of the House of Representatives in January, refused to give in to the president\u2019s demand. The result\u2026 a political stalemate and the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. Eventually, on February 14th, a budget was passed\u2026 but it did not include funding for the border wall. That\u2019s when Trump decided to take executive action to fund his border wall by declaring a \u201cnational emergency.\u201d [GOITEIN]: This president is pushing a very dangerous vision of constitutional government where the president gets to do what he wants. And that's not what the Constitution provides for. This is dangerous. It's undemocratic. [HOST]: The declaration allows the president to unilaterally divert billions of dollars from military construction projects to fund this border wall. But now, Trump\u2019s declaration is being challenged in the courts and Congress. In a historic vote on February 26th, the House of Representatives voted to block a presidential national emergency for the first time ever. The legislation now moves to the Senate. [GOITEIN]: I think it's has a good chance of passing the Senate. At that point of course the president would veto it and then the chances are overriding that veto are slim to be sure. [HOST]: That\u2019s because Congress would need a supermajority vote, two-thirds of both chambers, to override a presidential veto. And since some say it\u2019s unlikely that it will be blocked by Congress, it will be left up to the courts to determine whether it\u2019s legal or not. Right now, 16 states are suing the president for what they say is an \u201cunconstitutional\u201d use of executive power. The lawsuit claims the president has used a \u201cmanufactured crisis\u201d to call for an emergency. [GOITEIN]: \u201cIn this case it's very clear from the president's words and his actions that he is declaring this emergency for the purpose of getting around Congress\u2026 That's an abuse of power. [HOST]: What Goitein is saying there\u2026 isn\u2019t really controversial. In fact, the president even made this point himself in the very same speech where he first announced his declaration. [TRUMP]: \u201cI could do the wall over a longer period of time, I didn't need to do this, but I'd rather do it much faster.\u201d [HOST]: But let\u2019s take a step back. Despite this announcement being the first of its kind, presidential declarations of national emergencies definitely aren\u2019t anything new, or out of the ordinary. For example, in addition to this most recent one, President Trump has declared three others during his time in office. President Obama? He issued 12. Bush? 13. And Clinton? 17. In addition to the recent one, there are 31 other active national emergencies, which need to be renewed every year. The oldest one still in effect is from president Jimmy Carter in 1979 -- which were sanctions in response to the Iran hostage crisis. But when did this type of power first arise? First, it\u2019s important to know that the U.S. Constitution doesn\u2019t explicitly give a president the right to declare a national emergency. But presidents have taken this type of unilateral action for some time now -- claiming it\u2019s part of the \u201cexecutive powers\u201d granted to them in the constitution. President Woodrow Wilson was the first president to declare a national emergency during World War I. Since then, numerous presidents have used this type of executive power -- sometimes in really awful ways. Take Franklin Roosevelt for example\u2026 He used it to order the internment of over 100,000 Japanese-Americans during World War II . But this type of executive power has been successfully blocked too. In the 1950s, the Supreme Court blocked President Harry Truman\u2019s attempt to nationalize the steel industry during the the Korean War. With this type of presidential overreach fresh in the minds of Congress, it took action to scale back executive power in the 1970s. [GOITEIN]: \u201cThere had been several just massive scandals involving executive branch overreach. For example Watergate, the bombing of Cambodia during Vietnam, the CIA's domestic spying programs and all of these things came to light at around the same time. And so Congress just decided to take a very hard look at executive power in general.\u201d [HOST]: It passed the National Emergencies Act of 1976. The legislation formalized a president\u2019s ability to declare national emergencies, but also aimed to give legislators the ability to check the president\u2019s power. But Goitein says since it passed, the law has failed to limit presidential powers the way it intended to. And she argues that if Trump\u2019s recent declaration is allowed to stay in effect, it would set a really dangerous precedent. [GOITEIN]: It is not by any means the scariest of the emergency powers that become available to a president when he declares a national emergency. There are powers that allow the president simply by declaring a national emergency to shut down or take over radio stations. Powers that allow him to freeze Americans bank accounts and criminalize doing business with Americans that are designated by the government. [HOST]: Those examples of potential areas of abuse by a president are why Goiten says Congress needs to act now -- not only to place limits on President Trump\u2019s power, but for those who occupy the office after him as well.",

The Senate, which needs just fourGOP votes to approve it and send it to the president\u2019s desk for his first veto, will vote on theresolution in the coming weeks.\nThe unprecedented vote to block Trump\u2019s emergency order is the first piece of Democrats\u2019 multipronged attempt to halt the president\u2019s unilateral attempt to spend billions of dollars without Congress\u2019 approval, which both parties acknowledge is likely to land in the Supreme Court.\nRepublicans in the House largely fell in line behind Trump, under immense pressure from GOP leaders, White House aides and the president himself.\nStill, Democratic leaders made a last-ditch attempt to shore up GOP support on Tuesday, with dramatic floor speeches that referenced the Founding Fathers and Martin Luther King Jr., to argue against what they called Trump\u2019s unconstitutional power grab.\n\u201cThat\u2019s how despots take power,\u201d House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said on the floor before the vote.\n\u201cFidelity to the president, or fidelity to the Constitution. That is the choice we make today. That is why this is a pivotal moment,\u201d Hoyer declared.\n\u201cWe have a constitutional mission and a mandate to preserve the balance of power and to oppose this monument of hate,\u201d Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), a civil rights icon, said in another fiery floor speech ahead of the vote.\nSome Republicans have echoed similar constitutional concerns. The small House Liberty Caucus \u2014 led by libertarian Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) \u2014 urged support for the measure.\n\u201cThis national emergency declaration does not conform to our constitution,\u201d the group, which has eight members, wrote in a statement.\nIn the Senate, Democrats are inching toward a victory. Just one more GOP supporter is needed to send the measure to Trump\u2019s desk. Congress has never previously voted to overturn a president\u2019s national emergency declaration.\nSo far, three Republican senators \u2014. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Thom Tillis of North Carolina \u2014 have signaled they would support the measure to overturn Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration over border security. Several other Republicans have declined to disclose their plans but have voiced concerns for weeks, putting Trump on the verge of an embarrassing repudiation, even if he can veto the legislation.\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and her deputies have spent weeks pitching the measure as a constitutional duty, rather than as a partisan ploy by newly emboldened Democrats who seem eager to humiliate Trump.\n\u201cThis is the most significant vote that this Congress has taken, probably in a generation, on the balances of powers between the president and Congress,\u201d Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas), who drafted the resolution, told reporters Tuesday before the vote.\nDemocrats are likely to take on the president through the courts; 16 states have launched a legal challenge to block Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration.\nCastro and Democratic leaders have targeted their outreach to Republican lawmakers who have been skeptical of the legality of the president\u2019s action.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s tough for them because many do respect the Constitution, and at the same time, they\u2019re afraid of being out of favor with Donald Trump and getting a primary opponent,\u201d Castro said.\nDemocrats had hoped to win over support from GOP defense hawks, many of whom have privately lashed out at the White House\u2019s plan to raid the Pentagon\u2019s construction budget to fund a border wall. The House\u2019s spending panel had been circulating a list of hundreds of projects from Kentucky to Alaska that could be affected by Trump\u2019s tactics.\nBut most Republicans were unwilling to take a public stand against Trump over legislation that he has said he would \u201c100 percent\u201d veto \u2014 which would be the first of his presidency.\nThe White House threatened the veto on Tuesday afternoon, while offering a preview of its own legal defense. Administration officials argued that the situation on the border is an emergency, citing \u201csharp increases\u201d in the number of families and unaccompanied minors crossing the border in recent years.\nThe number of people apprehended at the southern border rose about 30 percent from 2017 to 2018, including a 40 percent increase in families, according to U.S. customs officials. Both figures are down from 2016 numbers, however.\nWhite House officials also argued that former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama used the same authority for \u201cmore than 18 different military construction projects between 2001 and 2013.\u201d\nCastro acknowledged Tuesday that House Democrats would face an \u201cuphill battle\u201d in overriding Trump\u2019s veto, which would require more than 50 Republicans in the House. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to keep working at it,\u201d Castro said.\nRepublicans, including senior members of the party\u2019s leadership, had been skittish about the White House circumventing Congress to build a border wall even before Trump made the declaration. Many lawmakers said they had hoped he wouldn\u2019t take such a drastic step.\nSeveral acknowledged that backing Trump on the emergency order would amount to hypocrisy after Republicans railed against Obama for his own unilateral actions on immigration as president.\nEven this week, Republicans like Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahomacalled the White House\u2019s move an \u201cunwelcome precedent,\u201d while nonetheless vowing to vote against Democrats on the floor.\nWhite House officials, along with the Department of Defense, have mounted a behind-the-scenes lobbying campaign to ease some GOP lawmakers\u2019 anxiety about the president\u2019s move.\nRep.

It is the first veto Trump has issued during his presidency.\n\nFull Page Content:\nBy\nSusan Davis\nPresident Trump said Thursday he would \"probably have to veto\" the resolution blocking his emergency declaration to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.\nUpdated at 4:16 p.m. ET\nThe Republican-controlled Senate approved a resolution to terminate President Trump's national emergency declaration at the U.S.-Mexico border, putting Congress on a path to its first veto confrontation with the Trump administration.\nShortly after the vote, President Trump tweeted, \"VETO!\" Neither chamber mustered the two-thirds support required to override a presidential veto.\nThe president also tweeted that he looked forward to vetoing the measure, which he called \"Democrat inspired.\"\nBut in Thursday's vote to block the president's emergency declaration, 12 Republicans voted with all Senate Democrats to pass the resolution. The Democratic-controlled House approved it last month, 245-182, with just 13 House Republicans breaking with the White House.\nNorth Carolina GOP Sen. Thom Tillis penned an opinion piece in the Washington Post on Feb. 25 saying he would vote for the resolution blocking the president's actions to go around Congress to build a border wall, but reversed himself and opposed it on Thursday.\nAt stake is nearly $6 billion in federal funds that President Trump redirected in a Feb. 15 emergency declaration. The White House is seeking to take that money from accounts at the Treasury and Defense departments to build physical barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border. The president made the order after Congress agreed on a bipartisan basis to provide $1.375 billion in wall funds for this fiscal year, but Trump said it wasn't enough.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., initially counseled the president against invoking the national emergency out of concerns it would divide Senate Republicans and test the separation of powers, but he voted with the president on Thursday and defended his actions as lawful.\n\"He has simply operated within existing law, the National Emergencies Act of 1976, to invoke a narrow set of authorities to reprogram a narrow set of funds,\" McConnell said. \"If Congress has grown uneasy with this new law, as many have, then we should amend it.\"\nA vote for today\u2019s resolution by Republican Senators is a vote for Nancy Pelosi, Crime, and the Open Border Democrats!\nDemocrats broadly oppose the wall, but have argued the resolution bends the intent of the law and the constitutional authority of Congress. \"We've never had a president like this. We've had lots of presidents with lots of foibles but none of them seem to equate their own ego with the entire functioning of the government of the United States except this one. We can't succumb to that,\" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.\nTrump said Thursday his declaration would withstand expected court challenges. \"The legal scholars all say it's totally constitutional. It's very important. It's really a border security vote,\" he said.\nMany Senate Republicans aren't as sure. \"Never before has a president asked for funding, Congress has not provided it, and the president then has used the National Emergencies Act of 1976 to spend the money anyway,\" said Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., who said congressional authority to appropriate federal tax dollars is a \"crucial source of our freedom.\"\n\"This declaration is a dangerous precedent,\" he added.\nOther Republicans tried and failed to cut a deal with the White House to help defeat the resolution. There was a last-ditch effort to get Trump to agree to back legislation by Sen.

In the past three years, a pandemic threatened our health, extreme weather threatened our communities, and Russian aggression threatened the world order. Perhaps the greatest crisis this nation faced during this period, though, was a President who sought to overturn the results of an election\u2014and who toyed with using emergency powers for that purpose. The question, then, becomes: How do we give presidents the tools they need to address emergencies, without giving them the tools to dismantle democracy? The answer lies in the Constitution\u2019s balance of powers\u2014a balance that has become dangerously skewed. In a functional system of emergency powers, Congress delegates extraordinary authority to the President, but retains the ability to curtail that authority if the President abuses it. In our current system, though, Congress plays far too weak a role. Presidents of both parties have taken advantage of this state of affairs, exploiting emergency powers to circumvent Congress on questions of policy. Without reforms to strengthen Congress\u2019s hand, a future President could leverage these powers to undermine not just the policymaking process, but democracy itself.\nEmergency Powers in Our Constitutional System\nEmergencies are, by definition, unforeseen and unforeseeable. For that reason, the powers conferred on the government by existing, non-emergency laws might be insufficient to address them. Amending the law to provide greater powers could take too long\u2014or do damage to principles held sacrosanct in ordinary times. Countries around the world have thus adopted emergency powers to give their heads of state a temporary boost in authority until the emergency passes or there is time to adapt the law to new realities.\nMost countries today have constitutions that include special ground rules for emergencies. In many cases, they allow the head of state to override rights that the constitution gives to the people; a small few even allow the head of state to suspend the legislature. Under this model, the normal constitutional order itself may be set aside.\nThe United States has taken a different approach. As Justice Robert Jackson put it in 1952, the Framers \u201cknew what emergencies were, knew the pressures they engender for authoritative action, knew, too, how they afford a ready pretext for usurpation. We may also suspect that they suspected that emergency powers would tend to kindle emergencies.\u201d The Constitution thus includes no separate regime for emergencies, and it grants the President no express emergency powers.\nTo be sure, presidents have claimed inherent constitutional powers to take extraordinary action during emergencies. Such claims have underpinned some of the worst abuses of executive power in this country\u2019s history, including the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II and the CIA\u2019s torture of detainees at black sites after 9/11. Whether the President has any such powers, and how far they might reach, are questions the Supreme Court has never definitively resolved. But the Court has squarely rejected the notion that emergencies give the President license to defy an otherwise legitimate act of Congress.\nAccordingly, presidents generally rely on Congress to provide them with the authorities they need to address emergencies. And Congress has been generous in doing so: Since the founding of the nation, Congress has passed hundreds of laws giving presidents special powers to address military, economic, and labor crises.\nThe National Emergencies Act\u2014Strong Powers, Weak Safeguards\nSince 1976, the most potent statutory framework for the exercise of emergency powers has been the National Emergencies Act (NEA). The law gives the President near-total discretion to declare a national emergency; there are no substantive criteria that must be met. The declaration then unlocks enhanced powers contained in more than 130 statutory provisions scattered across the U.S. Code.\nMany of these powers appear reasonable and measured\u2014for instance, the authority to waive weight limits on highways to facilitate the transport of jet fuel in a national emergency. Other provisions, however, are breathtaking in their potential for abuse. There are laws that allow the President to take over or shut down communications facilities, seize Americans\u2019 assets without judicial process, and exert seemingly unlimited control over domestic transportation. Astonishingly, there is even a law that allows the President to suspend the prohibition on government testing of chemical and biological agents on unwitting human subjects.\nRecognizing the risks inherent in these and other authorities, Congress included three provisions in the NEA intended to serve as safeguards against abuse. First, emergency declarations would automatically expire after a year unless the President renewed them. Second, Congress could terminate emergency declarations at any time through a so-called \u201clegislative veto\u201d\u2014a law that takes effect without the President\u2019s signature. Third, Congress would meet every six months while an emergency declaration was in effect to consider a vote on termination.\nAll three safeguards have proven impotent. Renewing emergency declarations requires nothing more than the President\u2019s signature on an executive order; presidents routinely renew declarations for years or even decades on end. In 1983, the Supreme Court held that legislative vetoes are unconstitutional, leaving Congress powerless to terminate an emergency declaration unless it can muster a veto-proof supermajority\u2014a near impossibility in today\u2019s hyperpartisan political environment. And for more than 40 years, Congress entirely ignored the requirement to take periodic votes on existing emergency declarations. The vast powers available to the Pres\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",
