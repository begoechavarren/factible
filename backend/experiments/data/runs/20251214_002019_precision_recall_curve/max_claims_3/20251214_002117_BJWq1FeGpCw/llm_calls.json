    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nWhat if I told you that someone had developed an energy source that could help us solve our biggest environmental challenges, purify our water and air, make our cities and homes more sanitary, and keep us safe from potential catastrophic climate change? What if I also told you that this energy source was cheap, plentiful, and reliable? Well, there is such a source. You probably know it as fossil fuel. Oil. Natural gas. Coal. But wait? Don\u2019t fossil fuels pollute our environment and make our climate unlivable? That, of course, is what we\u2019re told\u2026and what our children are taught. But let\u2019s look at the data. Here\u2019s a graph you\u2019ve probably never seen: the correlation between use of fossil fuels and access to clean water. More fossil fuel. More clean water. Am I saying the more we that we have used fossil fuel, the cleaner our water has become? Yes, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying. In the developed world, we take clean water for granted. We turn on a tap and it\u2019s there. But getting it there takes a massive amount of energy. Think of the man-made reservoirs, the purification plants, the network of pipes. In the undeveloped world, it\u2019s a much different story. They lack the energy, so they lack clean water. More fossil fuel. More clean water. The same is true of sanitation. By the use of cheap, plentiful, and reliable energy from fossil fuels, we have made our environment cleaner. Take a look at this graph. More fossil fuel. Better sanitation. Okay, what about air quality? Here\u2019s a graph of the air pollution trends in the United States over the last half century based on data from the Environmental Protection Agency. Note the dramatic downward trend in emissions, even though we use more fossil fuel than ever. How was this achieved? Above all, by using anti-pollution technology powered by\u2026 fossil fuel: oil, natural gas and coal. But even without modern pollution control technology, fossil fuel makes our air cleaner. Indoor pollution\u2014caused by burning a fire inside your house, cabin, hut or tent to cook and keep warm\u2014was a deadly global problem until the late 19th century when cheap kerosene, a fossil fuel byproduct, became available in America and Europe. Indoor pollution is still a major issue in the developing world today. The best solution? Fossil fuel. And now we come to the biggest fossil fuel concern of all\u2014global warming. On this very sensitive topic we need to get our terms straight: There is a big difference between mild global warming and catastrophic global warming. We can all agree on that, right? The issue isn\u2019t: does burning fossil fuel have some warming impact? It does. The issue is: is the climate warming dangerously fast? In 1986 NASA climate scientist James Hansen\u2014one of the world\u2019s most prominent critics of the use of fossil fuels\u2014predicted that \u201cif current trends are unchanged,\u201d temperatures would rise 2 to 4 degrees in the first decade of the 2000s. But as you can see from this graph, since 2000 the trend line is essentially flat\u2014little or no warming in the last 15 years. That\u2019s probably why we hear much less talk about \u201cglobal warming\u201d and much more talk about \u201cclimate change.\u201d Has this \u201cclimate change\u201d made our world more dangerous? The key statistic here, one that is, unfortunately, almost never mentioned, is \u201cclimate-related deaths,\u201d that is, how many people die each year from a climate-related cause, including droughts, floods, storms, and extreme temperatures. In the last eighty years, as CO2 emissions have rapidly escalated, the annual rate of climate-related deaths worldwide has rapidly declined -- by 98%. The reason is that the energy from fossil fuel has allowed the developed world to build a durable civilization, one highly resilient to extreme heat, extreme cold, floods, storms, and so on. The developing world\u2014where natural disasters can still wreak terrible havoc\u2014 would like the chance to do the same. But to do that they will need a lot more energy. The cheapest, fastest and easiest way to get that energy is from fossil fuels. In sum, fossil fuels don\u2019t take a naturally safe environment and make it dangerous; they empower us to take a naturally dangerous environment and make it cleaner and safer.

Meanwhile, maintaining global water supply is dependent on energy.\n\nFull Page Content:\nIs the ever-growing concern about dirty energy making you worried about the air you breathe and the water you drink? Fossil fuels are silently wreaking havoc on our environment, and the consequences are more severe than most people realize.\nFossil fuels are literally relics of the past. Think of them as nature\u2019s time capsules\u2014ancient plants and animals that got squished and cooked underground for millions of years. The result? Coal, oil, and natural gas. These energy-packed substances have been powering our world since the Industrial Revolution, and they\u2019re the main culprits behind our overheating planet.\nAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, fossil fuels make up about 79% of total U.S. primary energy production in 2022. They\u2019ve gotten us to where we are today, but it\u2019s time to upgrade to cleaner alternatives.\nNow, let\u2019s talk about the elephant in the room\u2014or, more accurately, the smog in the air. When we burn fossil fuels, we release a cocktail of pollutants into our atmosphere. The carbon dioxide produced is the primary culprit behind our overheating planet, acting as a blanket that lets in the light from the sun, but keeps the heat from getting out.\nOther byproducts like sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter also join the party, contributing to acid rain, smog, and respiratory issues. According to Bloomberg, as many as 1 in 10 American deaths today are caused by air pollution.\nBut the pollution doesn\u2019t stop at the air\u2014it is also causing quite a stir in our water. Harmful byproducts of fossil fuels make it into the water we drink. Fracking, a method used to extract natural gas, has been linked to groundwater pollution. A study found that in areas with shale gas development, there is 17 times more methane in the drinking water. And let\u2019s not forget about coal ash ponds and acid mine drainage, which sound like rejected supervillain lairs but are actually real threats to our rivers and streams, with the EPA identifying over 1,000 contaminated sites related to coal ash in the U.S. alone.\nThe environmental impacts of fossil fuels extend far beyond air and water pollution. Climate change due to carbon pollution causes the planet\u2019s rising temperatures, extreme weather events, wildfires, and rising sea levels.\nMining and drilling for fossil fuels destroys animal habitats, and the ocean becoming more acidic threatens marine life. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) states that the ocean absorbs about 30% of the CO2 released into the atmosphere, leading to a 30% increase in ocean acidity since the Industrial Revolution.\nThe use of dirty fossil fuel energy directly causes a lot of the environmental damage we see today. Thankfully, we can upgrade to clean energy, which has become much less expensive.\nThe cost of solar has fallen by 90% over the last decade, and the cost of wind by 70%. Many countries are also setting ambitious clean energy targets, with the United States promising to reduce emissions by 50% by 2030.\nWe\u2019re already upgrading to cleaner, safer, faster energy. But, in order to protect our planet for future generations, we need to do more.\n\u2705 Talk to your friends and family about climate change\n\u2705 Electrify your home with clean energy\n\u2705 Join us to advocate for policy solutions that will stop the pollution that\u2019s overheating the planet\nAre You Ready to Solve Climate Change?\nView Openings\n\u00a92025 Citizens' Climate Lobby.

At least 100 residents have ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nWatching the news, you get the sense that climate change is making the planet unlivable. We are bombarded with images of floods, droughts, storms and wildfires.\nWe see not only the deadly events nearby but far-flung disasters \u2014 as long as the pictures are scary enough.\nBut this impression is wildly misleading and makes it harder to get climate change policy right.\nData show climate-related events like floods, droughts, storms and wildfires aren\u2019t killing more people. Quite the contrary.\nOver the past decade, climate-related disasters have killed 98% fewer people than a century ago.\nThis should not be surprising, because the trend has been obvious for many decades, although it rarely gets reported.\nA century ago, in the 1920s, the average death toll from weather disasters was 485,000 per year.\nIn 1921, the New York Herald headlined its full-page coverage of droughts and famines across Europe with \u201cDeaths for Millions in 1921\u2019s Record Heat Wave.\u201c\nSince then, almost every decade has seen fewer deaths, with 168,000 average dead per year in the 1960s and less than 9,000 dead per year in the most recent decade, 2014-23.\nThe 98% drop in climate-related deaths is revealed by the most respected international disaster database, which is the gold standard in measuring these impacts.\nIt\u2019s reliable because very deadly catastrophes have been documented fairly consistently over the centuries.\nIt is true, of course, that smaller events \u2014 often with far fewer or no fatalities \u2014 are much more likely to have been overlooked in the past, because there were fewer people and less advanced technology.\nThat is why some media and climate campaigners increasingly point to a rise in reported events (rather than the declining death toll) as evidence that climate change is ravaging the planet.\nBut all of the increase has been in less-serious events, whereas more deadly events are few and declining.\nThe \u201crise\u201d is due to global interconnectedness that allows much better reporting of ever-small events, wherever they take place.\nThis is clear because the increase is seen in all categories of disasters measured \u2014 not only weather disasters, but also geophysical disasters like volcanoes and earthquakes, and technological disasters like train derailings.\nNot even radical climate activists claim that climate change is causing more trains to derail, or more volcanoes to explode.\nThat is why fatalities provide a much more robust measure.\nThese are falling dramatically because innovation has allowed humanity to better adapt to disasters.\nOne much-cited study shows that at the beginning of this century, an average of 3.4 million people experienced coastal flooding, with $11 billion in annual damages.\nAround $13 billion, or 0.05% of global GDP, was spent on coastal defenses.\nBy the end of this century, there will be more people in harm\u2019s way, and climate change will mean sea levels rise several feet.\nIf we do nothing and just keep coastal defenses as they are today, vast areas of the planet will be routinely inundated, flooding 187 million people and causing damage worth $55 trillion annually, costing more than 5% of global GDP.\nBut richer societies will adapt before things get that bad \u2014 especially because the cost of adaptation is very low in comparison to the potential damage, at just 0.005% of GDP.\nThis sensible adaptation means that despite higher sea levels, fewer people than ever will be flooded.\nBy 2100, there will be just 15,000 people flooded every year.\nEven the combined cost of adaptation and climate damages will decrease to just 0.008% of GDP.\nThese facts help show why seeing the bigger picture matters.\nLinking every disaster to climate change \u2014 and wrongly suggesting that things are getting much worse \u2014 makes us ignore practical, cost-effective solutions while the media focus our attention on costly climate policies that help little.\nEnormously ambitious climate policies costing hundreds of trillions of dollars would cut the number of flooded people by the end of the century from 15,000 to about 10,000 per year.\nWhile adaptation saves almost all of the 3.4 million people flooded today, climate policy can, at best, save just 0.005 million.\nThe calculation is even more stark for poor countries that have few resources and little disaster resilience. Bangladesh (then East Pakistan) suffered the largest recorded global death toll of 300,000 from a hurricane in 1970.\nSince then, it has developed and improved warning systems and shelters.\nOver the past decade, hurricane deaths have averaged just 160 a year, almost 2,000 times lower.\nTo help countries achieve fewer disaster deaths, we should promote prosperity, adaptation and resilience.\nOf course, weather disasters are just one aspect of climate change, which is a real global challenge that we should fix smartly.\nBut when we are inundated with \u201cweather porn,\u201d we end up focusing on the least effective policies first.\nBjorn Lomborg is president of the Copenhagen Consensus and Visiting Fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution.

Fossil fuels are silently wreaking havoc on our environment, and the consequences are more severe than most people realize.\nFossil fuels are literally relics of the past. Think of them as nature\u2019s time capsules\u2014ancient plants and animals that got squished and cooked underground for millions of years. The result? Coal, oil, and natural gas. These energy-packed substances have been powering our world since the Industrial Revolution, and they\u2019re the main culprits behind our overheating planet.\nAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, fossil fuels make up about 79% of total U.S. primary energy production in 2022. They\u2019ve gotten us to where we are today, but it\u2019s time to upgrade to cleaner alternatives.\nNow, let\u2019s talk about the elephant in the room\u2014or, more accurately, the smog in the air. When we burn fossil fuels, we release a cocktail of pollutants into our atmosphere. The carbon dioxide produced is the primary culprit behind our overheating planet, acting as a blanket that lets in the light from the sun, but keeps the heat from getting out.\nOther byproducts like sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter also join the party, contributing to acid rain, smog, and respiratory issues. According to Bloomberg, as many as 1 in 10 American deaths today are caused by air pollution.\nBut the pollution doesn\u2019t stop at the air\u2014it is also causing quite a stir in our water. Harmful byproducts of fossil fuels make it into the water we drink. Fracking, a method used to extract natural gas, has been linked to groundwater pollution. A study found that in areas with shale gas development, there is 17 times more methane in the drinking water. And let\u2019s not forget about coal ash ponds and acid mine drainage, which sound like rejected supervillain lairs but are actually real threats to our rivers and streams, with the EPA identifying over 1,000 contaminated sites related to coal ash in the U.S. alone.\nThe environmental impacts of fossil fuels extend far beyond air and water pollution. Climate change due to carbon pollution causes the planet\u2019s rising temperatures, extreme weather events, wildfires, and rising sea levels.\nMining and drilling for fossil fuels destroys animal habitats, and the ocean becoming more acidic threatens marine life. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) states that the ocean absorbs about 30% of the CO2 released into the atmosphere, leading to a 30% increase in ocean acidity since the Industrial Revolution.\nThe use of dirty fossil fuel energy directly causes a lot of the environmental damage we see today. Thankfully, we can upgrade to clean energy, which has become much less expensive.\nThe cost of solar has fallen by 90% over the last decade, and the cost of wind by 70%. Many countries are also setting ambitious clean energy targets, with the United States promising to reduce emissions by 50% by 2030.\nWe\u2019re already upgrading to cleaner, safer, faster energy. But, in order to protect our planet for future generations, we need to do more.\n\u2705 Talk to your friends and family about climate change\n\u2705 Electrify your home with clean energy\n\u2705 Join us to advocate for policy solutions that will stop the pollution that\u2019s overheating the planet\nAre You Ready to Solve Climate Change?\nView Openings\n\u00a92025 Citizens' Climate Lobby.

We are bombarded with images of floods, droughts, storms and wildfires.\nWe see not only the deadly events nearby but far-flung disasters \u2014 as long as the pictures are scary enough.\nBut this impression is wildly misleading and makes it harder to get climate change policy right.\nData show climate-related events like floods, droughts, storms and wildfires aren\u2019t killing more people. Quite the contrary.\nOver the past decade, climate-related disasters have killed 98% fewer people than a century ago.\nThis should not be surprising, because the trend has been obvious for many decades, although it rarely gets reported.\nA century ago, in the 1920s, the average death toll from weather disasters was 485,000 per year.\nIn 1921, the New York Herald headlined its full-page coverage of droughts and famines across Europe with \u201cDeaths for Millions in 1921\u2019s Record Heat Wave.\u201c\nSince then, almost every decade has seen fewer deaths, with 168,000 average dead per year in the 1960s and less than 9,000 dead per year in the most recent decade, 2014-23.\nThe 98% drop in climate-related deaths is revealed by the most respected international disaster database, which is the gold standard in measuring these impacts.\nIt\u2019s reliable because very deadly catastrophes have been documented fairly consistently over the centuries.\nIt is true, of course, that smaller events \u2014 often with far fewer or no fatalities \u2014 are much more likely to have been overlooked in the past, because there were fewer people and less advanced technology.\nThat is why some media and climate campaigners increasingly point to a rise in reported events (rather than the declining death toll) as evidence that climate change is ravaging the planet.\nBut all of the increase has been in less-serious events, whereas more deadly events are few and declining.\nThe \u201crise\u201d is due to global interconnectedness that allows much better reporting of ever-small events, wherever they take place.\nThis is clear because the increase is seen in all categories of disasters measured \u2014 not only weather disasters, but also geophysical disasters like volcanoes and earthquakes, and technological disasters like train derailings.\nNot even radical climate activists claim that climate change is causing more trains to derail, or more volcanoes to explode.\nThat is why fatalities provide a much more robust measure.\nThese are falling dramatically because innovation has allowed humanity to better adapt to disasters.\nOne much-cited study shows that at the beginning of this century, an average of 3.4 million people experienced coastal flooding, with $11 billion in annual damages.\nAround $13 billion, or 0.05% of global GDP, was spent on coastal defenses.\nBy the end of this century, there will be more people in harm\u2019s way, and climate change will mean sea levels rise several feet.\nIf we do nothing and just keep coastal defenses as they are today, vast areas of the planet will be routinely inundated, flooding 187 million people and causing damage worth $55 trillion annually, costing more than 5% of global GDP.\nBut richer societies will adapt before things get that bad \u2014 especially because the cost of adaptation is very low in comparison to the potential damage, at just 0.005% of GDP.\nThis sensible adaptation means that despite higher sea levels, fewer people than ever will be flooded.\nBy 2100, there will be just 15,000 people flooded every year.\nEven the combined cost of adaptation and climate damages will decrease to just 0.008% of GDP.\nThese facts help show why seeing the bigger picture matters.\nLinking every disaster to climate change \u2014 and wrongly suggesting that things are getting much worse \u2014 makes us ignore practical, cost-effective solutions while the media focus our attention on costly climate policies that help little.\nEnormously ambitious climate policies costing hundreds of trillions of dollars would cut the number of flooded people by the end of the century from 15,000 to about 10,000 per year.\nWhile adaptation saves almost all of the 3.4 million people flooded today, climate policy can, at best, save just 0.005 million.\nThe calculation is even more stark for poor countries that have few resources and little disaster resilience. Bangladesh (then East Pakistan) suffered the largest recorded global death toll of 300,000 from a hurricane in 1970.\nSince then, it has developed and improved warning systems and shelters.\nOver the past decade, hurricane deaths have averaged just 160 a year, almost 2,000 times lower.\nTo help countries achieve fewer disaster deaths, we should promote prosperity, adaptation and resilience.\nOf course, weather disasters are just one aspect of climate change, which is a real global challenge that we should fix smartly.\nBut when we are inundated with \u201cweather porn,\u201d we end up focusing on the least effective policies first.\nBjorn Lomborg is president of the Copenhagen Consensus and Visiting Fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution.

Only 3% of Earth\u2019s water is freshwater, and only 0.5% of all water is accessible and safe for human consumption. Freshwater is critical for survival. On average, a human being can live without water for only three days. Increasing drought and water shortages are reducing water availability. Meanwhile, data center developers are increasingly tapping into surface and underground aquifers to cool their facilities.\nData center water usage closely parallels energy usage and carbon emissions. As data centers use more energy for their typical data center operations and to meet AI requests, they consume larger amounts of water to cool their processor chips, so as to avoid overheating and potential damage. Similarly, as energy use increases in data centers, so do carbon emissions.\nA medium-sized data center can consume up to roughly 110 million gallons of water per year for cooling purposes, equivalent to the annual water usage of approximately 1,000 households. Larger data centers can each \u201cdrink\u201d up to 5 million gallons per day, or about 1.8 billion annually, usage equivalent to a town of 10,000 to 50,000 people. Together, the nation\u2019s 5,426 data centers consume billions of gallons of water annually. One report estimated that U.S. data centers consume 449 million gallons of water per day and 163.7 billion gallons annually (as of 2021). A 2016 report found that fewer than one-third of data center operators track water consumption. Water consumption is expected to continue increasing as data centers grow in number, size, and complexity.\nAccording to scientists at the University of California, Riverside, each 100-word AI prompt is estimated to use roughly one bottle of water (or 519 milliliters). This may not sound like much, but billions of AI users worldwide enter prompts into systems like ChatGPT every minute. Large language models require many energy-intensive calculations, necessitating liquid cooling systems.\nThe Water Cycle of Data Centers\nA data center\u2019s water footprint is calculated as the sum of three categories: on-site water usage, water use by power plant facilities that supply power to data centers, and water consumption during the manufacturing process of processor chips. Water can come from various sources, including blue sources (e.g., surface water and groundwater), piped sources such as municipal water, and gray sources (e.g., purified reclaimed water). Using recycled or non-potable water to meet a data center\u2019s cooling needs is a well-established practice to conserve limited potable water resources, particularly in dry or drought-prone areas.\nIn the context of data centers, \u201cwater consumption\u201d refers to the amount of water withdrawn from blue or gray sources minus the water discharged by the centers (primarily warm water left over from cooling the IT racks). The consumed water is generally the water that evaporates or is otherwise taken out of immediate human usage. Withdrawal of fresh water from local streams or underground aquifers may lead to aquifer exhaustion, particularly in water-stressed areas.\nResearchers at The Green Grid, a nonprofit industry consortium, developed a metric called Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE) to measure water usage by data centers. Similar to the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) metric, which measures the energy efficiency of a data center, the WUE metric assesses the efficiency of a data center\u2019s water use. WUE is reported in liters per kilowatt-hour (kWh): a data center\u2019s total water consumption, measured in liters, is divided by the total energy consumed by that data center in kilowatt-hours in the same time period. While \u201c0\u201d is the ideal WUE score, this can only be achieved in air-cooled data centers, and most data centers cannot meet this target due to their location\u2019s climate conditions. The average WUE across data centers is 1.9 liters per kWh, which is a great goal to beat.\nData centers' water usage depends on various factors, including location, climate, water availability, size, and IT rack chip densities. In hotter climates, like in the southwest United States, data centers need to use more water to cool the building and equipment. With the increasing number of centers supporting AI requests, chip density is also growing, which leads to higher room temperatures, necessitating the use of more water chillers at the server level to maintain cool temperatures. Most data centers use a combination of chillers and on-site cooling towers to avoid chip overheating.\nCooling data centers is a complex operation. At the server level, water chillers cool IT rooms to maintain optimal temperatures and prevent damage to chips. This can be achieved through air cooling using water evaporation, which is an open-loop and more water-intensive method, or through server liquid cooling. Server cooling is a more expensive approach that delivers the liquid coolant directly to the graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs). Direct-to-chip liquid cooling and immersive liquid cooling are two standard server liquid cooling technologies that dissipate heat while significantly reducing water consumption. During immersive cooling, water or specialized synthetic liquids flood the chips, absorbing the heat. The difference between direct server liquid cooling and air cooling through evaporation can be compared to the difference between drip irrigation and flooding in agriculture.\nIn areas with limited water availability, server liquid cooling is the best choice, as it requires minimal water consumption. Conversely, in areas with a strained power grid, an evaporative air cooling tower is a suitable building design, as it requires minimal power usage.\nRegardless of the approach chosen, a heat exchanger is necessary to capture the hot air or hot water produced as a byproduct of the cooling process.

Only 3% of Earth\u2019s water is freshwater, and only 0.5% of all water is accessible and safe for human consumption. Freshwater is critical for survival. On average, a human being can live without water for only three days. Increasing drought and water shortages are reducing water availability. Meanwhile, data center developers are increasingly tapping into surface and underground aquifers to cool their facilities.\nData center water usage closely parallels energy usage and carbon emissions. As data centers use more energy for their typical data center operations and to meet AI requests, they consume larger amounts of water to cool their processor chips, so as to avoid overheating and potential damage. Similarly, as energy use increases in data centers, so do carbon emissions.\nA medium-sized data center can consume up to roughly 110 million gallons of water per year for cooling purposes, equivalent to the annual water usage of approximately 1,000 households. Larger data centers can each \u201cdrink\u201d up to 5 million gallons per day, or about 1.8 billion annually, usage equivalent to a town of 10,000 to 50,000 people. Together, the nation\u2019s 5,426 data centers consume billions of gallons of water annually. One report estimated that U.S. data centers consume 449 million gallons of water per day and 163.7 billion gallons annually (as of 2021). A 2016 report found that fewer than one-third of data center operators track water consumption. Water consumption is expected to continue increasing as data centers grow in number, size, and complexity.\nAccording to scientists at the University of California, Riverside, each 100-word AI prompt is estimated to use roughly one bottle of water (or 519 milliliters). This may not sound like much, but billions of AI users worldwide enter prompts into systems like ChatGPT every minute. Large language models require many energy-intensive calculations, necessitating liquid cooling systems.\nThe Water Cycle of Data Centers\nA data center\u2019s water footprint is calculated as the sum of three categories: on-site water usage, water use by power plant facilities that supply power to data centers, and water consumption during the manufacturing process of processor chips. Water can come from various sources, including blue sources (e.g., surface water and groundwater), piped sources such as municipal water, and gray sources (e.g., purified reclaimed water). Using recycled or non-potable water to meet a data center\u2019s cooling needs is a well-established practice to conserve limited potable water resources, particularly in dry or drought-prone areas.\nIn the context of data centers, \u201cwater consumption\u201d refers to the amount of water withdrawn from blue or gray sources minus the water discharged by the centers (primarily warm water left over from cooling the IT racks). The consumed water is generally the water that evaporates or is otherwise taken out of immediate human usage. Withdrawal of fresh water from local streams or underground aquifers may lead to aquifer exhaustion, particularly in water-stressed areas.\nResearchers at The Green Grid, a nonprofit industry consortium, developed a metric called Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE) to measure water usage by data centers. Similar to the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) metric, which measures the energy efficiency of a data center, the WUE metric assesses the efficiency of a data center\u2019s water use. WUE is reported in liters per kilowatt-hour (kWh): a data center\u2019s total water consumption, measured in liters, is divided by the total energy consumed by that data center in kilowatt-hours in the same time period. While \u201c0\u201d is the ideal WUE score, this can only be achieved in air-cooled data centers, and most data centers cannot meet this target due to their location\u2019s climate conditions. The average WUE across data centers is 1.9 liters per kWh, which is a great goal to beat.\nData centers' water usage depends on various factors, including location, climate, water availability, size, and IT rack chip densities. In hotter climates, like in the southwest United States, data centers need to use more water to cool the building and equipment. With the increasing number of centers supporting AI requests, chip density is also growing, which leads to higher room temperatures, necessitating the use of more water chillers at the server level to maintain cool temperatures. Most data centers use a combination of chillers and on-site cooling towers to avoid chip overheating.\nCooling data centers is a complex operation. At the server level, water chillers cool IT rooms to maintain optimal temperatures and prevent damage to chips. This can be achieved through air cooling using water evaporation, which is an open-loop and more water-intensive method, or through server liquid cooling.

Access to improved water exhibits a causal relationship with inclusive economic ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nJune 25, 2025\nHighlights:\nAI/Data Center Resources\nData centers have a thirst for water, and their rapid expansion threatens freshwater supplies. Only 3% of Earth\u2019s water is freshwater, and only 0.5% of all water is accessible and safe for human consumption. Freshwater is critical for survival. On average, a human being can live without water for only three days. Increasing drought and water shortages are reducing water availability. Meanwhile, data center developers are increasingly tapping into surface and underground aquifers to cool their facilities.\nData center water usage closely parallels energy usage and carbon emissions. As data centers use more energy for their typical data center operations and to meet AI requests, they consume larger amounts of water to cool their processor chips, so as to avoid overheating and potential damage. Similarly, as energy use increases in data centers, so do carbon emissions.\nA medium-sized data center can consume up to roughly 110 million gallons of water per year for cooling purposes, equivalent to the annual water usage of approximately 1,000 households. Larger data centers can each \u201cdrink\u201d up to 5 million gallons per day, or about 1.8 billion annually, usage equivalent to a town of 10,000 to 50,000 people. Together, the nation\u2019s 5,426 data centers consume billions of gallons of water annually. One report estimated that U.S. data centers consume 449 million gallons of water per day and 163.7 billion gallons annually (as of 2021). A 2016 report found that fewer than one-third of data center operators track water consumption. Water consumption is expected to continue increasing as data centers grow in number, size, and complexity.\nAccording to scientists at the University of California, Riverside, each 100-word AI prompt is estimated to use roughly one bottle of water (or 519 milliliters). This may not sound like much, but billions of AI users worldwide enter prompts into systems like ChatGPT every minute. Large language models require many energy-intensive calculations, necessitating liquid cooling systems.\nThe Water Cycle of Data Centers\nA data center\u2019s water footprint is calculated as the sum of three categories: on-site water usage, water use by power plant facilities that supply power to data centers, and water consumption during the manufacturing process of processor chips. Water can come from various sources, including blue sources (e.g., surface water and groundwater), piped sources such as municipal water, and gray sources (e.g., purified reclaimed water). Using recycled or non-potable water to meet a data center\u2019s cooling needs is a well-established practice to conserve limited potable water resources, particularly in dry or drought-prone areas.\nIn the context of data centers, \u201cwater consumption\u201d refers to the amount of water withdrawn from blue or gray sources minus the water discharged by the centers (primarily warm water left over from cooling the IT racks). The consumed water is generally the water that evaporates or is otherwise taken out of immediate human usage. Withdrawal of fresh water from local streams or underground aquifers may lead to aquifer exhaustion, particularly in water-stressed areas.\nResearchers at The Green Grid, a nonprofit industry consortium, developed a metric called Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE) to measure water usage by data centers. Similar to the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) metric, which measures the energy efficiency of a data center, the WUE metric assesses the efficiency of a data center\u2019s water use. WUE is reported in liters per kilowatt-hour (kWh): a data center\u2019s total water consumption, measured in liters, is divided by the total energy consumed by that data center in kilowatt-hours in the same time period. While \u201c0\u201d is the ideal WUE score, this can only be achieved in air-cooled data centers, and most data centers cannot meet this target due to their location\u2019s climate conditions. The average WUE across data centers is 1.9 liters per kWh, which is a great goal to beat.\nData centers' water usage depends on various factors, including location, climate, water availability, size, and IT rack chip densities. In hotter climates, like in the southwest United States, data centers need to use more water to cool the building and equipment. With the increasing number of centers supporting AI requests, chip density is also growing, which leads to higher room temperatures, necessitating the use of more water chillers at the server level to maintain cool temperatures. Most data centers use a combination of chillers and on-site cooling towers to avoid chip overheating.\nCooling data centers is a complex operation. At the server level, water chillers cool IT rooms to maintain optimal temperatures and prevent damage to chips. This can be achieved through air cooling using water evaporation, which is an open-loop and more water-intensive method, or through server liquid cooling. Server cooling is a more expensive approach that delivers the liquid coolant directly to the graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs). Direct-to-chip liquid cooling and immersive liquid cooling are two standard server liquid cooling technologies that dissipate heat while significantly reducing water consumption. During immersive cooling, water or specialized synthetic liquids flood the chips, absorbing the heat. The difference between direct server liquid cooling and air cooling through evaporation can be compared to the difference between drip irrigation and flooding in agriculture.\nIn areas with limited water availability, server liquid cooling is the best choice, as it requires minimal water consumption. Conversely, in areas with a strained power grid, an evaporative air cooling tower is a suitable building design, as it requires minimal power usage.\nRegardless of the approach chosen, a heat exchanger is necessary to capture the hot air or hot water produced as a byproduct of the cooling process.

Only 3% of Earth\u2019s water is freshwater, and only 0.5% of all water is accessible and safe for human consumption. Freshwater is critical for survival. On average, a human being can live without water for only three days. Increasing drought and water shortages are reducing water availability. Meanwhile, data center developers are increasingly tapping into surface and underground aquifers to cool their facilities.\nData center water usage closely parallels energy usage and carbon emissions. As data centers use more energy for their typical data center operations and to meet AI requests, they consume larger amounts of water to cool their processor chips, so as to avoid overheating and potential damage. Similarly, as energy use increases in data centers, so do carbon emissions.\nA medium-sized data center can consume up to roughly 110 million gallons of water per year for cooling purposes, equivalent to the annual water usage of approximately 1,000 households. Larger data centers can each \u201cdrink\u201d up to 5 million gallons per day, or about 1.8 billion annually, usage equivalent to a town of 10,000 to 50,000 people. Together, the nation\u2019s 5,426 data centers consume billions of gallons of water annually. One report estimated that U.S. data centers consume 449 million gallons of water per day and 163.7 billion gallons annually (as of 2021). A 2016 report found that fewer than one-third of data center operators track water consumption. Water consumption is expected to continue increasing as data centers grow in number, size, and complexity.\nAccording to scientists at the University of California, Riverside, each 100-word AI prompt is estimated to use roughly one bottle of water (or 519 milliliters). This may not sound like much, but billions of AI users worldwide enter prompts into systems like ChatGPT every minute. Large language models require many energy-intensive calculations, necessitating liquid cooling systems.\nThe Water Cycle of Data Centers\nA data center\u2019s water footprint is calculated as the sum of three categories: on-site water usage, water use by power plant facilities that supply power to data centers, and water consumption during the manufacturing process of processor chips. Water can come from various sources, including blue sources (e.g., surface water and groundwater), piped sources such as municipal water, and gray sources (e.g., purified reclaimed water). Using recycled or non-potable water to meet a data center\u2019s cooling needs is a well-established practice to conserve limited potable water resources, particularly in dry or drought-prone areas.\nIn the context of data centers, \u201cwater consumption\u201d refers to the amount of water withdrawn from blue or gray sources minus the water discharged by the centers (primarily warm water left over from cooling the IT racks). The consumed water is generally the water that evaporates or is otherwise taken out of immediate human usage. Withdrawal of fresh water from local streams or underground aquifers may lead to aquifer exhaustion, particularly in water-stressed areas.\nResearchers at The Green Grid, a nonprofit industry consortium, developed a metric called Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE) to measure water usage by data centers. Similar to the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) metric, which measures the energy efficiency of a data center, the WUE metric assesses the efficiency of a data center\u2019s water use. WUE is reported in liters per kilowatt-hour (kWh): a data center\u2019s total water consumption, measured in liters, is divided by the total energy consumed by that data center in kilowatt-hours in the same time period. While \u201c0\u201d is the ideal WUE score, this can only be achieved in air-cooled data centers, and most data centers cannot meet this target due to their location\u2019s climate conditions. The average WUE across data centers is 1.9 liters per kWh, which is a great goal to beat.\nData centers' water usage depends on various factors, including location, climate, water availability, size, and IT rack chip densities. In hotter climates, like in the southwest United States, data centers need to use more water to cool the building and equipment. With the increasing number of centers supporting AI requests, chip density is also growing, which leads to higher room temperatures, necessitating the use of more water chillers at the server level to maintain cool temperatures. Most data centers use a combination of chillers and on-site cooling towers to avoid chip overheating.\nCooling data centers is a complex operation. At the server level, water chillers cool IT rooms to maintain optimal temperatures and prevent damage to chips. This can be achieved through air cooling using water evaporation, which is an open-loop and more water-intensive method, or through server liquid cooling. Server cooling is a more expensive approach that delivers the liquid coolant directly to the graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs). Direct-to-chip liquid cooling and immersive liquid cooling are two standard server liquid cooling technologies that dissipate heat while significantly reducing water consumption. During immersive cooling, water or specialized synthetic liquids flood the chips, absorbing the heat. The difference between direct server liquid cooling and air cooling through evaporation can be compared to the difference between drip irrigation and flooding in agriculture.\nIn areas with limited water availability, server liquid cooling is the best choice, as it requires minimal water consumption. Conversely, in areas with a strained power grid, an evaporative air cooling tower is a suitable building design, as it requires minimal power usage.\nRegardless of the approach chosen, a heat exchanger is necessary to capture the hot air or hot water produced as a byproduct of the cooling process.

The negative impacts that non-renewable energy sources like fossil fuels have on air quality, climate change, and environmental health have become increasingly clear. By increasingly relying on renewable energy sources like wind and solar power, we can reap a wide variety of benefits including reduced air pollution, lower greenhouse gas emission levels, decreased healthcare costs, a more resilient electrical grid, and job generation.\nThe UN says that with technology available today, cheap electricity from renewable sources could provide 65 percent of the world\u2019s total electricity supply by 2030 and decarbonize 90 percent of the power sector by 2050, massively cutting carbon emissions and improving air quality. But what exactly is the relationship between energy production and air pollution? We\u2019ll take a deep dive into this topic and see that the benefits of investing in clean energy sources become even more compelling when both air quality and climate benefits are considered.\nNon-renewable energy comes from sources that cannot be replenished in our lifetime. The most common sources of non-renewable energy are carbon-containing fossil fuels, including coal, petroleum, and natural gas. According to data from the Central Intelligence Agency, more than 66% of world electric generation comes from fossil fuels today.\nIn contrast, renewable energy comes from sources that can be replenished faster than they are consumed.\nRenewable energy sources produce little to no greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change, even when considering their life cycle emissions that occur through each stage of the technology\u2019s use.\nAside from relying on dwindling and expensive resources, non-renewable energy sources \u2014 specifically, fossil fuel combustion \u2014 create vast harm by releasing toxic air pollution and greenhouse gases that threaten air quality and climate health.\nEstimates from Harvard calculate that air pollution from fossil fuels may be responsible for as many as one in five deaths worldwide. Air pollution from coal-fired power plants impacts not only people in the immediate vicinity but can travel long distances depending on the prevailing wind speed and direction and put large portions of the population at risk.\nThe most common renewable energy sources include wind, solar, and geothermal with two of the safest and most common being wind and solar.\nWind energy is created using wind turbines which can be placed anywhere with high-speed winds, including hilltops to open water. Wind energy is one of the cleanest sources of energy because wind turbines do not affect air pollution emissions in any direct way and do not need water for cooling.\nSolar energy, which uses solar or photovoltaic cells to convert sunlight into electricity, is also very clean in that it doesn\u2019t produce air pollutants or contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. However, the process of manufacturing solar panels may produce some emissions.\nGeothermal energy relies on the heat produced within the Earth. Water is injected deep underground and is heated by the Earth\u2019s molten interior and returns as hot water or steam; this steam is used to power a turbine to generate electricity. Geothermal energy produces only one-sixth of the carbon dioxide of a natural gas powerplant and little to no NO2 or SO2 pollution.\nWhile biomass is sometimes listed as a source of renewable energy, the American Lung Association opposes biomass combustion as a form of energy generation because this process creates particle pollution and releases other carcinogens. However, pyrolysis \u2014 where biomass is heated in an anaerobic environment without oxygen, breaking down into oils and gases \u2014 is a potential alternative to incineration that is known to produce fewer air pollutants than burning.\nAn exciting future may exist when it comes to nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion, a process where light elements are combined to form heavier elements and release energy in the process, made recent headlines due to a scientific breakthrough where scientists demonstrated a positive energy gain in the reaction for the first time.\nHowever, we\u2019re still far from being able to use nuclear fusion as a viable energy source. Though this process can not yet be practically applied commercially, it holds the potential for a clean, safe, carbon-free, and near-limitless source of energy in the future.\nRenewable energy use is growing across the globe but unfortunately still accounts for just a portion of overall energy generation.\nGlobally, even though fossil fuels still account for the majority of energy production, renewable energy sources now make up 29% of current electricity production.\nIn the United States, 29% of greenhouse gas emissions come from electricity production, particularly from fossil fuel combustion. However, the U.S. is increasing its use of nonfossil fuel sources of energy, with 21% of the country\u2019s energy consumption coming from renewable sources in 2020 \u2014 the highest share since the early 1900s.\nBy increasing the supply and use of renewable energy like wind and solar, we can replace carbon-intensive sources like fossil fuels and lower the amount of greenhouse gas emissions released.\nAir pollution is a severe global crisis, with the World Health Organi\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The second and third scenarios assume that 25% (quarter way) and 50% (half way) of exposure reduction towards the fossil phase-out are realised. The fourth scenario removes all human-induced (anthropogenic) sources of air pollution, leaving only natural sources such as desert dust and natural wildfires.\nThe results show that in 2019, 8.3 million deaths worldwide were attributable to fine particles (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) in ambient air, of which 61% (5.1 million) were linked to fossil fuels. This corresponds to 82% of the maximum number of air pollution deaths that could be averted by controlling all anthropogenic emissions.\nAttributable deaths to all sources of ambient air pollution were highest across South and East Asia, particularly in China with 2.44 million per year, followed by India with 2.18 million per year.\nMost (52%) of deaths were related to common conditions such as ischaemic heart disease (30%), stroke (16%), chronic obstructive lung disease (16%) and diabetes (6%). About 20% were undefined but are likely to be partly linked to high blood pressure and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.\nPhasing out fossil fuels would result in the largest absolute reductions in attributable deaths in South, South East and East Asia, amounting to about 3.85 million annually, equivalent to 80-85% of potentially preventable deaths from all anthropogenic sources of ambient air pollution in these regions.\nIn high income countries (that are largely dependent on fossil energy) about 460,000 deaths annually could potentially be prevented by a fossil fuel phase out, representing about 90% of the potentially preventable deaths from all anthropogenic sources of ambient air pollution.\nThe researchers acknowledge that their new model has led to larger estimates than most previous studies. Reasons for this include taking account of all cause in addition to disease specific deaths and basing their model solely on studies of ambient air pollution.\nAs such, they say uncertainty remains, but given the Paris Climate Agreement's goal of climate neutrality by 2050, \u201cthe replacement of fossil fuels by clean, renewable energy sources would have tremendous public health and climate co-benefits.\u201d\nThe forthcoming COP28 climate change negotiations in the United Arab Emirates \u201coffer an opportunity to make substantial progress towards phasing out fossil fuels.

The second and third scenarios assume that 25% (quarter way) and 50% (half way) of exposure reduction towards the fossil phase-out are realised. The fourth scenario removes all human-induced (anthropogenic) sources of air pollution, leaving only natural sources such as desert dust and natural wildfires.\nThe results show that in 2019, 8.3 million deaths worldwide were attributable to fine particles (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) in ambient air, of which 61% (5.1 million) were linked to fossil fuels. This corresponds to 82% of the maximum number of air pollution deaths that could be averted by controlling all anthropogenic emissions.\nAttributable deaths to all sources of ambient air pollution were highest across South and East Asia, particularly in China with 2.44 million per year, followed by India with 2.18 million per year.\nMost (52%) of deaths were related to common conditions such as ischaemic heart disease (30%), stroke (16%), chronic obstructive lung disease (16%) and diabetes (6%). About 20% were undefined but are likely to be partly linked to high blood pressure and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.\nPhasing out fossil fuels would result in the largest absolute reductions in attributable deaths in South, South East and East Asia, amounting to about 3.85 million annually, equivalent to 80-85% of potentially preventable deaths from all anthropogenic sources of ambient air pollution in these regions.\nIn high income countries (that are largely dependent on fossil energy) about 460,000 deaths annually could potentially be prevented by a fossil fuel phase out, representing about 90% of the potentially preventable deaths from all anthropogenic sources of ambient air pollution.\nThe researchers acknowledge that their new model has led to larger estimates than most previous studies. Reasons for this include taking account of all cause in addition to disease specific deaths and basing their model solely on studies of ambient air pollution.\nAs such, they say uncertainty remains, but given the Paris Climate Agreement's goal of climate neutrality by 2050, \u201cthe replacement of fossil fuels by clean, renewable energy sources would have tremendous public health and climate co-benefits.\u201d\nThe forthcoming COP28 climate change negotiations in the United Arab Emirates \u201coffer an opportunity to make substantial progress towards phasing out fossil fuels.
