Reverse transcription is an essential step in retroviral replication. This article presents an overview of reverse transcription, briefly describes the structure and function of RT, provides an introduction to some of the cellular and viral factors that can affect reverse transcription, and discusses fidelity and recombination, two processes in which reverse transcription plays an important role. In keeping with the theme of the collection, the emphasis is on HIV-1 and HIV-1 RT.\nMore than half of the drugs currently approved to treat HIV-1 infections are reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Therefore, the continued characterization of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and the process of reverse transcription is vital.\nIt has been 40 years since the discovery of reverse transcriptase (RT) was announced by Howard Temin and David Baltimore, who independently showed that retroviral virions contain an enzymatic activity that can copy RNA into DNA (Baltimore 1970; Mizutani et al. 1970). These experiments provided the crucial proof of Temin\u2019s provirus hypothesis that retroviral infections persist because the RNA genome found in the virions is converted into DNA (Temin 1964). The sequences of the genomes of eukaryotes show how pervasive reverse transcription is in nature; not only do these genomes contain large numbers of endogenous retroviruses, but also a variety of retroposons and reverse-transcribed elements. The discovery in the early 1980s, that AIDS is caused by a human retrovirus, HIV-1, invigorated retroviral research and focused attention on the viral enzymes, which have become the primary target of anti-AIDS drugs. Not surprisingly, the focus of RT research shifted from the RTs of the murine leukemia viruses (MLV) and the avian myeloblastosis virus to HIV-1 RT. The first approved anti-HIV drug, AZT, targets RT, and of the 26 drugs currently approved to treat HIV-1 infections, 14 are RT inhibitors. In addition, RTs (primarily recombinant MLV RTs) have become extremely valuable tools that are widely used in research, in clinical/diagnostic tests, and in biotechnology. We provide here a relatively brief description of the process of reverse transcription, the structure and biochemical functions of RT, some information about how other viral and cellular factors influence reverse transcription, and briefly consider how the reverse transcription process affects both the mutations that arise during the retroviral life cycle and recombination. The focus will be HIV-1 and HIV-1 RT; however, in some cases, we will draw on insights and include information obtained with other retroviruses and other RTs. Although the issues of the inhibition of HIV-1 RT by anti-RT drugs and the mechanisms of drug resistance are of considerable importance, these issues will not be addressed in detail here; the reader is directed to Arts and Hazuda (2011). Given that the literature on RT and reverse transcription is both vast and complex, and the space allowed for this article is limited, we have had to make some difficult choices in what to present, and what to omit, both in terms of the material and the references. For the omissions, we apologize.\nWhen a mature HIV-1 virion infects a susceptible target cell, interactions of the envelope glycoprotein with the coreceptors on the surface of the cell brings about a fusion of the membranes of the host cell and the virion (Wilen et al. 2011). This fusion introduces the contents of the virion into the cytoplasm of the cell, setting the stage for reverse transcription. There are complexities to the early events that accompany reverse transcription in an infected cell, not all of which are well understood, which will be considered later in this article. We will begin by discussing the mechanics of the conversion of the single-stranded RNA genome found in the virion into the linear double-stranded DNA that is the substrate for the integration process. The synthesis of this linear DNA is a reasonably well-understood process; additional details and references can be found in the books Retroviruses (Telesnitsky and Goff 1997) and Reverse Transcriptase (Skalka and Goff 1993). In orthoretroviruses, including HIV-1, reverse transcription takes place in newly infected cells. There is some debate in the literature about whether reverse transcription is initiated in producer cells. Primer tagging experiments suggest that most HIV-1 virions initiate reverse transcription in newly infected cells (Whitcomb et al. 1990); however, there are claims that a small number of nucleotides may be incorporated before the virions initiate infection of target cells (Lori et al. 1992; Trono 1992; Zhu and Cunningham 1993; Huang et al. 1997). Either way, the vast majority of the viral DNA is synthesized in newly infected cells. This is a lifestyle choice; spumaretroviruses and the more distantly related hepadna viruses carry out extensive reverse transcription in producer cells (Summers and Mason 1982; Yu et al. 1996, 1999). Although there are viral and cellular factors that assist in the process of reverse transcription (these will be discussed later) the two enzymatic activities that are necessary and sufficient to carry out reverse transcription are present in RT. These are a DNA polymerase that can copy either a RNA or a DNA template, and an RNase H that degrades RNA if, and only if, it is part of an RNA\u2013DNA duplex.\nLike many other DNA polymerases, RT needs both a primer and a template. Genomic RNA is plus-stranded (the genome and the messages are copied from the same DNA strand), and the primer for the synthesis of the first DNA strand (the minus strand) is a host tRNA whose 3\u2032 end is base paired to a compl\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The discovery in the early 1980s, that AIDS is caused by a human retrovirus, HIV-1, invigorated retroviral research and focused attention on the viral enzymes, which have become the primary target of anti-AIDS drugs.

The first approved anti-HIV drug, AZT, targets RT, and of the 26 drugs currently approved to treat HIV-1 infections, 14 are RT inhibitors.

We provide here a relatively brief description of the process of reverse transcription, the structure and biochemical functions of RT, some information about how other viral and cellular factors influence reverse transcription, and briefly consider how the reverse transcription process affects both the mutations that arise during the retroviral life cycle and recombination. The focus will be HIV-1 and HIV-1 RT; however, in some cases, we will draw on insights and include information obtained with other retroviruses and other RTs. Although the issues of the inhibition of HIV-1 RT by anti-RT drugs and the mechanisms of drug resistance are of considerable importance, these issues will not be addressed in detail here; the reader is directed to Arts and Hazuda (2011).

For the omissions, we apologize.\nWhen a mature HIV-1 virion infects a susceptible target cell, interactions of the envelope glycoprotein with the coreceptors on the surface of the cell brings about a fusion of the membranes of the host cell and the virion (Wilen et al. 2011). This fusion introduces the contents of the virion into the cytoplasm of the cell, setting the stage for reverse transcription. There are complexities to the early events that accompany reverse transcription in an infected cell, not all of which are well understood, which will be considered later in this article. We will begin by discussing the mechanics of the conversion of the single-stranded RNA genome found in the virion into the linear double-stranded DNA that is the substrate for the integration process. The synthesis of this linear DNA is a reasonably well-understood process; additional details and references can be found in the books Retroviruses (Telesnitsky and Goff 1997) and Reverse Transcriptase (Skalka and Goff 1993). In orthoretroviruses, including HIV-1, reverse transcription takes place in newly infected cells. There is some debate in the literature about whether reverse transcription is initiated in producer cells. Primer tagging experiments suggest that most HIV-1 virions initiate reverse transcription in newly infected cells (Whitcomb et al. 1990); however, there are claims that a small number of nucleotides may be incorporated before the virions initiate infection of target cells (Lori et al. 1992; Trono 1992; Zhu and Cunningham 1993; Huang et al. 1997). Either way, the vast majority of the viral DNA is synthesized in newly infected cells. This is a lifestyle choice; spumaretroviruses and the more distantly related hepadna viruses carry out extensive reverse transcription in producer cells (Summers and Mason 1982; Yu et al. 1996, 1999). Although there are viral and cellular factors that assist in the process of reverse transcription (these will be discussed later) the two enzymatic activities that are necessary and sufficient to carry out reverse transcription are present in RT.

This results in destruction of CD4+ T-cells and leads ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nHIV is a disease in which the original clinical observations of severe opportunistic infections gave the first clues regarding the underlying pathology, namely that HIV is essentially an infection of the immune system. HIV infects and deletes CD4+ T cells that normally coordinate the adaptive T- and B-cell response to defend against intracellular pathogens. The immune defect is immediate and profound: At the time of acute infection with an AIDS virus, typically more than half of the gut-associated CD4+ T cells are depleted, leaving a damaged immune system to contend with a life-long infection.\nAt the time of acute HIV infection, more than half of the gut-associated CD4+ T cells are depleted, leaving a damaged immune system to contend with a life-long infection.\nThe earliest studies of T-cell function among infected persons revealed aspects of HIV immunopathogenesis that are still not fully understood. Despite initial and persistent damage to CD4+ T cells, and a lack of detectable HIV-specific CD4+ T helper cells (Murray et al. 1984; Lane et al. 1985), the magnitude and breadth of CD8+ T-cell responses to HIV in infected humans were found to be robust, with direct effector function of such a magnitude that it could be readily detected in freshly isolated lymphocytes from peripheral blood and brochoalveolar lavage in persons with AIDS (Plata et al. 1987; Walker et al. 1987; Nixon et al. 1988). HIV was already known to be an immunosuppressive disease, yet these cells were present in such robust quantity that they could be detected by assays measuring the ability of freshly isolated peripheral blood cells to lyse autologous B cells infected with recombinant vaccinia-HIV vectors or peptide pulsed targets (Walker et al. 1987; Nixon et al. 1988). Moreover, CD8+ T cells from infected persons were able to inhibit HIV replication (Walker et al. 1986), clearly showing that these cells were functional at least in vitro, but despite this, persons were progressing to AIDS.\nSubsequent studies using other approaches such as interferon \u03b3 Elispot (Dalod et al. 1999), intracellular cytokine (Maecker et al. 2001), and peptide MHC tetramer assays (Altman et al. 1996) confirmed and quantified these robust CD8+ T-cell responses. Most chronically infected persons target more than a dozen CD8+ epitopes simultaneously (Addo et al. 2003), and in some instances up to 19% of CD8+ T cells are specific for HIV (Richardson 2000; Betts et al. 2001; Papagno et al. 2002), yet control of viremia is not achieved. At the same time, HIV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses were found to be severely impaired, particularly as measured by the ability of these cells to proliferate to viral antigens (Wahren et al. 1987). Thus, from the early studies there was a clear disconnect between the lack of HIV-specific CD4+ T cells and the abundance of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells.\nDespite these conundrums, there were early signs that CD8+ T cells play a role in controlling HIV disease progression. Sequencing of autologous virus from infected persons revealed evidence of immune selection pressure mediated by these responses (Phillips et al. 1991) and an association with the initial decline in peak viremia after acute infection (Borrow et al. 1994; Koup et al. 1994). The development of HLA-class I-peptide tetramers confirmed the presence of robust induction of responses to multiple epitopes (Altman et al. 1996), and as larger numbers of patients were studied, it also became clear that among the strongest associations with disease outcome was the expression of certain HLA class I alleles (Kaslow et al. 1996; Migueles et al. 2000; Gao et al. 2001), implicating class I restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) as a major modulator of disease progression. The relationship between CD8+ T-cell immune function and viral control was shown by experimental depletion of CD8+ T cells in animal models of AIDS virus infection (Jin et al. 1999; Schmitz et al. 1999). As sensitive viral load assays became available, it also became clear that some infected persons were able to control viremia to levels below detection by the most sensitive RNA assays, and that these persons were characterized by robust HIV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses (Rosenberg et al. 1997). However, now a quarter century into the epidemic the precise role of T cells in HIV control, and the precise phenotype, specificity and function of T cells that should be induced with a vaccine, remain unclear. And from the standpoint of vaccine development, it remains controversial as to how much insight is to be gained from the study of persons who have become infected, because by definition these are not protective responses.\nAcute HIV infection is often associated with a transient febrile illness, much like infectious mononucleosis (Ho et al. 1985), which has facilitated the identification of persons in the earliest stages of infection, who are HIV RNA positive but not yet HIV antibody positive. Important justification for the intense study of acute infection is the demonstration that early events predict subsequent disease progression (Mellors et al. 1996; Lyles et al. 2000). Acute infection is associated with a decline in peak viremia from \u223c1\u20135 million viral copies/mL to a steady state of \u223c30,000 copies (Lyles et al. 2000), but peak levels of viremia may be much lower in asymptomatic persons (Fiebig et al. 2003). Very few studies have actually examined CD8+ T-cell responses in the earliest stages of infection (Fiebig stage I and II), but when those studies have been performed it is clear that initial immune responses are very narrowly directed (Goonetilleke et al. 2009) and remain narrowly directed as viral set point is achieved (Dalod et al. 1999; Altfeld et al. 2001). Even when responses to autologous virus are measured, the initial detectable response has usually been to only one to three epitopes (Goonetilleke et al. 2009), even though the autologou\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

These experiments provided the crucial proof of Temin\u2019s provirus hypothesis that retroviral infections persist because the RNA genome found in the virions is converted into DNA (Temin 1964). The sequences of the genomes of eukaryotes show how pervasive reverse transcription is in nature; not only do these genomes contain large numbers of endogenous retroviruses, but also a variety of retroposons and reverse-transcribed elements. The discovery in the early 1980s, that AIDS is caused by a human retrovirus, HIV-1, invigorated retroviral research and focused attention on the viral enzymes, which have become the primary target of anti-AIDS drugs. Not surprisingly, the focus of RT research shifted from the RTs of the murine leukemia viruses (MLV) and the avian myeloblastosis virus to HIV-1 RT. The first approved anti-HIV drug, AZT, targets RT, and of the 26 drugs currently approved to treat HIV-1 infections, 14 are RT inhibitors. In addition, RTs (primarily recombinant MLV RTs) have become extremely valuable tools that are widely used in research, in clinical/diagnostic tests, and in biotechnology. We provide here a relatively brief description of the process of reverse transcription, the structure and biochemical functions of RT, some information about how other viral and cellular factors influence reverse transcription, and briefly consider how the reverse transcription process affects both the mutations that arise during the retroviral life cycle and recombination. The focus will be HIV-1 and HIV-1 RT; however, in some cases, we will draw on insights and include information obtained with other retroviruses and other RTs. Although the issues of the inhibition of HIV-1 RT by anti-RT drugs and the mechanisms of drug resistance are of considerable importance, these issues will not be addressed in detail here; the reader is directed to Arts and Hazuda (2011). Given that the literature on RT and reverse transcription is both vast and complex, and the space allowed for this article is limited, we have had to make some difficult choices in what to present, and what to omit, both in terms of the material and the references. For the omissions, we apologize.\nWhen a mature HIV-1 virion infects a susceptible target cell, interactions of the envelope glycoprotein with the coreceptors on the surface of the cell brings about a fusion of the membranes of the host cell and the virion (Wilen et al. 2011). This fusion introduces the contents of the virion into the cytoplasm of the cell, setting the stage for reverse transcription. There are complexities to the early events that accompany reverse transcription in an infected cell, not all of which are well understood, which will be considered later in this article. We will begin by discussing the mechanics of the conversion of the single-stranded RNA genome found in the virion into the linear double-stranded DNA that is the substrate for the integration process. The synthesis of this linear DNA is a reasonably well-understood process; additional details and references can be found in the books Retroviruses (Telesnitsky and Goff 1997) and Reverse Transcriptase (Skalka and Goff 1993). In orthoretroviruses, including HIV-1, reverse transcription takes place in newly infected cells. There is some debate in the literature about whether reverse transcription is initiated in producer cells. Primer tagging experiments suggest that most HIV-1 virions initiate reverse transcription in newly infected cells (Whitcomb et al. 1990); however, there are claims that a small number of nucleotides may be incorporated before the virions initiate infection of target cells (Lori et al. 1992; Trono 1992; Zhu and Cunningham 1993; Huang et al. 1997). Either way, the vast majority of the viral DNA is synthesized in newly infected cells. This is a lifestyle choice; spumaretroviruses and the more distantly related hepadna viruses carry out extensive reverse transcription in producer cells (Summers and Mason 1982; Yu et al. 1996, 1999). Although there are viral and cellular factors that assist in the process of reverse transcription (these will be discussed later) the two enzymatic activities that are necessary and sufficient to carry out reverse transcription are present in RT. These are a DNA polymerase that can copy either a RNA or a DNA template, and an RNase H that degrades RNA if, and only if, it is part of an RNA\u2013DNA duplex.\nLike many other DNA polymerases, RT needs both a primer and a template.

Despite initial and persistent damage to CD4+ T cells, and a lack of detectable HIV-specific CD4+ T helper cells (Murray et al. 1984; Lane et al. 1985), the magnitude and breadth of CD8+ T-cell responses to HIV in infected humans were found to be robust, with direct effector function of such a magnitude that it could be readily detected in freshly isolated lymphocytes from peripheral blood and brochoalveolar lavage in persons with AIDS (Plata et al. 1987; Walker et al. 1987; Nixon et al. 1988). HIV was already known to be an immunosuppressive disease, yet these cells were present in such robust quantity that they could be detected by assays measuring the ability of freshly isolated peripheral blood cells to lyse autologous B cells infected with recombinant vaccinia-HIV vectors or peptide pulsed targets (Walker et al. 1987; Nixon et al. 1988). Moreover, CD8+ T cells from infected persons were able to inhibit HIV replication (Walker et al. 1986), clearly showing that these cells were functional at least in vitro, but despite this, persons were progressing to AIDS.\nSubsequent studies using other approaches such as interferon \u03b3 Elispot (Dalod et al. 1999), intracellular cytokine (Maecker et al. 2001), and peptide MHC tetramer assays (Altman et al. 1996) confirmed and quantified these robust CD8+ T-cell responses. Most chronically infected persons target more than a dozen CD8+ epitopes simultaneously (Addo et al. 2003), and in some instances up to 19% of CD8+ T cells are specific for HIV (Richardson 2000; Betts et al. 2001; Papagno et al. 2002), yet control of viremia is not achieved. At the same time, HIV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses were found to be severely impaired, particularly as measured by the ability of these cells to proliferate to viral antigens (Wahren et al. 1987). Thus, from the early studies there was a clear disconnect between the lack of HIV-specific CD4+ T cells and the abundance of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells.\nDespite these conundrums, there were early signs that CD8+ T cells play a role in controlling HIV disease progression. Sequencing of autologous virus from infected persons revealed evidence of immune selection pressure mediated by these responses (Phillips et al. 1991) and an association with the initial decline in peak viremia after acute infection (Borrow et al. 1994; Koup et al. 1994). The development of HLA-class I-peptide tetramers confirmed the presence of robust induction of responses to multiple epitopes (Altman et al. 1996), and as larger numbers of patients were studied, it also became clear that among the strongest associations with disease outcome was the expression of certain HLA class I alleles (Kaslow et al. 1996; Migueles et al. 2000; Gao et al. 2001), implicating class I restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) as a major modulator of disease progression. The relationship between CD8+ T-cell immune function and viral control was shown by experimental depletion of CD8+ T cells in animal models of AIDS virus infection (Jin et al. 1999; Schmitz et al. 1999). As sensitive viral load assays became available, it also became clear that some infected persons were able to control viremia to levels below detection by the most sensitive RNA assays, and that these persons were characterized by robust HIV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses (Rosenberg et al. 1997). However, now a quarter century into the epidemic the precise role of T cells in HIV control, and the precise phenotype, specificity and function of T cells that should be induced with a vaccine, remain unclear. And from the standpoint of vaccine development, it remains controversial as to how much insight is to be gained from the study of persons who have become infected, because by definition these are not protective responses.\nAcute HIV infection is often associated with a transient febrile illness, much like infectious mononucleosis (Ho et al. 1985), which has facilitated the identification of persons in the earliest stages of infection, who are HIV RNA positive but not yet HIV antibody positive. Important justification for the intense study of acute infection is the demonstration that early events predict subsequent disease progression (Mellors et al. 1996; Lyles et al. 2000). Acute infection is associated with a decline in peak viremia from \u223c1\u20135 million viral copies/mL to a steady state of \u223c30,000 copies (Lyles et al. 2000), but peak levels of viremia may be much lower in asymptomatic persons (Fiebig et al. 2003). Very few studies have actually examined CD8+ T-cell responses in the earliest stages of infection (Fiebig stage I and II), but when those studies have been performed it is clear that initial immune responses are very narrowly directed (Goonetilleke et al. 2009) and remain narrowly directed as viral set point is achieved (Dalod et al. 1999; Altfeld et al. 2001). Even when responses to autologous virus are measured, the initial detectable response has usually been to only one to three epitopes (Goonetilleke et al. 2009), even though the autologou\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Sequencing of autologous virus from infected persons revealed evidence of immune selection pressure mediated by these responses (Phillips et al. 1991) and an association with the initial decline in peak viremia after acute infection (Borrow et al. 1994; Koup et al. 1994). The development of HLA-class I-peptide tetramers confirmed the presence of robust induction of responses to multiple epitopes (Altman et al. 1996), and as larger numbers of patients were studied, it also became clear that among the strongest associations with disease outcome was the expression of certain HLA class I alleles (Kaslow et al. 1996; Migueles et al. 2000; Gao et al. 2001), implicating class I restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) as a major modulator of disease progression. The relationship between CD8+ T-cell immune function and viral control was shown by experimental depletion of CD8+ T cells in animal models of AIDS virus infection (Jin et al. 1999; Schmitz et al. 1999). As sensitive viral load assays became available, it also became clear that some infected persons were able to control viremia to levels below detection by the most sensitive RNA assays, and that these persons were characterized by robust HIV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses (Rosenberg et al. 1997). However, now a quarter century into the epidemic the precise role of T cells in HIV control, and the precise phenotype, specificity and function of T cells that should be induced with a vaccine, remain unclear. And from the standpoint of vaccine development, it remains controversial as to how much insight is to be gained from the study of persons who have become infected, because by definition these are not protective responses.\nAcute HIV infection is often associated with a transient febrile illness, much like infectious mononucleosis (Ho et al. 1985), which has facilitated the identification of persons in the earliest stages of infection, who are HIV RNA positive but not yet HIV antibody positive. Important justification for the intense study of acute infection is the demonstration that early events predict subsequent disease progression (Mellors et al. 1996; Lyles et al. 2000). Acute infection is associated with a decline in peak viremia from \u223c1\u20135 million viral copies/mL to a steady state of \u223c30,000 copies (Lyles et al. 2000), but peak levels of viremia may be much lower in asymptomatic persons (Fiebig et al. 2003). Very few studies have actually examined CD8+ T-cell responses in the earliest stages of infection (Fiebig stage I and II), but when those studies have been performed it is clear that initial immune responses are very narrowly directed (Goonetilleke et al. 2009) and remain narrowly directed as viral set point is achieved (Dalod et al. 1999; Altfeld et al. 2001).

HIV infects and deletes CD4+ T cells that normally coordinate the adaptive T- and B-cell response to defend against intracellular pathogens. The immune defect is immediate and profound: At the time of acute infection with an AIDS virus, typically more than half of the gut-associated CD4+ T cells are depleted, leaving a damaged immune system to contend with a life-long infection.\nAt the time of acute HIV infection, more than half of the gut-associated CD4+ T cells are depleted, leaving a damaged immune system to contend with a life-long infection.\nThe earliest studies of T-cell function among infected persons revealed aspects of HIV immunopathogenesis that are still not fully understood. Despite initial and persistent damage to CD4+ T cells, and a lack of detectable HIV-specific CD4+ T helper cells (Murray et al. 1984; Lane et al. 1985), the magnitude and breadth of CD8+ T-cell responses to HIV in infected humans were found to be robust, with direct effector function of such a magnitude that it could be readily detected in freshly isolated lymphocytes from peripheral blood and brochoalveolar lavage in persons with AIDS (Plata et al. 1987; Walker et al. 1987; Nixon et al. 1988). HIV was already known to be an immunosuppressive disease, yet these cells were present in such robust quantity that they could be detected by assays measuring the ability of freshly isolated peripheral blood cells to lyse autologous B cells infected with recombinant vaccinia-HIV vectors or peptide pulsed targets (Walker et al. 1987; Nixon et al. 1988). Moreover, CD8+ T cells from infected persons were able to inhibit HIV replication (Walker et al. 1986), clearly showing that these cells were functional at least in vitro, but despite this, persons were progressing to AIDS.\nSubsequent studies using other approaches such as interferon \u03b3 Elispot (Dalod et al. 1999), intracellular cytokine (Maecker et al. 2001), and peptide MHC tetramer assays (Altman et al. 1996) confirmed and quantified these robust CD8+ T-cell responses. Most chronically infected persons target more than a dozen CD8+ epitopes simultaneously (Addo et al. 2003), and in some instances up to 19% of CD8+ T cells are specific for HIV (Richardson 2000; Betts et al. 2001; Papagno et al. 2002), yet control of viremia is not achieved. At the same time, HIV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses were found to be severely impaired, particularly as measured by the ability of these cells to proliferate to viral antigens (Wahren et al. 1987). Thus, from the early studies there was a clear disconnect between the lack of HIV-specific CD4+ T cells and the abundance of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells.\nDespite these conundrums, there were early signs that CD8+ T cells play a role in controlling HIV disease progression.

This article presents an overview of reverse transcription, briefly describes the structure and function of RT, provides an introduction to some of the cellular and viral factors that can affect reverse transcription, and discusses fidelity and recombination, two processes in which reverse transcription plays an important role. In keeping with the theme of the collection, the emphasis is on HIV-1 and HIV-1 RT.\nMore than half of the drugs currently approved to treat HIV-1 infections are reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Therefore, the continued characterization of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and the process of reverse transcription is vital.\nIt has been 40 years since the discovery of reverse transcriptase (RT) was announced by Howard Temin and David Baltimore, who independently showed that retroviral virions contain an enzymatic activity that can copy RNA into DNA (Baltimore 1970; Mizutani et al. 1970). These experiments provided the crucial proof of Temin\u2019s provirus hypothesis that retroviral infections persist because the RNA genome found in the virions is converted into DNA (Temin 1964). The sequences of the genomes of eukaryotes show how pervasive reverse transcription is in nature; not only do these genomes contain large numbers of endogenous retroviruses, but also a variety of retroposons and reverse-transcribed elements. The discovery in the early 1980s, that AIDS is caused by a human retrovirus, HIV-1, invigorated retroviral research and focused attention on the viral enzymes, which have become the primary target of anti-AIDS drugs. Not surprisingly, the focus of RT research shifted from the RTs of the murine leukemia viruses (MLV) and the avian myeloblastosis virus to HIV-1 RT. The first approved anti-HIV drug, AZT, targets RT, and of the 26 drugs currently approved to treat HIV-1 infections, 14 are RT inhibitors. In addition, RTs (primarily recombinant MLV RTs) have become extremely valuable tools that are widely used in research, in clinical/diagnostic tests, and in biotechnology. We provide here a relatively brief description of the process of reverse transcription, the structure and biochemical functions of RT, some information about how other viral and cellular factors influence reverse transcription, and briefly consider how the reverse transcription process affects both the mutations that arise during the retroviral life cycle and recombination. The focus will be HIV-1 and HIV-1 RT; however, in some cases, we will draw on insights and include information obtained with other retroviruses and other RTs. Although the issues of the inhibition of HIV-1 RT by anti-RT drugs and the mechanisms of drug resistance are of considerable importance, these issues will not be addressed in detail here; the reader is directed to Arts and Hazuda (2011). Given that the literature on RT and reverse transcription is both vast and complex, and the space allowed for this article is limited, we have had to make some difficult choices in what to present, and what to omit, both in terms of the material and the references. For the omissions, we apologize.\nWhen a mature HIV-1 virion infects a susceptible target cell, interactions of the envelope glycoprotein with the coreceptors on the surface of the cell brings about a fusion of the membranes of the host cell and the virion (Wilen et al. 2011). This fusion introduces the contents of the virion into the cytoplasm of the cell, setting the stage for reverse transcription. There are complexities to the early events that accompany reverse transcription in an infected cell, not all of which are well understood, which will be considered later in this article. We will begin by discussing the mechanics of the conversion of the single-stranded RNA genome found in the virion into the linear double-stranded DNA that is the substrate for the integration process. The synthesis of this linear DNA is a reasonably well-understood process; additional details and references can be found in the books Retroviruses (Telesnitsky and Goff 1997) and Reverse Transcriptase (Skalka and Goff 1993). In orthoretroviruses, including HIV-1, reverse transcription takes place in newly infected cells. There is some debate in the literature about whether reverse transcription is initiated in producer cells. Primer tagging experiments suggest that most HIV-1 virions initiate reverse transcription in newly infected cells (Whitcomb et al. 1990); however, there are claims that a small number of nucleotides may be incorporated before the virions initiate infection of target cells (Lori et al. 1992; Trono 1992; Zhu and Cunningham 1993; Huang et al. 1997). Either way, the vast majority of the viral DNA is synthesized in newly infected cells. This is a lifestyle choice; spumaretroviruses and the more distantly related hepadna viruses carry out extensive reverse transcription in producer cells (Summers and Mason 1982; Yu et al. 1996, 1999). Although there are viral and cellular factors that assist in the process of reverse transcription (these will be discussed later) the two enzymatic activities that are necessary and sufficient to carry out reverse transcription are present in RT. These are a DNA polymerase that can copy either a RNA or a DNA template, and an RNase H that degrades RNA if, and only if, it is part of an RNA\u2013DNA duplex.\nLike many other DNA polymerases, RT needs both a primer and a template.

Either way, the vast majority of the viral DNA is synthesized in newly infected cells. This is a lifestyle choice; spumaretroviruses and the more distantly related hepadna viruses carry out extensive reverse transcription in producer cells (Summers and Mason 1982; Yu et al. 1996, 1999). Although there are viral and cellular factors that assist in the process of reverse transcription (these will be discussed later) the two enzymatic activities that are necessary and sufficient to carry out reverse transcription are present in RT. These are a DNA polymerase that can copy either a RNA or a DNA template, and an RNase H that degrades RNA if, and only if, it is part of an RNA\u2013DNA duplex.\nLike many other DNA polymerases, RT needs both a primer and a template. Genomic RNA is plus-stranded (the genome and the messages are copied from the same DNA strand), and the primer for the synthesis of the first DNA strand (the minus strand) is a host tRNA whose 3\u2032 end is base paired to a compl\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

If CD4 levels are low, this may indicate that HIV has progressed into AIDS.\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nHIV is a disease in which the original clinical observations of severe opportunistic infections gave the first clues regarding the underlying pathology, namely that HIV is essentially an infection of the immune system. HIV infects and deletes CD4+ T cells that normally coordinate the adaptive T- and B-cell response to defend against intracellular pathogens. The immune defect is immediate and profound: At the time of acute infection with an AIDS virus, typically more than half of the gut-associated CD4+ T cells are depleted, leaving a damaged immune system to contend with a life-long infection.\nAt the time of acute HIV infection, more than half of the gut-associated CD4+ T cells are depleted, leaving a damaged immune system to contend with a life-long infection.\nThe earliest studies of T-cell function among infected persons revealed aspects of HIV immunopathogenesis that are still not fully understood. Despite initial and persistent damage to CD4+ T cells, and a lack of detectable HIV-specific CD4+ T helper cells (Murray et al. 1984; Lane et al. 1985), the magnitude and breadth of CD8+ T-cell responses to HIV in infected humans were found to be robust, with direct effector function of such a magnitude that it could be readily detected in freshly isolated lymphocytes from peripheral blood and brochoalveolar lavage in persons with AIDS (Plata et al. 1987; Walker et al. 1987; Nixon et al. 1988). HIV was already known to be an immunosuppressive disease, yet these cells were present in such robust quantity that they could be detected by assays measuring the ability of freshly isolated peripheral blood cells to lyse autologous B cells infected with recombinant vaccinia-HIV vectors or peptide pulsed targets (Walker et al. 1987; Nixon et al. 1988). Moreover, CD8+ T cells from infected persons were able to inhibit HIV replication (Walker et al. 1986), clearly showing that these cells were functional at least in vitro, but despite this, persons were progressing to AIDS.\nSubsequent studies using other approaches such as interferon \u03b3 Elispot (Dalod et al. 1999), intracellular cytokine (Maecker et al. 2001), and peptide MHC tetramer assays (Altman et al. 1996) confirmed and quantified these robust CD8+ T-cell responses. Most chronically infected persons target more than a dozen CD8+ epitopes simultaneously (Addo et al. 2003), and in some instances up to 19% of CD8+ T cells are specific for HIV (Richardson 2000; Betts et al. 2001; Papagno et al. 2002), yet control of viremia is not achieved. At the same time, HIV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses were found to be severely impaired, particularly as measured by the ability of these cells to proliferate to viral antigens (Wahren et al. 1987). Thus, from the early studies there was a clear disconnect between the lack of HIV-specific CD4+ T cells and the abundance of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells.\nDespite these conundrums, there were early signs that CD8+ T cells play a role in controlling HIV disease progression. Sequencing of autologous virus from infected persons revealed evidence of immune selection pressure mediated by these responses (Phillips et al. 1991) and an association with the initial decline in peak viremia after acute infection (Borrow et al. 1994; Koup et al. 1994). The development of HLA-class I-peptide tetramers confirmed the presence of robust induction of responses to multiple epitopes (Altman et al. 1996), and as larger numbers of patients were studied, it also became clear that among the strongest associations with disease outcome was the expression of certain HLA class I alleles (Kaslow et al. 1996; Migueles et al. 2000; Gao et al. 2001), implicating class I restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) as a major modulator of disease progression. The relationship between CD8+ T-cell immune function and viral control was shown by experimental depletion of CD8+ T cells in animal models of AIDS virus infection (Jin et al. 1999; Schmitz et al. 1999). As sensitive viral load assays became available, it also became clear that some infected persons were able to control viremia to levels below detection by the most sensitive RNA assays, and that these persons were characterized by robust HIV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses (Rosenberg et al. 1997). However, now a quarter century into the epidemic the precise role of T cells in HIV control, and the precise phenotype, specificity and function of T cells that should be induced with a vaccine, remain unclear. And from the standpoint of vaccine development, it remains controversial as to how much insight is to be gained from the study of persons who have become infected, because by definition these are not protective responses.\nAcute HIV infection is often associated with a transient febrile illness, much like infectious mononucleosis (Ho et al. 1985), which has facilitated the identification of persons in the earliest stages of infection, who are HIV RNA positive but not yet HIV antibody positive. Important justification for the intense study of acute infection is the demonstration that early events predict subsequent disease progression (Mellors et al. 1996; Lyles et al. 2000). Acute infection is associated with a decline in peak viremia from \u223c1\u20135 million viral copies/mL to a steady state of \u223c30,000 copies (Lyles et al. 2000), but peak levels of viremia may be much lower in asymptomatic persons (Fiebig et al. 2003). Very few studies have actually examined CD8+ T-cell responses in the earliest stages of infection (Fiebig stage I and II), but when those studies have been performed it is clear that initial immune responses are very narrowly directed (Goonetilleke et al. 2009) and remain narrowly directed as viral set point is achieved (Dalod et al. 1999; Altfeld et al. 2001).

People with weakened immune systems include people with HIV or cancer, or those who receive organ transplants.\nOIs are caused by a variety of germs (viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites) that can be spread in many ways, like through the air, body fluids, or contaminated food or water.\nSome OIs that people with HIV may get include candidiasis, Salmonella infection, toxoplasmosis, and tuberculosis (TB). In some cases, people may already have an inactive disease (such as latent tuberculosis) that becomes active as their immune system gets weaker, due to untreated conditions like HIV.\nThe Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents With HIV provide detailed information on HIV-related OIs.\nOnce a person has HIV, the virus begins to multiply and damage the immune system. A weakened immune system makes it harder for the body to fight off OIs, which take advantage of a person\u2019s weakened immune defenses.\nHIV medicines prevent HIV from damaging the immune system. But without treatment with HIV medicines, HIV can gradually destroy the immune system and progress to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Many OIs (such as certain forms of pneumonia and TB) and some cancers are considered AIDS-defining conditions, which are life-threatening in people with HIV.\nBecause HIV medicines are widely used in the United States, OIs have become less common among people with HIV than in previous years. However, OIs are still a problem for many people with HIV. Some people with HIV get OIs for the following reasons:\nFor people with HIV, the best protection against OIs is to take HIV medicines exactly as prescribed and to attend follow-up appointments regularly to make sure an HIV treatment regimen is working effectively.\nIn addition to taking HIV medicines exactly as prescribed, people with HIV can take the following steps to reduce their risk of getting an OI.\nThe germs that can cause OIs can spread in a variety of ways, including in body fluids or in feces. To avoid sexually transmitted infections (STIs), use condoms every time you have sex. If you inject drugs, do not share drug injection equipment. After any contact with human or animal feces, wash your hands thoroughly with warm, soapy water.\nAsk your health care provider about other ways to avoid the germs that can cause OIs.\nFood and water can be contaminated with OI-causing germs. To be safe, do not eat certain foods (including undercooked eggs, unpasteurized dairy products or fruit juices, or raw seed sprouts) and do not drink water directly from a lake or river.\nFor more tips on how to avoid OI-causing germs, read the HIVinfo HIV and Nutrition and Food Safety fact sheet.\nBefore you travel, talk to your health care provider about your travel plans to learn about ways you can avoid getting sick. Your health care provider might recommend that you get vaccinated or take certain medicines to prevent OIs that are common in the country you are going to visit. For instance, if a person with HIV is traveling to an area with high rates of malaria (such as Brazil or India), they may be advised to take mefloquine or another antimalarial medicine before traveling.\nRead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) fact sheet on Living With HIV.\nTalk to your health care provider about which vaccines you need. To learn more, read the HIVinfo fact sheet on HIV and Immunizations.\nThere are many medicines to treat OIs, including antiviral, antibiotic, antifungal, and antiparasitic drugs. The type of medicine used depends on the type of germ that caused the OI.\nSome HIV medicines and conditions like diabetes or kidney disease may impact how effective the OI medicine is. Likewise, some OI medicines may impact how effective the HIV medicine is. When prescribing OI medicines, health care providers consider these and other factors to avoid unwanted drug interactions. Generally, OI drugs are more effective in people who stick to their HIV regimen (and therefore have control of their HIV) than those who are untreated or have advanced HIV.\nOnce an OI is successfully treated, a person may need to continue using the same medicine or switch to another medicine to prevent the OI from coming back.\nThe Clinicalinfo Drug Database includes information on many of the medicines used to prevent and treat OIs.\nThis fact sheet is based on information from the following sources:\nFrom CDC:\nFrom MedlinePlus:\nFrom the HIV Clinical Practice Guidelines at Clinicalinfo.HIV.gov:\nFrom the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs:\nAlso see the HIV Source collection of HIV links and resources.\nProvided in collaboration with NIH\u2019s Office of AIDS Research.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

HIV infects and destroys immune cells called CD4 T cells or T helper cells. Overtime the number of your immune cells will decrease as they are killed by the virus, which leads to AIDS. AIDS is when your immune system is significantly weakened by the virus, and you start to experience complications of a weakened immune system. Today, HIV treatment is highly effective at preventing HIV infection from progressing to AIDS and allowing people living with HIV to lead long lives.\nGlobally: In 2024, 40.8 million people worldwide were living with HIV and 1.3 million new people became infected with the virus.\nUS incidence: In 2024, 1.2 million people in the US were living with HIV and 31,800 new people became infected with the virus.\nSince the beginning of the HIV epidemic in 1981, 91.4 million people have been infected with the virus and 44.1 million have died from HIV-related causes.\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus that infects and destroys immune cells. HIV spreads through contact with bodily fluids including blood, semen, vaginal fluids, and breastmilk. This means HIV can spread through activities such as unprotected sex, sharing needles or syringes, or from mother to baby.\nOnce HIV enters the body, it infects T helper cells (also known as CD4 T cells). When HIV enters a T helper cell, it permanently inserts its viral DNA into the cell\u2019s DNA. The virus has now hijacked the T helper cell, using it to make more copies of the virus. The viral DNA from HIV also becomes permanently part of an infected T helper cell\u2019s DNA. This makes it very difficult for the immune system to find and kill the virus. Because of HIV\u2019s ability to quickly hide within your cells and because it mutates very often, developing a vaccine to prevent HIV is very challenging.\nThe first stage of HIV infection is called acute HIV. This is when someone is first infected with HIV and may experience mild flu-like symptoms or no symptoms at all. This can then progress to chronic infection where HIV will continue to replicate inside T helper cells, slowly killing them and infecting more cells. At this stage, it\u2019s likely that the infected person won\u2019t experience any noticeable symptoms. During this time, they can still transmit HIV, even if they don\u2019t realize they have it.\nHIV infection can affect anyone. To learn more or be tested for the virus, talk to a doctor or visit a local health clinic.\nThe final stage of HIV infection is acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). This is when the number of T helper cells becomes very low. This happens years after initial infection and the immune system has been severely weakened by the virus. The T helper cells that HIV infects and destroys are crucial for activating other immune cells to coordinate an immune response. As the number of T helper cells decreases, the immune system becomes weaker, unable to fight off simple infections or prevent the development of cancer.\nA person with AIDS is more likely to get opportunistic infections, which are infections a healthy immune system could normally prevent. They are also more likely to develop certain types of cancer. These infections and cancers are called AIDS-defining illnesses. They occur because the T helper cells that are supposed to help initiate immune responses are too weak to respond. Some examples include Kaposi sarcoma, tuberculosis, or chronic herpes ulcers.\nHIV treatment and prevention have come a long way, but there is no cure. Today, HIV treatment can prevent HIV infection from progressing to AIDS. When taking HIV treatment as prescribed, many people live long lives. Treatment can even reduce HIV to undetectable levels in person, meaning there is so little virus active in your blood that a test cannot detect it. This doesn\u2019t mean you are cured, but it does mean your treatment is working very effectively. Researchers have even determined that when HIV levels are undetectable and stay undetectable, the virus cannot be transmitted.

HIV infects and destroys immune cells called CD4 T cells or T helper cells. Overtime the number of your immune cells will decrease as they are killed by the virus, which leads to AIDS. AIDS is when your immune system is significantly weakened by the virus, and you start to experience complications of a weakened immune system. Today, HIV treatment is highly effective at preventing HIV infection from progressing to AIDS and allowing people living with HIV to lead long lives.\nGlobally: In 2024, 40.8 million people worldwide were living with HIV and 1.3 million new people became infected with the virus.\nUS incidence: In 2024, 1.2 million people in the US were living with HIV and 31,800 new people became infected with the virus.\nSince the beginning of the HIV epidemic in 1981, 91.4 million people have been infected with the virus and 44.1 million have died from HIV-related causes.\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus that infects and destroys immune cells. HIV spreads through contact with bodily fluids including blood, semen, vaginal fluids, and breastmilk. This means HIV can spread through activities such as unprotected sex, sharing needles or syringes, or from mother to baby.\nOnce HIV enters the body, it infects T helper cells (also known as CD4 T cells). When HIV enters a T helper cell, it permanently inserts its viral DNA into the cell\u2019s DNA. The virus has now hijacked the T helper cell, using it to make more copies of the virus. The viral DNA from HIV also becomes permanently part of an infected T helper cell\u2019s DNA. This makes it very difficult for the immune system to find and kill the virus. Because of HIV\u2019s ability to quickly hide within your cells and because it mutates very often, developing a vaccine to prevent HIV is very challenging.\nThe first stage of HIV infection is called acute HIV. This is when someone is first infected with HIV and may experience mild flu-like symptoms or no symptoms at all. This can then progress to chronic infection where HIV will continue to replicate inside T helper cells, slowly killing them and infecting more cells. At this stage, it\u2019s likely that the infected person won\u2019t experience any noticeable symptoms. During this time, they can still transmit HIV, even if they don\u2019t realize they have it.\nHIV infection can affect anyone. To learn more or be tested for the virus, talk to a doctor or visit a local health clinic.\nThe final stage of HIV infection is acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). This is when the number of T helper cells becomes very low. This happens years after initial infection and the immune system has been severely weakened by the virus. The T helper cells that HIV infects and destroys are crucial for activating other immune cells to coordinate an immune response. As the number of T helper cells decreases, the immune system becomes weaker, unable to fight off simple infections or prevent the development of cancer.\nA person with AIDS is more likely to get opportunistic infections, which are infections a healthy immune system could normally prevent. They are also more likely to develop certain types of cancer. These infections and cancers are called AIDS-defining illnesses. They occur because the T helper cells that are supposed to help initiate immune responses are too weak to respond. Some examples include Kaposi sarcoma, tuberculosis, or chronic herpes ulcers.\nHIV treatment and prevention have come a long way, but there is no cure. Today, HIV treatment can prevent HIV infection from progressing to AIDS. When taking HIV treatment as prescribed, many people live long lives. Treatment can even reduce HIV to undetectable levels in person, meaning there is so little virus active in your blood that a test cannot detect it. This doesn\u2019t mean you are cured, but it does mean your treatment is working very effectively. Researchers have even determined that when HIV levels are undetectable and stay undetectable, the virus cannot be transmitted. Immunology research over the last 40 years contributed to these major advancements in HIV treatment that allow people to live decades with little to no symptoms of HIV infection.\nImmunology research is continuing to advance HIV treatments and even help find a cure for the infection. Immunotherapy, treatment that enhances the immune system\u2019s ability to fight disease, is providing promise for people with HIV. A study in 2022, found that a cancer immunotherapy, pembrolizumab, can reverse HIV\u2019s ability to hide in immune cells. The virus\u2019s ability to hide is a major barrier to curing HIV, and immunotherapies like this may be a key step in reaching a cure.\nmRNA vaccines are also showing incredible promise in curing HIV.

Justiz Vaillant; Roopa Naik.\nLast Update: January 27, 2023.\nHIV-1 associated opportunistic infections encompass a myriad of life-threatening infections seen in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus who are generally not on anti-retroviral therapy (ART). These infections typically affect patients with low CD4+ counts. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of the most commonly encountered HIV-1 associated opportunistic infections and highlights the role of an interprofessional team in the management of afflicted patients.\nObjectives:\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus known to attack the CD4+ T lymphocytes. Of the two subtypes, HIV-1 and HIV-2, the former is common and prevalent worldwide, and the latter is confined to West Africa and hence less common. In individuals with chronic HIV infection not on treatment with antiretroviral agents, as the CD4+ count drops they are vulnerable to a multitude of infections which rarely occur in an immunocompetent host, hence the term opportunistic infections (OIs). The presence of an AIDS-defining illness or CD4+ less than 200 cells/mm\u00b3 is necessary for defining AIDS and the literature describes potentially fatal opportunistic infections in these patients which are often challenging to treat.\nHIV infected individuals, even with high CD4+ cell counts, are at a higher risk of developing both common and OIs than the general population. However, in HIV patients with CD4+ cell counts less than 200 cells per millimeter, the risk of developing OIs and subsequent death remains the highest.[1] These individuals are prone to a wide variety of bacterial, viral, fungal and protozoal infections which include Toxoplasma gondii, Pneumocystis jirovecii (previously Pneumocystis carinii), Cryptococcus neoformans, Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Cytomegalovirus, Herpes simplex viruses, Histoplasma capsulatum.\nIn 2015, 1.1 million people were estimated to be living in the US with HIV.[2] It has an estimated worldwide prevalence of 36.7 million as of 2017. Health authorities recognize the disease as a global health problem. Transmission of HIV infection is common via unprotected sexual contact, highest in male-to-male sexual contact in the US with a reported 70% of new HIV infections, followed by injection drug users, contaminated blood transfusions. Vertical transmission during or after birth from the mother to the newborn may also occur. The successful initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has lowered the occurrence of HIV-related opportunistic infections. However, patients who present in the late stages of HIV or are unable to maintain viral suppression remain a high risk for opportunistic infections.\nAn HIV-1 virion consists of two identical strands of RNA and associated enzymes, including reverse transcriptase packaged in a cone-shaped core composed of p24 capsid protein with a surrounding p17 protein matrix, all enclosed by a phospholipid membrane envelope derived from the host cell. Glycoproteins, gp41 and gp120, are bound to the envelope. CD4+ and chemokine receptors on the host cell surface function as HIV-1 receptors.\nThe HIV life cycle starts with the virion binding to CD4+ and chemokine receptor. Fusion of HIV membrane with cell membrane occurs, followed by the entry of the viral genome into the cytoplasm. Reverse transcriptase mediates the synthesis of proviral DNA leading to the integration of provirus into the cell genome. Subsequently, cytokine activation of the cell, transcription of HIV genome, transport of spliced and unspliced RNAs to cytoplasm occur. Synthesis of HIV proteins and assembly takes place and finally the expression of gp120/gp41 on the cell surface, and budding of mature virion transpires. An infected cell produces many virions that are capable of infecting CD4+ cells, macrophages, and neurons, thereby amplifying the infectious cycle.\nThe pathognomonic feature of HIV is the progressive reduction in the CD4+ T cells, leading to the destruction of both cell-mediated and antibody-mediated immune mechanisms.\nHistory and physical should aim at localizing the affected organ system, concurrently with the CD4+ cell counts. Since these opportunistic infections are manifested depending on the severity of the suppression of CD4+ counts, for this review, they have been categorized accordingly.\nAll CD4+ counts\nMycobacterium tuberculosis:\nFollowing infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacilli can persist for years, referred to as latent TB infection (LTBI). An estimated 3 to 16% of untreated HIV patients have the annual risk of reactivation with TB disease, whereas the lifetime risk among HIV-negative persons with LTBI is about approximately 5%.[3] This organism can involve every organ system. Symptoms include fatigue, weakness, weight loss, and fever. Pulmonary tuberculosis features chronic cough and spitting of blood. Meningitis and urinary tract involvement may occur. Disseminated bloodstream infections lead to lesions in many organs (miliary tuberculosis) and are associated with a high mortality rate.\nCD4+ count less than 250 cells/mm^3\nCoccidioidomycosis:\nConsists of two species, Coccidioidesimmitis, and Coccidioides posadasii, found in soil. Four different syndromes are noted: (1) focal pneumonia presenting with fever, cough and pleuritic chest pain, (2) diffuse pneumonia with fever, dyspnea, hypoxemia, (3) meningitis with headache, lethargy, and (4) positive serology tests without evidence of localized infection.[4]\nCD4+ count < 200 cells/mm^3\nPneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP):\nThis fungus, until recently, was thought to be a protozoan. History of fever, progressive dyspnea, non-productive cough and hypoxemia on the exam are characteristic.

These infections typically affect patients with low CD4+ counts. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of the most commonly encountered HIV-1 associated opportunistic infections and highlights the role of an interprofessional team in the management of afflicted patients.\nObjectives:\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus known to attack the CD4+ T lymphocytes. Of the two subtypes, HIV-1 and HIV-2, the former is common and prevalent worldwide, and the latter is confined to West Africa and hence less common. In individuals with chronic HIV infection not on treatment with antiretroviral agents, as the CD4+ count drops they are vulnerable to a multitude of infections which rarely occur in an immunocompetent host, hence the term opportunistic infections (OIs). The presence of an AIDS-defining illness or CD4+ less than 200 cells/mm\u00b3 is necessary for defining AIDS and the literature describes potentially fatal opportunistic infections in these patients which are often challenging to treat.\nHIV infected individuals, even with high CD4+ cell counts, are at a higher risk of developing both common and OIs than the general population. However, in HIV patients with CD4+ cell counts less than 200 cells per millimeter, the risk of developing OIs and subsequent death remains the highest.[1] These individuals are prone to a wide variety of bacterial, viral, fungal and protozoal infections which include Toxoplasma gondii, Pneumocystis jirovecii (previously Pneumocystis carinii), Cryptococcus neoformans, Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Cytomegalovirus, Herpes simplex viruses, Histoplasma capsulatum.\nIn 2015, 1.1 million people were estimated to be living in the US with HIV.[2] It has an estimated worldwide prevalence of 36.7 million as of 2017. Health authorities recognize the disease as a global health problem. Transmission of HIV infection is common via unprotected sexual contact, highest in male-to-male sexual contact in the US with a reported 70% of new HIV infections, followed by injection drug users, contaminated blood transfusions. Vertical transmission during or after birth from the mother to the newborn may also occur. The successful initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has lowered the occurrence of HIV-related opportunistic infections. However, patients who present in the late stages of HIV or are unable to maintain viral suppression remain a high risk for opportunistic infections.\nAn HIV-1 virion consists of two identical strands of RNA and associated enzymes, including reverse transcriptase packaged in a cone-shaped core composed of p24 capsid protein with a surrounding p17 protein matrix, all enclosed by a phospholipid membrane envelope derived from the host cell. Glycoproteins, gp41 and gp120, are bound to the envelope. CD4+ and chemokine receptors on the host cell surface function as HIV-1 receptors.\nThe HIV life cycle starts with the virion binding to CD4+ and chemokine receptor. Fusion of HIV membrane with cell membrane occurs, followed by the entry of the viral genome into the cytoplasm. Reverse transcriptase mediates the synthesis of proviral DNA leading to the integration of provirus into the cell genome. Subsequently, cytokine activation of the cell, transcription of HIV genome, transport of spliced and unspliced RNAs to cytoplasm occur. Synthesis of HIV proteins and assembly takes place and finally the expression of gp120/gp41 on the cell surface, and budding of mature virion transpires. An infected cell produces many virions that are capable of infecting CD4+ cells, macrophages, and neurons, thereby amplifying the infectious cycle.\nThe pathognomonic feature of HIV is the progressive reduction in the CD4+ T cells, leading to the destruction of both cell-mediated and antibody-mediated immune mechanisms.\nHistory and physical should aim at localizing the affected organ system, concurrently with the CD4+ cell counts. Since these opportunistic infections are manifested depending on the severity of the suppression of CD4+ counts, for this review, they have been categorized accordingly.\nAll CD4+ counts\nMycobacterium tuberculosis:\nFollowing infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacilli can persist for years, referred to as latent TB infection (LTBI). An estimated 3 to 16% of untreated HIV patients have the annual risk of reactivation with TB disease, whereas the lifetime risk among HIV-negative persons with LTBI is about approximately 5%.[3] This organism can involve every organ system. Symptoms include fatigue, weakness, weight loss, and fever. Pulmonary tuberculosis features chronic cough and spitting of blood. Meningitis and urinary tract involvement may occur. Disseminated bloodstream infections lead to lesions in many organs (miliary tuberculosis) and are associated with a high mortality rate.\nCD4+ count less than 250 cells/mm^3\nCoccidioidomycosis:\nConsists of two species, Coccidioidesimmitis, and Coccidioides posadasii, found in soil.
