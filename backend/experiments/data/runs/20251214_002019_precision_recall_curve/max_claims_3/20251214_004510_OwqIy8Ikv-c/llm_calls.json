    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nI\u2019m an atmospheric physicist. I\u2019ve published more than 200 scientific papers. For 30 years I taught at MIT, during which time the climate has changed remarkably little. But the cry of \u201cglobal warming\u201d has grown ever more shrill. In fact, it seems that the less the climate changes, the louder the voices of the climate alarmists get. So, let\u2019s clear the air and create a more accurate picture of where we really stand on the issue of global warming or, as it is now called -- climate change. There are basically three groups of people dealing with this issue. Groups one and two are scientists. Group three consists mostly, at its core, of politicians, environmentalists and media. Group one is associated with the scientific part of the United Nation\u2019s International Panel on Climate Change or IPCC (Working Group 1). These are scientists who mostly believe that recent climate change is primarily due to man\u2019s burning of fossil fuels -- oil, coal and natural gas. This releases C02, carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere and, they believe, this might eventually dangerously heat the planet. Group two is made up of scientists who don\u2019t see this as an especially serious problem. This is the group I belong to. We\u2019re usually referred to as skeptics. We note that there are many reasons why the climate changes -- the sun, clouds, oceans, the orbital variations of the earth, as well as a myriad of other inputs. None of these is fully understood, and there is no evidence that CO2 emissions are the dominant factor. But actually there is much agreement between both groups of scientists. The following are such points of agreement: 1) The climate is always changing. 2) CO2 is a greenhouse gas without which life on earth is not possible, but adding it to the atmosphere should lead to some warming. 3) Atmospheric levels of CO2 have been increasing since the end of the Little Ice Age in the 19th century. 4) Over this period (the past two centuries), the global mean temperature has increased slightly and erratically by about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit or one degree Celsius; but only since the 1960\u2019s have man\u2019s greenhouse emissions been sufficient to play a role. 5) Given the complexity of climate, no confident prediction about future global mean temperature or its impact can be made. The IPCC, acknowledged in its own 2007 report that \u201cThe long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible.\u201d Most importantly, the scenario that the burning of fossil fuels leads to catastrophe isn\u2019t part of what either group asserts. So why are so many people worried, indeed, panic stricken about this issue. Here\u2019s where Group Three comes in -- the politicians, environmentalists, and media. Global Warming Alarmism provides them, more than any other issue, with the things they most want: For politicians it\u2019s money and power. For environmentalists it\u2019s money for their organizations and confirmation of their near religious devotion to the idea that man is a destructive force acting upon nature. And for the media it\u2019s ideology, money, and headlines -- doomsday scenarios sell. Meanwhile, over the last decade, scientists outside of climate physics have jumped on the bandwagon, publishing papers blaming global warming for everything from acne to the Syrian civil war. And, crony capitalists have eagerly grabbed for the subsidies that governments have so lavishly provided. Unfortunately, group three is winning the argument because they have drowned out the serious debate that should be going on. But while politicians, environmentalists and media types can waste a lot of money and scare a lot of people, they won\u2019t be able to bury the truth. The climate will have the final word on that.

However, ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nThe Environmental Protection Agency has altered and removed information from its website that connected climate change to the burning of fossil fuels.\nThe changes come as the Trump administration tries to supercharge US oil and gas production and resurrect the coal industry. Now, the EPA\u2019s webpage detailing the \u2018causes of climate change\u2019 no longer lists human activities such as burning oil, gas and coal \u2014 the key drivers of a warming climate since the industrial revolution.\nIn some cases, the agency has left information that implies the existence of human-caused climate change, while removing direct references to that fact. Other EPA webpages, including one explaining the \u2018future of climate change,\u2019 still mention the link between humans burning fossil fuels and a changing climate.\nThe \u2018causes of climate change\u2019 page, for example, now reads, \u201cNatural processes are always influencing the earth\u2019s climate and can explain climate changes prior to the Industrial Revolution in the 1700s,\u201d before listing such issues as changes in Earth\u2019s orbit, variations in solar activity and volcanic activity. \u201cHowever, recent climate changes cannot be explained by natural causes alone.\u201d\nPreviously, that webpage contained an entire section on the human causes of climate change and cited the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s statement that \u201cIt is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land.\u201d That section is now missing.\nChanges to the site were made sometime after early October, according to Internet Archive\u2019s webpage archive website Wayback Machine.\nIn addition, the agency\u2019s webpages on \u2018climate change indicators\u2019 are no longer active.

While natural variability plays some part, the preponderance of evidence indicates that human activities\u2014particularly emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases\u2014are mostly responsible for making our planet warmer.\nAccording to an ongoing temperature analysis led by scientists at NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), the average global temperature on Earth has increased by at least 1.1\u00b0 Celsius (1.9\u00b0 Fahrenheit) since 1880. The majority of the warming has occurred since 1975, at a rate of roughly 0.15 to 0.20\u00b0C per decade.\nThe maps above show temperature anomalies in five-year increments since 1880. (Click on the arrow to run the animation.) These are not absolute temperatures, but changes from the norm for each area. The data reflect how much warmer or cooler each region was compared to a base period of 1951-1980. (The global mean surface air temperature for that period was 14\u00b0C (57\u00b0F), with an uncertainty of several tenths of a degree.)\nThe image below shows global temperature anomalies in 2022, which tied for the fifth warmest year on record. The past nine years have been the warmest years since modern recordkeeping began in 1880.\nAs the maps show, global warming does not mean temperatures rise everywhere at every time by same rate. Temperatures might rise 5 degrees in one region and drop 2 degrees in another. For instance, exceptionally cold winters in one place might be balanced by extremely warm winters in another part of the world. Generally, warming is greater over land than over the oceans because water is slower to absorb and release heat (thermal inertia). Warming may also differ substantially within specific land masses and ocean basins.\nIn the animation at the top of the page and in the bar chart below, the years from 1880 to 1939 tend to be cooler, then level off by the 1950s. Decades within the base period (1951-1980) do not appear particularly warm or cold because they are the standard against which other years are measured.\nThe leveling off of temperatures in the middle of the 20th century can be explained by natural variability and by the cooling effects of aerosols generated by factories, power plants, and motor vehicles in the years of rapid economic growth after World War II. Fossil fuel use also increased after the war (5 percent per year), boosting greenhouse gases. Cooling from aerosol pollution happened rapidly. In contrast, greenhouse gases accumulated slowly, but they remain in the atmosphere for a much longer time. According to former GISS director James Hansen, the strong warming trend of the past four decades likely reflects a shift from balanced aerosol and greenhouse gas effects on the atmosphere to a predominance of greenhouse gas effects after aerosols were curbed by pollution controls.\nWhy should we care about one or two degrees of global warming? After all, temperatures fluctuate by many degrees every day where we live.\nThe temperatures we experience locally and in short periods can fluctuate significantly due to predictable, cyclical events (night and day, summer and winter) and hard-to-predict wind and precipitation patterns. But the global temperature mainly depends on how much energy the planet receives from the Sun and how much it radiates back into space. The energy coming from the Sun fluctuates very little by year, while the amount of energy radiated by Earth is closely tied to the chemical composition of the atmosphere\u2014particularly the amount of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.\nA one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all of the oceans, the atmosphere, and the land masses by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age. A five-degree drop was enough to bury a large part of North America under a towering mass of ice 20,000 years ago.\nGlobal temperature records start around 1880 because observations did not sufficiently cover enough of the planet prior to that time. The line plot above shows yearly temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2020 as recorded by NASA, NOAA, the Berkeley Earth research group, the Met Office Hadley Centre (United Kingdom), and the Cowtan and Way analysis. Though there are minor variations from year to year, all five records show peaks and valleys in sync with each other. All show rapid warming in the past few decades, and all show the last decade as the warmest.\nThe NASA GISS team chose the period of 1951-1980 as its baseline largely because the U.S. National Weather Service uses a three-decade period to define \u201cnormal\u201d or average temperature. The GISS temperature analysis effort also began around 1980, so the most recent 30 years was 1951-1980. Their objective is to provide an estimate of temperature change that could be compared with predictions of global climate change in response to atmospheric carbon dioxide, aerosols, and changes in solar activity.\nNASA\u2019s temperature analyses incorporate surface temperature measurements from more than 20,000 weather stations, ship- and buoy-based observations of sea surface temperatures, and temperature measurements from Antarctic research stations. These in situ measurements are analyzed using an algorithm that considers the varied spacing of temperature stations around the globe and urban heat island effects.\nSubscribe to the Earth Observatory and get the Earth in your inbox.\nNASA's Earth Observatory brings you the Earth, every day, with in-depth stories and stunning imagery.\nExplore Earth Science\nEarth Science Data\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Other EPA webpages, including one explaining the \u2018future of climate change,\u2019 still mention the link between humans burning fossil fuels and a changing climate.\nThe \u2018causes of climate change\u2019 page, for example, now reads, \u201cNatural processes are always influencing the earth\u2019s climate and can explain climate changes prior to the Industrial Revolution in the 1700s,\u201d before listing such issues as changes in Earth\u2019s orbit, variations in solar activity and volcanic activity. \u201cHowever, recent climate changes cannot be explained by natural causes alone.\u201d\nPreviously, that webpage contained an entire section on the human causes of climate change and cited the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s statement that \u201cIt is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land.\u201d That section is now missing.\nChanges to the site were made sometime after early October, according to Internet Archive\u2019s webpage archive website Wayback Machine.\nIn addition, the agency\u2019s webpages on \u2018climate change indicators\u2019 are no longer active. This was a popular resource among educators since they detailed how climate change was affecting the United States. Other federal agencies have also made changes to climate-related websites, such as the discontinuation of climate.gov earlier this year.\nThe changes have alarmed climate scientists.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about data on a website; it\u2019s an attack on independent science and scientific integrity,\u201d Rachel Cleetus of the Union of Concerned Scientists said in a statement.\nPhil Duffy, chief scientist at Spark Climate Solutions, called the changed webpages \u201cmisleading,\u201d and took aim at the altered page on the causes of climate change. \u201cThis is like a website on causes of chest pain that mentions indigestion but not heart attack: it leads to the wrong treatment,\u201d he said.\nDaniel Swain, a climate scientist with UC Agriculture and Natural Resources, also told CNN the bigger problem is not the pages that have disappeared, but the ones like \u2018causes of climate change\u2019 that have been modified \u201cso that it is no longer accurate.\u201d\n\u201cThe fact that a government agency would do that on their public facing website and make that choice within the past week or so, according to the timestamps, to change content that was previously correct and make it wrong, according to the overwhelming volume of scientific evidence, is highly concerning,\u201d Swain said.\nIn a statement, an EPA spokesperson said it is no longer focused on protecting \u201cleft-wing political agendas.\u201d\nThe \u201cagency no longer takes marching orders from the climate cult,\u201d an EPA spokesperson said in a statement. The spokesperson said the agency is committed to \u201cuphold gold-standard science at the Trump EPA\u201d and \u201cprevious iterations of the website that do not meet those standards are archived and available to the public.\u201d\nThe webpage changes are coming ahead of a widely anticipated EPA rule change that, if successful, would effectively take away the federal government\u2019s main way to fight climate change.\nThe 2009 landmark scientific finding, known as the \u201cendangerment finding,\u201d determined planet-warming pollution from fossil fuels endangers human health. Since the Obama administration, it has served as the basis for federal rules limiting greenhouse gas pollution from power plants, cars and trucks and the oil and gas industry.\nThe EPA unveiled its proposal to repeal the rule in July and is widely expected to finalize the decision early next year. The agency\u2019s proposal also sought to repeal rules that regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, since they stemmed from the finding.\nThe webpage changes are part of a larger picture of the Trump administration\u2019s aggressively pro-fossil fuels stance, said former Biden administration EPA official Joe Goffman.\n\u201cNo matter how seemingly discreet the actions being taken across the executive branch, it\u2019s still the same project,\u201d Goffman said, adding that the EPA has traditionally been a public source of current, user-friendly scientific information on climate change and its link to humans burning fossil fuels.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got to wipe that out, and that\u2019s what they\u2019ve done by changing the website, removing any reference to human activity,\u201d Goffman said.\nIt\u2019s not the first time the Trump administration has downplayed climate change. The Trump administration also removed past National Climate Assessments from government sites.\nAnd last summer, the Energy Department released a report written by a small group of longtime climate contrarians, which minimized humans\u2019 role in global warming as well as its severity. Mainstream climate scientists heavily criticized the report for cherry-picking evidence and misinterpreting key climate science findings. The group dissolved after it was sued by environmental organizations.\nThough the DOE report was first issued in conjunction with the EPA\u2019s proposal to repeal the endangerment finding, it may ultimately not be relied on for the final product, Goffman said.\n\u201cTheir first effort through DOE report was to try to justify why they were doing this, claiming that climate science didn\u2019t support the conclusion that human activity was causing climate change,\u201d Goffman said. \u201cBut, by issuing that report, I think they actually ended up in a worse position vis a vis the public.\u201d\n\u00a9 2025 Cable News Network.

While natural variability plays some part, the preponderance of evidence indicates that human activities\u2014particularly emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases\u2014are mostly responsible for making our planet warmer.\nAccording to an ongoing temperature analysis led by scientists at NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), the average global temperature on Earth has increased by at least 1.1\u00b0 Celsius (1.9\u00b0 Fahrenheit) since 1880. The majority of the warming has occurred since 1975, at a rate of roughly 0.15 to 0.20\u00b0C per decade.\nThe maps above show temperature anomalies in five-year increments since 1880. (Click on the arrow to run the animation.) These are not absolute temperatures, but changes from the norm for each area. The data reflect how much warmer or cooler each region was compared to a base period of 1951-1980. (The global mean surface air temperature for that period was 14\u00b0C (57\u00b0F), with an uncertainty of several tenths of a degree.)\nThe image below shows global temperature anomalies in 2022, which tied for the fifth warmest year on record. The past nine years have been the warmest years since modern recordkeeping began in 1880.\nAs the maps show, global warming does not mean temperatures rise everywhere at every time by same rate. Temperatures might rise 5 degrees in one region and drop 2 degrees in another. For instance, exceptionally cold winters in one place might be balanced by extremely warm winters in another part of the world. Generally, warming is greater over land than over the oceans because water is slower to absorb and release heat (thermal inertia). Warming may also differ substantially within specific land masses and ocean basins.\nIn the animation at the top of the page and in the bar chart below, the years from 1880 to 1939 tend to be cooler, then level off by the 1950s. Decades within the base period (1951-1980) do not appear particularly warm or cold because they are the standard against which other years are measured.\nThe leveling off of temperatures in the middle of the 20th century can be explained by natural variability and by the cooling effects of aerosols generated by factories, power plants, and motor vehicles in the years of rapid economic growth after World War II. Fossil fuel use also increased after the war (5 percent per year), boosting greenhouse gases. Cooling from aerosol pollution happened rapidly. In contrast, greenhouse gases accumulated slowly, but they remain in the atmosphere for a much longer time. According to former GISS director James Hansen, the strong warming trend of the past four decades likely reflects a shift from balanced aerosol and greenhouse gas effects on the atmosphere to a predominance of greenhouse gas effects after aerosols were curbed by pollution controls.\nWhy should we care about one or two degrees of global warming? After all, temperatures fluctuate by many degrees every day where we live.\nThe temperatures we experience locally and in short periods can fluctuate significantly due to predictable, cyclical events (night and day, summer and winter) and hard-to-predict wind and precipitation patterns. But the global temperature mainly depends on how much energy the planet receives from the Sun and how much it radiates back into space. The energy coming from the Sun fluctuates very little by year, while the amount of energy radiated by Earth is closely tied to the chemical composition of the atmosphere\u2014particularly the amount of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.\nA one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all of the oceans, the atmosphere, and the land masses by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age. A five-degree drop was enough to bury a large part of North America under a towering mass of ice 20,000 years ago.\nGlobal temperature records start around 1880 because observations did not sufficiently cover enough of the planet prior to that time. The line plot above shows yearly temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2020 as recorded by NASA, NOAA, the Berkeley Earth research group, the Met Office Hadley Centre (United Kingdom), and the Cowtan and Way analysis. Though there are minor variations from year to year, all five records show peaks and valleys in sync with each other. All show rapid warming in the past few decades, and all show the last decade as the warmest.\nThe NASA GISS team chose the period of 1951-1980 as its baseline largely because the U.S. National Weather Service uses a three-decade period to define \u201cnormal\u201d or average temperature. The GISS temperature analysis effort also began around 1980, so the most recent 30 years was 1951-1980. Their objective is to provide an estimate of temperature change that could be compared with predictions of global climate change in response to atmospheric carbon dioxide, aerosols, and changes in solar activity.\nNASA\u2019s temperature analyses incorporate surface temperature measurements from more than 20,000 weather stations, ship- and buoy-based observations of sea surface temperatures, and temperature measurements from Antarctic research stations.

Fossil fuel use also increased after the war (5 percent per year), boosting greenhouse gases. Cooling from aerosol pollution happened rapidly. In contrast, greenhouse gases accumulated slowly, but they remain in the atmosphere for a much longer time. According to former GISS director James Hansen, the strong warming trend of the past four decades likely reflects a shift from balanced aerosol and greenhouse gas effects on the atmosphere to a predominance of greenhouse gas effects after aerosols were curbed by pollution controls.\nWhy should we care about one or two degrees of global warming? After all, temperatures fluctuate by many degrees every day where we live.\nThe temperatures we experience locally and in short periods can fluctuate significantly due to predictable, cyclical events (night and day, summer and winter) and hard-to-predict wind and precipitation patterns. But the global temperature mainly depends on how much energy the planet receives from the Sun and how much it radiates back into space. The energy coming from the Sun fluctuates very little by year, while the amount of energy radiated by Earth is closely tied to the chemical composition of the atmosphere\u2014particularly the amount of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.\nA one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all of the oceans, the atmosphere, and the land masses by that much.

Now, the EPA\u2019s webpage detailing the \u2018causes of climate change\u2019 no longer lists human activities such as burning oil, gas and coal \u2014 the key drivers of a warming climate since the industrial revolution.\nIn some cases, the agency has left information that implies the existence of human-caused climate change, while removing direct references to that fact. Other EPA webpages, including one explaining the \u2018future of climate change,\u2019 still mention the link between humans burning fossil fuels and a changing climate.\nThe \u2018causes of climate change\u2019 page, for example, now reads, \u201cNatural processes are always influencing the earth\u2019s climate and can explain climate changes prior to the Industrial Revolution in the 1700s,\u201d before listing such issues as changes in Earth\u2019s orbit, variations in solar activity and volcanic activity. \u201cHowever, recent climate changes cannot be explained by natural causes alone.\u201d\nPreviously, that webpage contained an entire section on the human causes of climate change and cited the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s statement that \u201cIt is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land.\u201d That section is now missing.\nChanges to the site were made sometime after early October, according to Internet Archive\u2019s webpage archive website Wayback Machine.\nIn addition, the agency\u2019s webpages on \u2018climate change indicators\u2019 are no longer active. This was a popular resource among educators since they detailed how climate change was affecting the United States. Other federal agencies have also made changes to climate-related websites, such as the discontinuation of climate.gov earlier this year.\nThe changes have alarmed climate scientists.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about data on a website; it\u2019s an attack on independent science and scientific integrity,\u201d Rachel Cleetus of the Union of Concerned Scientists said in a statement.\nPhil Duffy, chief scientist at Spark Climate Solutions, called the changed webpages \u201cmisleading,\u201d and took aim at the altered page on the causes of climate change. \u201cThis is like a website on causes of chest pain that mentions indigestion but not heart attack: it leads to the wrong treatment,\u201d he said.\nDaniel Swain, a climate scientist with UC Agriculture and Natural Resources, also told CNN the bigger problem is not the pages that have disappeared, but the ones like \u2018causes of climate change\u2019 that have been modified \u201cso that it is no longer accurate.\u201d\n\u201cThe fact that a government agency would do that on their public facing website and make that choice within the past week or so, according to the timestamps, to change content that was previously correct and make it wrong, according to the overwhelming volume of scientific evidence, is highly concerning,\u201d Swain said.\nIn a statement, an EPA spokesperson said it is no longer focused on protecting \u201cleft-wing political agendas.\u201d\nThe \u201cagency no longer takes marching orders from the climate cult,\u201d an EPA spokesperson said in a statement. The spokesperson said the agency is committed to \u201cuphold gold-standard science at the Trump EPA\u201d and \u201cprevious iterations of the website that do not meet those standards are archived and available to the public.\u201d\nThe webpage changes are coming ahead of a widely anticipated EPA rule change that, if successful, would effectively take away the federal government\u2019s main way to fight climate change.\nThe 2009 landmark scientific finding, known as the \u201cendangerment finding,\u201d determined planet-warming pollution from fossil fuels endangers human health. Since the Obama administration, it has served as the basis for federal rules limiting greenhouse gas pollution from power plants, cars and trucks and the oil and gas industry.\nThe EPA unveiled its proposal to repeal the rule in July and is widely expected to finalize the decision early next year. The agency\u2019s proposal also sought to repeal rules that regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, since they stemmed from the finding.\nThe webpage changes are part of a larger picture of the Trump administration\u2019s aggressively pro-fossil fuels stance, said former Biden administration EPA official Joe Goffman.\n\u201cNo matter how seemingly discreet the actions being taken across the executive branch, it\u2019s still the same project,\u201d Goffman said, adding that the EPA has traditionally been a public source of current, user-friendly scientific information on climate change and its link to humans burning fossil fuels.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got to wipe that out, and that\u2019s what they\u2019ve done by changing the website, removing any reference to human activity,\u201d Goffman said.\nIt\u2019s not the first time the Trump administration has downplayed climate change. The Trump administration also removed past National Climate Assessments from government sites.\nAnd last summer, the Energy Department released a report written by a small group of longtime climate contrarians, which minimized humans\u2019 role in global warming as well as its severity. Mainstream climate scientists heavily criticized the report for cherry-picking evidence and misinterpreting key climate science findings. The group dissolved after it was sued by environmental organizations.\nThough the DOE report was first issued in conjunction with the EPA\u2019s proposal to repeal the endangerment finding, it may ultimately not be relied on for the final product, Goffman said.\n\u201cTheir first effort through DOE report was to try to justify why they were doing this, claiming that climate science didn\u2019t support the conclusion that human activity was causing climate change,\u201d Goffman said. \u201cBut, by issuing that report, I think they actually ended up in a worse position vis a vis the public.\u201d\n\u00a9 2025 Cable News Network.

All are incomplete representations of nature, with uncertainty built into them. But one thing is certain: Several fundamental projections found in U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports have consistently underestimated real-world observations, potentially leaving world governments in doubt as to how to guide climate policy.\nAt the heart of all IPCC projections are \u201cemission scenarios:\u201d low-, mid-, and high-range estimates for future carbon emissions. From these \u201cwhat if\u201d estimates flow projections for temperature, sea-rise, and more.\nProjection: In 2001, the IPCC offered a range of fossil fuel and industrial emissions trends, from a best-case scenario of 7.7 billion tons of carbon released each year by 2010 to a worst-case scenario of 9.7 billion tons.\nGraphic of emissions scenarios. The IPCC failed to anticipate China's economic growth, or the intense resistance by the United States and other nations to curbing greenhouse gases. Credit: U.S. Global Change Research Program.\nReality: In 2010, global emissions from fossil fuels alone totaled 9.1 billion tons of carbon, according to federal government's Earth Systems Research Laboratory.\nWhy the miss? While technically within the range, scientists never expected emissions to rise so high so quickly, said IPCC scientist Christopher Field. The IPCC, for instance, failed to anticipate China's economic growth, or resistance by the United States and other nations to curbing greenhouse gases.\n\u201cWe really haven't explored a world in which the emissions growth rate is as rapid as we have actually seen happen,\u201d Fields said.\nIPCC models use the emission scenarios discussed above to estimate average global temperature increases by the year 2100.\nProjection: The IPCC's 2007 assessment projected a worst-case temperature rise of 4.3\u00b0 to 11.5\u00b0F, with a high probability of 7.2\u00b0F.\nIPCC emission scenarios underestimated global CO2 emission rates, which means temperature rates were underestimated too. Photo of a climate activist warning of 6\u00baC warming. Credit: \u00a9 Adela Nistora\nReality: We are currently on track for a rise of between 6.3\u00b0 and 13.3\u00b0F, with a high probability of an increase of 9.4\u00b0F by 2100, according to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Other modelers are getting similar results, including a study published earlier this month by the Global Carbon Project consortium confirming the likelihood of a 9\u00b0F rise.\nWhy the miss? IPCC emission scenarios underestimated global CO2 emission rates, which means temperature rates were underestimated too. And it could get worse: IPCC projections haven\u2019t included likely feedbacks such as large-scale melting of Arctic permafrost and subsequent release of large quantities of CO2 and methane, a greenhouse gas 20 times more potent, albeit shorter lived, in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide.\nFive years ago, the summer retreat of Arctic sea ice wildly outdistanced all 18 IPCC computer models, amazing IPCC scientists. It did so again in 2012.\nProjection: The IPCC has always confidently projected that the Arctic sea ice pack was safe at least until 2050 or well beyond 2100.\nGraphic showing Arctic summer ice projections vs. observations. For scientists, it is increasingly clear that the models are under-predicting the rate of sea ice retreat because they are missing key real-world interactions. Credit: Vancouver Observer\nReality: Summer sea ice is thinning faster than every climate projection, and today scientists predict a largely ice-free Arctic Ocean in years, not decades. Last summer, Arctic sea ice extent plummeted to 1.32 million square miles, the lowest level ever recorded \u2013 50 percent below the long-term 1979 to 2000 average.\nWhy the miss? For scientists, it is increasingly clear that the models are under-predicting the rate of sea ice retreat because they are missing key real-world interactions.\n\u201cSea ice modelers have speculated that the 2007 minimum was an aberration\u2026 a matter of random variability, noise in the system, that sea ice would recover.\u2026 That no longer looks tenable,\u201d says Penn State scientist and IPCC contributor Michael Mann. \u201cIt is a stunning reminder that uncertainty doesn't always act in our favor.\u201d\nGreenland and Antarctica are melting, even though IPCC said in 1995 that they wouldn\u2019t be.\nProjection: In 1995, IPCC projected \u201clittle change in the extent of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets\u2026 over the next 50-100 years.\u201d In 2007 IPCC embraced a drastic revision: \u201cNew data\u2026 show[s] that losses from the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica have very likely contributed to sea level rise over 1993 to 2003.\u201d\nReality: Today, ice loss in Greenland and Antarctica is trending at least 100 years ahead of projections compared to IPCC's first three reports.\nWhy the miss? \u201cAfter 2001, we began to realize there were complex dynamics at work \u2013 ice cracks, lubrication and sliding of ice sheets,\u201d that were melting ice sheets quicker, said Kevin Trenberth, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. New feedbacks unknown to past IPCC authors have also been found. A 2012 study, for example, showed that the reflectivity of Greenland's ice sheet is decreasing, causing ice to absorb more heat, likely escalating melting.\nThe fate of the world's coastlines has become a classic example of how the IPCC, when confronted with conflicting science, tends to go silent.\nProjection: In the 2001 report, the IPCC projected a sea rise of 2 millimeters per year. The worst-case scenario in the 2007 report, which looked mostly at thermal expansion of the oceans as temperatures warmed, called for up to 1.9 feet of sea-level-rise by century's end.\nA \u201cking tide\u201d leaves parts of Sausalito, Calif., flooded in 2010.

However, without major reductions in these emissions, the increase in annual average global temperatures relative to preindustrial times could reach 5\u00b0C or more by the end of this century.\nThe global climate continues to change rapidly compared to the pace of natural climate variations throughout Earth\u2019s history. Trends in globally averaged temperature, sea level rise, upper-ocean heat content, land-based ice melt, arctic sea ice, depth of seasonal permafrost thaw, and other climate variables provide consistent evidence of a warming planet.\nThese observed trends are robust and confirmed by multiple independent research groups worldwide.

Temperatures for years cooler than the baseline are shown in purple.\nGraphic: Climate Central; Data: NASA GISS and and NOAA NCEI. Global temperature.\nObservations of the climate system are based on direct physical and biogeochemical measurements, and remote sensing from ground stations and satellites. Information derived from paleoclimate archives provides a long-term context of past climates.\nDifferent types of environmental evidence are used to understand what the Earth\u2019s past climate was like and why. Records of historical climate conditions are preserved in tree rings, locked in the skeletons of tropical coral reefs, sealed in glaciers and ice caps, and buried in laminated sediments from lakes and the ocean.\nScientists can use those environmental recorders to estimate past conditions, extending our understanding of climate back hundreds to millions of years.\nGlobal-scale observations from the instrumental era began in the mid-19th century, and paleoclimate reconstructions extend the record of some quantities back hundreds to millions of years. Together, this provides a comprehensive view of the variability and long-term changes in the atmosphere, the ocean, the cryosphere and at the land surface.\nThe Earth\u2019s climate is changing, and it is projected to continue changing over the next century.\nThe magnitude of climate change beyond the next few decades will depend primarily on the amount of greenhouse (heat-trapping) gases emitted globally and on the remaining uncertainty about the Earth\u2019s climate's sensitivity to those emissions.\nWith significant reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the global annual average temperature rise could be limited to 2\u00b0C or less.

The thick red line depicts the multi-model mean while the thin red lines show the multi-model 90% range. The overlap of reconstructed temperatures is shown by grey shading.\nIn Figure 3, model projections indicate that twenty-first-century global average warming will substantially exceed the Last Glacial Maximum period and even the warmest Holocene conditions, producing a climate state not previously experienced.\nFIGURE 3\nThe period from 1983 to 2012 was likely the warmest 30-year period of the last 800 years and likely the warmest 30-year period of the previous 1400 years.\nModel-simulated global temperature anomalies for the Last Glacial Maximum (21,000 years ago), the mid-Holocene (6,000 years ago), and projection for 2071\u20132095, under RCP8.5.\nEarth\u2019s climate is now changing faster than at any point in the known history of the climate, primarily as a result of human activities.\nThere is scientific consensus that unmitigated carbon emissions will lead to global warming of at least several degrees Celsius by 2100, resulting in high-impacts of local, regional and global risks to human society and natural ecosystems.

Black and Hispanic Americans are exposed to 56 and 63 percent more particulate matter pollution, respectively, than they produce. In a predominantly Black and low-income area of Louisiana known as \u201cCancer Alley,\u201d the cancer risk is nearly 50 times higher than the national average due to 150 nearby chemical plants and oil refineries.\nSeveral policy mechanisms have been proposed to reduce fossil fuel externalities, including:\nAuthor: Savannah Bertrand\nEditor: Anna McGinn\nGraphic: Emma Johnson\nFor the endnotes, please download the PDF version of this issue brief.\nEESI RSS Feed\n1020 19th Street, NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20036-6101\n(202) 628-1400 phone (202) 204-5244 fax\ninfo@eesi.org Staff directory EIN: 52-1268030\nEESI advances science-based solutions for climate change, energy, and environmental challenges in order to achieve our vision of a sustainable, resilient, and equitable world.\nMore about EESI\nCopyright \u00a9 Environmental and Energy Study Institute (EESI).
