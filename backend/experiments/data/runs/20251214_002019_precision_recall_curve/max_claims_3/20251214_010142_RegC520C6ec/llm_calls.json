occurring every day around the planet are blamed on mother nature but nothing could be further from the [Music] truth all that is required to understand explain and demonstrate how Decades of global geoengineering development is directly and deliberately responsible for all of the Super Storms hurricanes tornadoes and floods is the understanding of a few simple [Music] Concepts however to find un altered explanations of these Concepts we must first travel back 60 years [Music] rain rain go away come again some other day two young fellas want to play one is Fred he lives in this Farm the other is Pete he lives in the city he's visiting [Music] friend boy where does all this rain come from from the sky everybody knows that [Music] but what Pete really wants to know is how does the water get into the sky well let's see Fred sees one way as the water dries off the horses it goes into the air but there are lots of other ways when the sun comes out strongly after a shower we can almost see the water disappearing into the air [Music] here heat from the Sun is drying the roof water at the top edge of the puddle slowly disappears into the air right before our eyes billions of gallons of water go into the air every hour from the ponds lakes rivers and oceans all over the world in fact everything that dries as giving water to the air even wet Fields do [Music] this and wet clothes on a line slowly lose water to the air and become [Music] dry whether you can see it or whether you can't water is always going into the air from many things even dogs give water to the air as they pant [Music] people as well as animals have to replace the water their bodies give off to the [Music] air yep there's another way water can get into the air the water on the doghouse roof dried pretty fast in the warm sun this this water disappears faster because the stove is hotter this change from water we can see to water vapor we can't see is called [Music] evaporation no that's not evaporation that water isn't changing to water vapor it's just sinking into the soil evaporation comes later the leaves give off water to the air water taken up of the plant's Roots it's hard to believe so let's find out if it's true first a cardboard disc to cover the wet soil then a jar to keep any water vapor from the leaves from being lost to the air and the jar without a [Music] plan and last time until tomorrow [Music] morning during the night the plant gave off water because the jar without the plant is dry inside the jar are droplets just like the droplets that form in the moisture from Fred's warm breath hits the window glass the water vapor changes into very small drops of water because the window is cold in the same way the water vapor from the plant changed to water when it touched the cooler surface of the jar but what happens if the glass is warm the best way to answer such a question is to try [Music] it first a glass is [Music] warm then another glass is chilled [Music] what happens with the warm glass nothing but soon on the cold glass glass water collects water from the air when this happens it's called condensation condensation causes dew on the grass during the night when the earth and grass is cooler than the air condensation takes place and the water vapor forms little drops of water the cloud from the spot of the teac kettle is condensation of the water vapor from the teac kettle hitting the colder air the water vapor in the warm air of the room forms a cloud as it hits the very cold air from the refrigerator [Music] uh-oh now what's going to happen [Music] condensation rain [Music] the hot water in the kettle gives off water vapor to the air by rapid evaporation just as rivers lakes and ponds give off water vapor to the air by slow evaporation as the hot water-filled air hits the colder air near the ice tray the water vapor turns into clouds of tiny water droplets floating in the air condensation when the air is quite cold and cannot hold any more water droplets they collect together to form larger drops as on the ice tray and being too heavy to float in the air they fall back to the Earth as [Music] rain without water in the air we couldn't live our Fields would be dry and nothing would grow because water evaporates in the air and returns again as rain we have water running through the valleys in our Brooks and streams filling reservoirs with water to drink turning our water wheels and turning the turbines and the powerhouses to give us electricity all from water in the air the fundamentals of global geoengineering are no different than this child's experiment water vapor is artificially introduced into the air in place of the natural evaporation stage and is artificially cooled and condensed to produce [Music] rain you need a great many tea kettal to produce the massive amounts of water vapor required to fuel these Global storm systems and this planet is deliberately covered with them [Music] [Music] this

The purpose of solar geoengineering is to cool the Earth by reflecting more sunlight back to space. Depending on the approach ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nGeoengineering methods are intended to reduce climate change, which is already having demonstrable effects on ecosystem structure and functioning in some regions. Two types of geoengineering activities that have been proposed are: carbon dioxide (CO2) removal (CDR), which removes CO2 from the atmosphere, and solar radiation management (SRM, or sunlight reflection methods), which reflects a small percentage of sunlight back into space to offset warming from greenhouse gases (GHGs). Current research suggests that SRM or CDR might diminish the impacts of climate change on ecosystems by reducing changes in temperature and precipitation. However, sudden cessation of SRM would exacerbate the climate effects on ecosystems, and some CDR might interfere with oceanic and terrestrial ecosystem processes. The many risks and uncertainties associated with these new kinds of purposeful perturbations to the Earth system are not well understood and require cautious and comprehensive research.\nKeywords: Geoengineering, Ecosystems, Climate change, Carbon dioxide removal, Solar radiation management\nAs anthropogenic emissions of GHG rise and their concentrations in the atmosphere continue to increase, there is growing discussion about the need to evaluate \u201cgeoengineering\u201d methods to reduce the greenhouse effects on the climate and environment (Shepherd et al. 2009). Geoengineering can be defined as the deliberate manipulation of features of the Earth system to reduce the magnitude and rate of changes in the physical climate system that are attributed to this accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs; IPCC 2007a). While there has now been much general discussion of the different means by which geoengineering may be accomplished and some speculation about the research strategies by which their effectiveness could be determined (Shepherd et al. 2009), there has been relatively little discussion of research needed to understand their potential for affecting ecosystems. Yet many geoengineering activities could significantly impact both natural and managed ecosystems and their functions. This is important because ecosystems, including those within forests, oceans, grasslands, and wetlands, provide both innate value and our life support systems, including numerous essential goods and services (MEA 2005). This study focuses on research needs related to identifying and quantifying potential ecosystem consequences of proposed geoengineering methods. Ecosystem impacts form a subset of a much broader range of pertinent social and physical science research questions, including issues of governance and ethics, all of which should be addressed before any proposed geoengineering method could be considered as a viable policy option.\nIn this report, we follow the Royal Society (Shepherd et al. 2009) in referring to two different sets of activities: carbon dioxide removal (CDR) methods, including a range of engineered and biological processes to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, and solar radiation management (SRM or sunlight reflection) methods, typically involving reflecting a small percentage of solar light and heat back into space to offset the warming due to GHGs. CDR and SRM techniques are fundamentally different in the timescales over which the interventions would operate (Lenton and Vaughan 2009; Shepherd et al. 2009). The scale-up of a CDR deployment to the point where it would have significant climate effects would be slow (likely decades for a substantial drawdown of CO2), but with long lasting effects. In contrast, SRM could provide rapid cooling (in months) but would require continual renewal. Of these two types of methods, only CDR would address the CO2 concentrations responsible for both climate change as well as other CO2-induced ecosystem effects such as ocean acidification.\nThe Earth\u2019s temperature and climate are fundamentally controlled by its energy balance, which drives and maintains the climate system. This balance consists of incoming energy from the Sun (including ultra violet, visible, and infrared) and outgoing heat (thermal infrared) radiation. These energy streams do not reach or leave Earth\u2019s surface unimpeded. On average, about one third of the incoming sunlight radiation is reflected by clouds and aerosols, ice caps, and bright surfaces. This fraction that is reflected is referred to as its \u201calbedo\u201d. Most incoming energy passes through the atmosphere to reach Earth\u2019s surface; the part not reflected by the albedo is absorbed and so warms the surface. The absorbed energy is transferred to the atmosphere by emitted surface radiation, evaporative cooling, and direct thermal motion. Some outgoing thermal energy then emitted by Earth\u2019s surface is absorbed by GHGs in the atmosphere (mainly by water vapor and CO2) and also by clouds, thus reducing the amount of heat radiation escaping to space and warming the atmosphere and Earth\u2019s surface. This is known as the greenhouse effect. On average, only about 60% of the radiation emitted at the surface leaves the atmosphere, after absorption and emission within the atmosphere. Increased atmospheric CO2 is not only responsible for temperature changes, but for other consequences to the Earth system. In addition, increased CO2 absorbed by the ocean has a measurable effect on ocean acidity, with consequent impacts on ocean biogeochemistry and biodiversity.\nCDR methods are designed to remove CO2 from the atmosphere and transfer it to long-lived carbon reservoirs. They include:\nLand use management to protect or enhance terrestrial carbon sinks;\nUsing biomass for carbon sequestration as well as (or instead of) a carbon neutral energy source;\nAccelerating natural geological processes that remove CO2 from the atmosphere (e.g., \u201cenhanced weathering\u201d);\nDirect engineered capture of CO2 from ambient air (i.e., collection and removal of CO2 from the atmosphere to storage reservoirs that are isolated from the atm\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Two types of geoengineering activities that have been proposed are: carbon dioxide (CO2) removal (CDR), which removes CO2 from the atmosphere, and solar radiation management (SRM, or sunlight reflection methods), which reflects a small percentage of sunlight back into space to offset warming from greenhouse gases (GHGs). Current research suggests that SRM or CDR might diminish the impacts of climate change on ecosystems by reducing changes in temperature and precipitation. However, sudden cessation of SRM would exacerbate the climate effects on ecosystems, and some CDR might interfere with oceanic and terrestrial ecosystem processes. The many risks and uncertainties associated with these new kinds of purposeful perturbations to the Earth system are not well understood and require cautious and comprehensive research.\nKeywords: Geoengineering, Ecosystems, Climate change, Carbon dioxide removal, Solar radiation management\nAs anthropogenic emissions of GHG rise and their concentrations in the atmosphere continue to increase, there is growing discussion about the need to evaluate \u201cgeoengineering\u201d methods to reduce the greenhouse effects on the climate and environment (Shepherd et al. 2009). Geoengineering can be defined as the deliberate manipulation of features of the Earth system to reduce the magnitude and rate of changes in the physical climate system that are attributed to this accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs; IPCC 2007a). While there has now been much general discussion of the different means by which geoengineering may be accomplished and some speculation about the research strategies by which their effectiveness could be determined (Shepherd et al. 2009), there has been relatively little discussion of research needed to understand their potential for affecting ecosystems. Yet many geoengineering activities could significantly impact both natural and managed ecosystems and their functions. This is important because ecosystems, including those within forests, oceans, grasslands, and wetlands, provide both innate value and our life support systems, including numerous essential goods and services (MEA 2005). This study focuses on research needs related to identifying and quantifying potential ecosystem consequences of proposed geoengineering methods. Ecosystem impacts form a subset of a much broader range of pertinent social and physical science research questions, including issues of governance and ethics, all of which should be addressed before any proposed geoengineering method could be considered as a viable policy option.\nIn this report, we follow the Royal Society (Shepherd et al. 2009) in referring to two different sets of activities: carbon dioxide removal (CDR) methods, including a range of engineered and biological processes to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, and solar radiation management (SRM or sunlight reflection) methods, typically involving reflecting a small percentage of solar light and heat back into space to offset the warming due to GHGs. CDR and SRM techniques are fundamentally different in the timescales over which the interventions would operate (Lenton and Vaughan 2009; Shepherd et al. 2009). The scale-up of a CDR deployment to the point where it would have significant climate effects would be slow (likely decades for a substantial drawdown of CO2), but with long lasting effects. In contrast, SRM could provide rapid cooling (in months) but would require continual renewal. Of these two types of methods, only CDR would address the CO2 concentrations responsible for both climate change as well as other CO2-induced ecosystem effects such as ocean acidification.\nThe Earth\u2019s temperature and climate are fundamentally controlled by its energy balance, which drives and maintains the climate system. This balance consists of incoming energy from the Sun (including ultra violet, visible, and infrared) and outgoing heat (thermal infrared) radiation. These energy streams do not reach or leave Earth\u2019s surface unimpeded. On average, about one third of the incoming sunlight radiation is reflected by clouds and aerosols, ice caps, and bright surfaces. This fraction that is reflected is referred to as its \u201calbedo\u201d. Most incoming energy passes through the atmosphere to reach Earth\u2019s surface; the part not reflected by the albedo is absorbed and so warms the surface. The absorbed energy is transferred to the atmosphere by emitted surface radiation, evaporative cooling, and direct thermal motion. Some outgoing thermal energy then emitted by Earth\u2019s surface is absorbed by GHGs in the atmosphere (mainly by water vapor and CO2) and also by clouds, thus reducing the amount of heat radiation escaping to space and warming the atmosphere and Earth\u2019s surface. This is known as the greenhouse effect. On average, only about 60% of the radiation emitted at the surface leaves the atmosphere, after absorption and emission within the atmosphere. Increased atmospheric CO2 is not only responsible for temperature changes, but for other consequences to the Earth system. In addition, increased CO2 absorbed by the ocean has a measurable effect on ocean acidity, with consequent impacts on ocean biogeochemistry and biodiversity.\nCDR methods are designed to remove CO2 from the atmosphere and transfer it to long-lived carbon reservoirs. They include:\nLand use management to protect or enhance terrestrial carbon sinks;\nUsing biomass for carbon sequestration as well as (or instead of) a carbon neutral energy source;\nAccelerating natural geological processes that remove CO2 from the atmosphere (e.g., \u201cenhanced weathering\u201d);\nDirect engineered capture of CO2 from ambient air (i.e., collection and removal of CO2 from the atmosphere to storage reservoirs that are isolated from the atm\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Introduction Increasing population, urbanization, and the impacts of a changing climate require that water resources be managed to most effectively alleviate the shortages that manifest themselves, from time to time, in various geographic settings. At the other extreme, precipitation processes on occasion may be so intense and prolonged that damage results to crops and structures, and there can be injuries and loss of life. In addition, nonprecipitating clouds may obscure visibility to the extent that transportation and other human activities are significantly hindered. One tool available for mitigating some of these weather impacts is planned weather modification through cloud seeding. In its most common form, specially formulated aerosols or very cold materials are dispersed in targeted locations within clouds to achieve precipitation enhancement, hail damage mitigation, fog clearing, and other intentional effects. Cloud seeding techniques have been developed over nearly 70 years through experimentation and trials. In this statement we focus on the policy issues that pertain to local-scale application of these techniques covering areas from a few to several hundreds of square kilometers. Larger-scale efforts to intentionally modify weather and climate using these or other techniques are discussed in a separate AMS policy statement on geoengineering.\n2. Uncertainty\nPlanned weather modification programs benefit from a comprehensive understanding of the physical processes responsible for desired modification effects. Recent improvements in the composition and techniques for dispersion of seeding agents, observational technology, numerical cloud models, and in physical understanding of cloud processes permit ever more detailed design and targeting of planned weather modification effects, and more accurate specification of the range of anticipated responses. While effects are often immediately evident in simple situations, such as when cloud seeding is used to clear supercooled fog and low stratus cloud decks, in more complex cloud systems it is often difficult to determine a seeding effect on a cloud-by-cloud basis. In these more complex situations large numbers of events must be analyzed to separate the response to cloud seeding from natural variability in cloud behavior. Rigorous attention to evaluation of both operational and research programs is needed to help develop more effective procedures and to improve understanding of the effects of cloud seeding. Research and operational programs should be designed in a way that will allow their physical and statistical evaluation. Any statistical assessment must be accompanied by physical evaluation to confirm that the statistical results can be attributed to the seeding through a well-understood chain of physical events. It should be noted, though, that in practice large potential benefits can warrant relatively small investments to conduct operational cloud seeding despite some uncertainty in the outcome.\n3. Risk Management\nUnintended consequences of cloud seeding, such as changes in precipitation or other environmental impacts downwind of a target area have not been clearly demonstrated, but neither can they be ruled out. In addition, cloud seeding materials may not be always successfully targeted and may cause their intended effects in an area different than the desired target area. This brings us to the ethical concern that activities conducted for the benefit of some may have an undesirable impact on others. At times unintended effects may cross political boundaries. Weather modification programs should be designed to minimize negative impacts. International cooperation may be needed in some regions.\nPrecipitation augmentation through cloud seeding should be viewed cautiously as a drought relief measure. Opportunities to increase precipitation are reduced during droughts. A program of precipitation augmentation is more effective in cushioning the impact of drought if it is used as part of a water management strategy on a long-term basis, with continuity from year to year, whenever opportunities exist to build soil moisture, to improve cropland, and to increase water in storage.\nFrom time to time methods have been proposed for modifying extreme weather phenomena, such as seeding severe thunderstorms with aerosols to diminish tornado intensity, or seeding tropical cyclones to cause changes in their dynamics and steer them away from land and/or diminish their intensity.

Application of weather modification methods that are not supported by statistically positive results combined with a well-understood physical chain of processes leading to these results, and that can also be replicated by numerical cloud modeling, should be discouraged.\n4.

One idea is to inject sulfur dioxide or sulfuric acid into the stratosphere, where sulfate aerosols are then formed. Such experiments can probably be observed, for example, with satellite occultation instruments like SAGE III/ISS. The aim of the current study is to analyse, using MAECHAM-HAM simulations and retrievals with the radiative transfer program SCIATRAN, whether it is possible to detect the formed stratospheric aerosols from emissions of 1 and 2 Tg S yr\u22121 (sulfur per year) with the currently active satellite occultation instruments, taking into account an error estimate that is as realistic as possible. If these smaller amounts of sulfur are detectable, larger amounts will also be detectable. The calculations show that, considering the natural variability and the assumptions made here, the stratospheric aerosols formed from emissions of 1 and 2 Tg S yr\u22121 in the quasi-steady-state phase can be detected, which is not the case in the first month of the 2-year initial phase.\nGeoengineering, also known as climate engineering, comprises methods and technologies that aim to deliberately change the climate system in order to mitigate the consequences of climate change (IPCC, 2013). One method is solar radiation management (SRM), which aims at modifying the shortwave radiation budget in the climate system by increasing the planetary albedo (IPCC, 2013). The injection of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere (stratospheric aerosol injection, SAI) is one idea of SRM (e.g. Budyko, 1977; Crutzen, 2006), mimicking the effects of large volcanic eruptions where extensive amounts of sulfur dioxide reach the stratosphere. The corresponding radiative forcing of the formed sulfate aerosols depends on the injected amount of sulfur dioxide. Another idea is the injection of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) into the stratosphere (e.g. Vattioni et al., 2019; Janssens et al., 2020; Weisenstein et al., 2022) or carbonyl sulfide (COS) (e.g. Quaglia et al., 2022).\nNote that the exact values of the resulting radiative forcing for the same injection rate may vary depending on the model and set up used (e.g. Niemeier and Tilmes, 2017; Laakso et al., 2022). Simulations with MAECHAM-HAM show that a continuous injection of 10 Tg S yr\u22121 at an altitude of 60 hPa leads to a top of the atmosphere radiative forcing of \u2212(1.79\u20132.06) W m\u22122 (Niemeier and Timmreck, 2015). However, it was shown that the forcing efficiency (ratio of sulfate aerosol forcing to injection rate) decreases with increasing injection rate (e.g. Heckendorn et al., 2009; Niemeier and Timmreck, 2015).\nSAI is strongly debated, especially the research gaps (e.g. Haywood et al., 2025). However, with progressing climate change and increasing costs and damage, a deployment may become more and more likely. SAI is supposed to be relatively cheap (e.g. Moriyama et al., 2017), and companies or startups may see an option to earn money with SAI (e.g, \u201cMake sunsets\u201d company (Make sunsets, 2024)). Therefore, it is very important to be able to observe relatively small amounts of sulfur aerosols in the atmosphere.\nOne potential way to monitor possible future deployment of SAI is the use of satellite instruments. The SAGE III/ISS (Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment III) instrument, mounted on the International Space Station (ISS), is a currently operating satellite solar occultation instrument. It measures the attenuation of solar radiation due to scattering and absorption of atmospheric components such as ozone, nitrogen dioxide, water vapour, and aerosols. A description of the solar occultation measurement technique can be found in, for example, McCormick et al. (1979). The instrument observes around 15 sunrises and 15 sunsets in 24 h and covers a possible latitude range between 70\u00b0 S and 70\u00b0 N (NASA, 2022). SAGE III/ISS has 12 spectral channels, of which 9 cover aerosols as target species. The nine specific wavelengths are 384, 448, 520, 601, 676, 755, 869, 1021, and 1543 nm (NASA, 2022).\nThe aim of the current study is to investigate whether it is possible to detect stratospheric aerosols formed from small amounts (in the context of possible geoengineering experiments) of sulfur artificially and continuously injected into the stratosphere. Here 1 and 2 Tg S yr\u22121 are considered, which results in a much lower sulfate injection per time compared to a volcanic eruption with the same injected amount, using a satellite solar occultation instrument, like SAGE III/ISS. It is assumed that if these smaller amounts of sulfur (in the context of possible geoengineering experiments) are detectable, larger amounts will also be detectable. Although 1 and 2 Tg S yr\u22121 do not have a significant climatic effect, about \u22120.3 and \u22120.6 W m\u22122 (Niemeier and Timmreck, 2015), these emission rates were chosen to see whether it is possible to detect even these small amounts, taking into account an aerosol extinction retrieval error estimate that is as realistic as possible. This is especially the case in view of the fact that the continuously injected sulfur amounts of 1 and 2 Tg S yr\u22121 lead to much lower injection amounts per time compared to a volcanic eruption with the same amount injected. For this purpose, MAECHAM-HAM simulation results for different SRM scenarios were used.

One idea is to inject sulfur dioxide or sulfuric acid into the stratosphere, where sulfate aerosols are then formed. Such experiments can probably be observed, for example, with satellite occultation instruments like SAGE III/ISS. The aim of the current study is to analyse, using MAECHAM-HAM simulations and retrievals with the radiative transfer program SCIATRAN, whether it is possible to detect the formed stratospheric aerosols from emissions of 1 and 2 Tg S yr\u22121 (sulfur per year) with the currently active satellite occultation instruments, taking into account an error estimate that is as realistic as possible. If these smaller amounts of sulfur are detectable, larger amounts will also be detectable. The calculations show that, considering the natural variability and the assumptions made here, the stratospheric aerosols formed from emissions of 1 and 2 Tg S yr\u22121 in the quasi-steady-state phase can be detected, which is not the case in the first month of the 2-year initial phase.\nGeoengineering, also known as climate engineering, comprises methods and technologies that aim to deliberately change the climate system in order to mitigate the consequences of climate change (IPCC, 2013). One method is solar radiation management (SRM), which aims at modifying the shortwave radiation budget in the climate system by increasing the planetary albedo (IPCC, 2013). The injection of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere (stratospheric aerosol injection, SAI) is one idea of SRM (e.g. Budyko, 1977; Crutzen, 2006), mimicking the effects of large volcanic eruptions where extensive amounts of sulfur dioxide reach the stratosphere. The corresponding radiative forcing of the formed sulfate aerosols depends on the injected amount of sulfur dioxide. Another idea is the injection of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) into the stratosphere (e.g. Vattioni et al., 2019; Janssens et al., 2020; Weisenstein et al., 2022) or carbonyl sulfide (COS) (e.g. Quaglia et al., 2022).\nNote that the exact values of the resulting radiative forcing for the same injection rate may vary depending on the model and set up used (e.g. Niemeier and Tilmes, 2017; Laakso et al., 2022). Simulations with MAECHAM-HAM show that a continuous injection of 10 Tg S yr\u22121 at an altitude of 60 hPa leads to a top of the atmosphere radiative forcing of \u2212(1.79\u20132.06) W m\u22122 (Niemeier and Timmreck, 2015). However, it was shown that the forcing efficiency (ratio of sulfate aerosol forcing to injection rate) decreases with increasing injection rate (e.g. Heckendorn et al., 2009; Niemeier and Timmreck, 2015).\nSAI is strongly debated, especially the research gaps (e.g. Haywood et al., 2025). However, with progressing climate change and increasing costs and damage, a deployment may become more and more likely. SAI is supposed to be relatively cheap (e.g. Moriyama et al., 2017), and companies or startups may see an option to earn money with SAI (e.g, \u201cMake sunsets\u201d company (Make sunsets, 2024)). Therefore, it is very important to be able to observe relatively small amounts of sulfur aerosols in the atmosphere.\nOne potential way to monitor possible future deployment of SAI is the use of satellite instruments. The SAGE III/ISS (Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment III) instrument, mounted on the International Space Station (ISS), is a currently operating satellite solar occultation instrument. It measures the attenuation of solar radiation due to scattering and absorption of atmospheric components such as ozone, nitrogen dioxide, water vapour, and aerosols. A description of the solar occultation measurement technique can be found in, for example, McCormick et al. (1979). The instrument observes around 15 sunrises and 15 sunsets in 24 h and covers a possible latitude range between 70\u00b0 S and 70\u00b0 N (NASA, 2022). SAGE III/ISS has 12 spectral channels, of which 9 cover aerosols as target species. The nine specific wavelengths are 384, 448, 520, 601, 676, 755, 869, 1021, and 1543 nm (NASA, 2022).\nThe aim of the current study is to investigate whether it is possible to detect stratospheric aerosols formed from small amounts (in the context of possible geoengineering experiments) of sulfur artificially and continuously injected into the stratosphere. Here 1 and 2 Tg S yr\u22121 are considered, which results in a much lower sulfate injection per time compared to a volcanic eruption with the same injected amount, using a satellite solar occultation instrument, like SAGE III/ISS. It is assumed that if these smaller amounts of sulfur (in the context of possible geoengineering experiments) are detectable, larger amounts will also be detectable. Although 1 and 2 Tg S yr\u22121 do not have a significant climatic effect, about \u22120.3 and \u22120.6 W m\u22122 (Niemeier and Timmreck, 2015), these emission rates were chosen to see whether it is possible to detect even these small amounts, taking into account an aerosol extinction retrieval error estimate that is as realistic as possible. This is especially the case in view of the fact that the continuously injected sulfur amounts of 1 and 2 Tg S yr\u22121 lead to much lower injection amounts per time compared to a volcanic eruption with the same amount injected. For this purpose, MAECHAM-HAM simulation results for different SRM scenarios were used.

Strong confluence developed ahead of the boundary due to a broad area of high pressure in the Canadian Maritimes and increasing easterly flow ahead of post-Tropical Storm Philippe. An increasingly negatively tilted upper trough and meridional jet stream parallel to the boundary aided in efficient moisture transport while ensuring the boundary was slow to translate east. This front also approached after a period of record breaking warmth, with the Burlington Airport recording 3 daily record max temperatures in a row October 3rd through 5th, with an all-time record for the month of October broken on October 4th of 86 degrees. This record warmth resulted in a sharp thermal gradient that produced strong frontal forcing with precipitable waters near 200 percent of normal around 1.40\u201d. These factors resulted in an extensive period of moderate to locally heavy rain focused along far northeastern New York. Plattsburgh, New York recorded the wettest calendar day in its period of record at 3.94 inches of rain on October 7th. Antecedent dry conditions precluded widespread flood impacts, but portions of northern New York observed some street flooding and minor flooding along the East Branch of the Ausable River. For this analysis, we will explore more of the meteorological factors and context of the event as it relates to the limited impacts experienced.\n500 hPa heights (20,000 feet above ground level) indicated an anomalous deep full latitude trough located over the central Great Lakes at 12 UTC on 07 October 2023, which became negatively tilted as several potent shortwaves rounded the trough base and deepened at all levels. The developing negatively tilted mid/upper level trough, enhanced a deep layer conveyor belt of warm moist air into our region on strong southerly flow of 70 to 100 knots (circled in red in Figure 1 below), resulting in areas of moderate to heavy rainfall. When a system is this deep and closed off at all levels of the atmosphere, movement is generally slow and impacts such as heavy rainfall can linger for multiple hours, especially along a slow moving cold front.\nFigure 1: The 500 hPa (20,000 feet above ground level) upper air height analysis on 07 October 2023 at 12 UTC.

[click to enlarge]\nAnother synoptic scale feature that helped to produce moderate to heavy rainfall across our forecast area was a favorable dual structure of the 250 hPa jet. Figure 2 below shows the 250 hPa jet analysis at 12 UTC on 07 October 2023, which indicates a strong right rear quadrant of the polar jet with winds of 90 to 120 knots. Meanwhile, a weaker subtropical jet was racing across the lower Ohio Valley into the central Appalachian Mountains. The combination of these two jets helped strengthen the upper level shortwave trough, while producing very favorable upper level divergence for strong synoptic scale ascent and localized heavy rainfall. These upper dynamics, combined with a slow moving surface cold front and associated low level convergence contributed to the areas of moderate to heavy rainfall footprint.\nFigure 2: The 250 hPa upper air analysis on 07 October 2023 at 12 UTC.

Values across our region ranged from around 1.0 inch across the western St. Lawrence Valley to 1.4 inches over the northern Champlain Valley at 17 UTC on 07 October 2023. PW values of 1.4 inches were near 200% of normal for early October and the presence of rich moisture resulted in moderate to heavy rainfall, especially as forcing from ascent increased. Deeper moisture with PW values of 1.8-1.9 inches associated with post tropical cyclone Philippe stayed offshore, but curved back into eastern Canada and portions of eastern Maine. The 850 hPa moisture transport vector analysis showed the strongest moisture advection occurring from central/southern New England into parts of the Champlain Valley at 17 UTC on October 7th. Strong moisture advection along a slow moving cold front is another indication of potential heavy rainfall.\nFigure 3: The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) mesoanalysis precipitable water black line (inches) (light green color filled >1.0 inch and darker green color filled >1.50) and 850 hPa moisture transport vector (orangish-brown arrows) on 07 October 2023 at 1700 UTC.

[click to enlarge]\nIn addition to the slow progression of synoptic features, post tropical cyclone Philippe was lifting northwest towards the Maine Coast, steered by a high latitude block. Enhanced easterly flow in the low-levels between Philippe and the deep layer high positioned near Newfoundland enhanced convergence along the boundary. Observing the 1000-925 hPa frontogenesis, almost pure convergence between the accelerating maritime air mass and westerly winds behind the front can be observed across the Champlain Valley, along with a strengthening thermal gradient (Figure 4). Temperatures for much of the week had ranged in the mid 70s to mid 80s across the region, and surface dewpoints had risen into the 60s ahead of the frontal boundary, leaving abundant moisture pre-established across the region (not shown).

For this analysis, we will explore more of the meteorological factors and context of the event as it relates to the limited impacts experienced.\n500 hPa heights (20,000 feet above ground level) indicated an anomalous deep full latitude trough located over the central Great Lakes at 12 UTC on 07 October 2023, which became negatively tilted as several potent shortwaves rounded the trough base and deepened at all levels. The developing negatively tilted mid/upper level trough, enhanced a deep layer conveyor belt of warm moist air into our region on strong southerly flow of 70 to 100 knots (circled in red in Figure 1 below), resulting in areas of moderate to heavy rainfall. When a system is this deep and closed off at all levels of the atmosphere, movement is generally slow and impacts such as heavy rainfall can linger for multiple hours, especially along a slow moving cold front.\nFigure 1: The 500 hPa (20,000 feet above ground level) upper air height analysis on 07 October 2023 at 12 UTC.

[click to enlarge]\nAnother synoptic scale feature that helped to produce moderate to heavy rainfall across our forecast area was a favorable dual structure of the 250 hPa jet. Figure 2 below shows the 250 hPa jet analysis at 12 UTC on 07 October 2023, which indicates a strong right rear quadrant of the polar jet with winds of 90 to 120 knots. Meanwhile, a weaker subtropical jet was racing across the lower Ohio Valley into the central Appalachian Mountains. The combination of these two jets helped strengthen the upper level shortwave trough, while producing very favorable upper level divergence for strong synoptic scale ascent and localized heavy rainfall. These upper dynamics, combined with a slow moving surface cold front and associated low level convergence contributed to the areas of moderate to heavy rainfall footprint.\nFigure 2: The 250 hPa upper air analysis on 07 October 2023 at 12 UTC.

Values across our region ranged from around 1.0 inch across the western St. Lawrence Valley to 1.4 inches over the northern Champlain Valley at 17 UTC on 07 October 2023. PW values of 1.4 inches were near 200% of normal for early October and the presence of rich moisture resulted in moderate to heavy rainfall, especially as forcing from ascent increased. Deeper moisture with PW values of 1.8-1.9 inches associated with post tropical cyclone Philippe stayed offshore, but curved back into eastern Canada and portions of eastern Maine. The 850 hPa moisture transport vector analysis showed the strongest moisture advection occurring from central/southern New England into parts of the Champlain Valley at 17 UTC on October 7th. Strong moisture advection along a slow moving cold front is another indication of potential heavy rainfall.\nFigure 3: The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) mesoanalysis precipitable water black line (inches) (light green color filled >1.0 inch and darker green color filled >1.50) and 850 hPa moisture transport vector (orangish-brown arrows) on 07 October 2023 at 1700 UTC.

Strong confluence developed ahead of the boundary due to a broad area of high pressure in the Canadian Maritimes and increasing easterly flow ahead of post-Tropical Storm Philippe. An increasingly negatively tilted upper trough and meridional jet stream parallel to the boundary aided in efficient moisture transport while ensuring the boundary was slow to translate east. This front also approached after a period of record breaking warmth, with the Burlington Airport recording 3 daily record max temperatures in a row October 3rd through 5th, with an all-time record for the month of October broken on October 4th of 86 degrees. This record warmth resulted in a sharp thermal gradient that produced strong frontal forcing with precipitable waters near 200 percent of normal around 1.40\u201d.
