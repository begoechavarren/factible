      "text": "Hubris is a Greek word that means dangerously overconfident. Based on my research, hubris fairly describes our current response to the issue of climate change. Here\u2019s what many people believe: One: The planet is warming catastrophically because of certain human behaviors. Two: Thanks to powerful computers we can project what the climate will be like 20, 40, or even 100 years from now. Three: That if we eliminate just one behavior, the burning of fossil fuels, we can prevent the climate from changing for as long we like. Each of these presumptions\u2014together, the basis of our hubris regarding the changing climate\u2014is either untrue or so far off the mark as to be useless. Yes, it\u2019s true that the globe is warming, and that humans are exerting a warming influence upon it. But beyond that, to paraphrase a line from the classic movie The Princess Bride, \u201cI do not think \u2018The Science\u2019 says what you think it says.\u201d For example, government reports state clearly that heat waves in the US are now no more common than they were in 1900. Hurricane activity is no different than it was a century ago. Floods have not increased across the globe over more than seventy years. Greenland\u2019s ice sheet isn\u2019t shrinking any more rapidly today than it was 80 years ago. Why aren\u2019t these reassuring facts better known? Because the public gets its climate information almost exclusively from the media. And from a media perspective, fear sells. \u201cThings aren\u2019t that bad\u201d doesn\u2019t sell. Very few people, and that includes journalists who report on climate news, read the actual science. I have. And what the data\u2014the hard science\u2014from the US government and UN Climate reports say is that\u2026 \u201cthings aren\u2019t that bad.\u201d Nor does the public understand the questionable basis of all catastrophic climate change projections: computer modeling. Projecting future climate is excruciatingly difficult. Yes, there are human influences, but the climate is complex. Anyone who says that climate models are \u201cjust physics\u201d either doesn\u2019t understand them or is being deliberately misleading. I should know: I wrote one of the first textbooks on computer modeling. While modelers base their assumptions upon both fundamental physical laws and observations of the climate, there is still considerable judgment involved. And since different modelers will make different assumptions, results vary widely among different models. Let\u2019s just take one simple, but significant assumption modelers must make: the impact of clouds on the climate. Natural fluctuations in the height and coverage of clouds have at least as much of an impact on the flows of sunlight and heat as do human influences. But how can we possibly know global cloud coverage say 10, let alone 50 years from now? Obviously, we can\u2019t. But to create a climate model, we have to make assumptions. That\u2019s a pretty shaky foundation on which to transform the world\u2019s economy. By the way, creating more accurate models isn\u2019t getting any easier. In fact, the more we learn about the climate system, the more we realize how complex it is. Rather than admit this complexity, the media, the politicians, and a good portion of the climate science community attribute every terrible storm, every flood, every major fire to \u201cclimate change.\u201d Yes, we\u2019ve always had these weather events in the past, the narrative goes, but somehow \u201cclimate change\u201d is making everything \u201cworse.\u201d Even if that were true, isn\u2019t the relevant question, how much worse? Not to mention that \u201cworse\u201d is not exactly a scientific term. And how would we make it better? For the alarmists, that\u2019s easy: we get rid of fossil fuels. Not only is this impractical\u2014we get over 80% of the world\u2019s energy from fossil fuels\u2014it\u2019s not scientifically possible. That\u2019s because CO2 doesn\u2019t disappear from the atmosphere in a few days like, say, smog. It hangs around for a really long time. About 60 percent of any CO2 that we emit today will remain in the atmosphere 20 years from now, between 30 and 55 percent will still be there after a century, and between 15 and 30 percent will remain after one thousand years. In other words, it takes centuries for the excess carbon dioxide to vanish from the atmosphere. So, any partial reductions in CO2 emissions would only slow the increase in human influences\u2014not prevent it, let alone reverse it. CO2 is not a knob that we can just turn down to fix everything. We don\u2019t have that ability. To think that we do is\u2026 hubris. Hubris leads to bad decisions. A little humility and a little knowledge would lead to better ones.
