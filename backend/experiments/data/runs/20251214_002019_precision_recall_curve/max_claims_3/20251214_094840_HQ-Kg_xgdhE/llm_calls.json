Roughly every day, prices would double. It was also a time of real hardship and poverty, ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nHyperinflation in Zimbabwe is an ongoing period of currency instability in Zimbabwe which, using Cagan's definition of hyperinflation, began in February 2007. During the height of inflation from 2008 to 2009, it was difficult to measure Zimbabwe's hyperinflation because the government of Zimbabwe stopped filing official inflation statistics. However, Zimbabwe's peak month of inflation is estimated at 79.6 billion percent month-on-month, 89.7 sextillion ( ) percent year-on-year in mid-November 2008.[1] At that time, a $100 trillion banknote could not pay for a simple bus fare.[2]\nIn April 2009, Zimbabwe stopped printing its currency, and currencies from other countries were used.[3] In mid-2015, Zimbabwe announced plans to have completely switched to the United States dollar by the end of that year.[4]\nIn June 2019, the Zimbabwean government announced the reintroduction of the Real Time Gross Settlement dollar (RTGS), to be known simply as the \"Zimbabwe dollar\", and that all foreign currency was no longer legal tender.[5] By mid-July 2019, inflation had increased to 175%, sparking concerns that the country was entering another period of hyperinflation.[6][7] In March 2020, with inflation above 500% annually, a new task force was created to assess the currency problems.[8][9] By July 2020, annual inflation was estimated to be 737%.[10]\nOn 18 April 1980, the Republic of Zimbabwe was born from the former Republic of Rhodesia. The Rhodesian dollar was replaced by the Zimbabwean dollar at par value. When Zimbabwe gained its independence from the United Kingdom, the newly introduced Zimbabwean dollar was initially more valuable than the United States dollar at the official exchange rate. However, that did not reflect reality because, in terms of purchasing power on the open and black markets, it was less valuable, due primarily to the higher inflation in Zimbabwe.[11][12] In its early years, Zimbabwe experienced strong growth and development. Wheat production for non-drought years was proportionally higher than previously, and the tobacco industry was thriving. Economic indicators for the country were strong.\nFrom 1991 to 1996, the Zimbabwean ZANU\u2013PF President Robert Mugabe embarked on an Economic Structural Adjustment Programme (ESAP) that had serious negative effects on Zimbabwe's economy. In the late 1990s, the government instituted land reforms in the name of anti-colonialism intended to evict white landowners and place their holdings in the hands of black farmers. However, many of the new farmers had no experience or training in agriculture.[13] Many farms simply fell into disrepair or were given to Mugabe loyalists. From 1999 to 2009, the country experienced a sharp drop in food production and in all other sectors. The banking sector also collapsed, with farmers unable to obtain loans for capital development. Food output fell 45%, and manufacturing output fell by 29% in 2005, 26% in 2006 and 28% in 2007. Unemployment rose to 80%.[14] Life expectancy dropped.[15] Much of the nation's middle class fled the country en masse taking much of the nation's capital. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe blamed the hyperinflation on economic sanctions imposed by the United States of America, the IMF, and the European Union.[16][17] These sanctions affected the government of Zimbabwe,[18] asset freezes and visa denials targeted at 200 specific Zimbabweans closely tied to the Mugabe regime.[19] There were also restrictions placed on trade with Zimbabwe, by both individual businesses and the US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control.[20]\nA monetarist view[21] is that a general increase in the prices of things is less a commentary on the worth of those things than on the worth of the money. This has objective and subjective components:\nCrucial to both components is discipline over the creation of additional money. However, the Mugabe government was printing money to finance military involvement in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and, in 2000, in the Second Congo War, including higher salaries for army and government officials. Zimbabwe was under-reporting its war spending to the International Monetary Fund by $22 million a month.[22]\nAnother motive for excessive money creation has been self-dealing. Transparency International ranks Zimbabwe's government 157th of 177[23] in terms of institutionalised corruption.[24] The resulting lack of confidence in government undermines confidence in the future and faith in the currency.\nEconomic missteps by government can create shortages and occupy people with workarounds rather than productivity. Though this harms the economy, it does not necessarily undermine the value of the currency, but may harm confidence in the future. Widespread poverty and violence, including government violence to stifle political opposition, also undermines confidence in the future.[25] Land reform lowered agricultural output, especially in tobacco, which accounted for one-third of Zimbabwe's foreign-exchange earnings. Manufacturing and mining also declined. An objective reason was, again, that farms were put in the hands of inexperienced people; and subjectively, that the move undermined the security of property.\nGovernment instability and civic unrest were evident in other areas.[26] Zimbabwean troops, trained by North Korean soldiers, conducted a massacre in the 1980s in the southern provinces of Matabeleland and Midlands, though Mugabe's government cites guerrilla attacks on civilian and state targets. Conflicts between the Ndebele people and Mugabe's government have led to many clashes.[27] There was also unrest between black people and white people, in which the land reform was a factor. One aspect of this reform sought to discriminate against white people specifically and many were forced by the regime to sign over their businesses to the black majority.[28]\nThe Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe responded to the dwindling value of the dollar by repeatedly arranging the printing\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Even the use of the word \"inflation\" has different meanings in different contexts. Many economists, businessmen, and politicians maintain that moderate inflation levels are needed to drive consumption, assuming that higher levels of spending are crucial for economic growth.\nThe Federal Reserve typically targets an annual rate of inflation for the U.S., believing that a slowly increasing price level keeps businesses profitable and prevents consumers from waiting for lower prices before making purchases. There are some, in fact, who believe that the primary function of inflation is to prevent deflation.\nOthers, however, argue that inflation is less important and even a net drag on the economy. Rising prices make savings harder, driving individuals to engage in riskier investment strategies to increase or even maintain their wealth. Some claim that inflation benefits some businesses or individuals at the expense of most others.\nThe Federal Reserve targets a 2% annual inflation rate, believing slow and steady price increases help keep businesses profitable.\nInflation is often used to describe the impact of rising oil or food prices on the economy. For example, if the price of oil goes from $75 a barrel to $100 a barrel, input prices for businesses will increase and transportation costs for everyone will also increase. This may cause many other prices to rise in response.\nHowever, most economists consider the actual definition of inflation to be slightly different. Inflation is a function of the supply and demand for money, meaning that producing relatively more dollars causes each dollar to become less valuable, forcing the general price level to rise.\nWhen the economy is not running at capacity, meaning there is unused labor or resources, inflation theoretically helps increase production. More dollars translates to more spending, which equates to more aggregated demand. More demand, in turn, triggers more production to meet that demand.\nBritish economist John Maynard Keynes believed that some inflation was necessary to prevent the Paradox of Thrift. Which says, if consumer prices are allowed to fall consistently because the country is becoming too productive, consumers learn to hold off their purchases to wait for a better deal. The net effect of this paradox is to reduce aggregate demand, leading to less production, layoffs, and a faltering economy.\nInflation also makes it easier on debtors, who repay their loans with money that is less valuable than the money they borrowed. This encourages borrowing and lending, which again increases spending on all levels. Perhaps most important to the Federal Reserve is that the U.S. government is the largest debtor in the world, and inflation helps soften the blow of its massive debt.\nEconomists once believed an inverse relationship existed between inflation and unemployment, and that rising unemployment could be fought with increased inflation. This relationship was defined in the famous Phillips curve. The Phillips curve was largely discredited in the 1970s when the U.S. experienced stagflation.\nThis article was written by Staff Author from Investopedia Stock Analysis and was legally licensed through the NewsCred publisher network.

In the late 1990s, the government instituted land reforms in the name of anti-colonialism intended to evict white landowners and place their holdings in the hands of black farmers. However, many of the new farmers had no experience or training in agriculture.[13] Many farms simply fell into disrepair or were given to Mugabe loyalists. From 1999 to 2009, the country experienced a sharp drop in food production and in all other sectors. The banking sector also collapsed, with farmers unable to obtain loans for capital development. Food output fell 45%, and manufacturing output fell by 29% in 2005, 26% in 2006 and 28% in 2007. Unemployment rose to 80%.[14] Life expectancy dropped.[15] Much of the nation's middle class fled the country en masse taking much of the nation's capital. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe blamed the hyperinflation on economic sanctions imposed by the United States of America, the IMF, and the European Union.[16][17] These sanctions affected the government of Zimbabwe,[18] asset freezes and visa denials targeted at 200 specific Zimbabweans closely tied to the Mugabe regime.[19] There were also restrictions placed on trade with Zimbabwe, by both individual businesses and the US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control.[20]\nA monetarist view[21] is that a general increase in the prices of things is less a commentary on the worth of those things than on the worth of the money. This has objective and subjective components:\nCrucial to both components is discipline over the creation of additional money. However, the Mugabe government was printing money to finance military involvement in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and, in 2000, in the Second Congo War, including higher salaries for army and government officials. Zimbabwe was under-reporting its war spending to the International Monetary Fund by $22 million a month.[22]\nAnother motive for excessive money creation has been self-dealing. Transparency International ranks Zimbabwe's government 157th of 177[23] in terms of institutionalised corruption.[24] The resulting lack of confidence in government undermines confidence in the future and faith in the currency.\nEconomic missteps by government can create shortages and occupy people with workarounds rather than productivity. Though this harms the economy, it does not necessarily undermine the value of the currency, but may harm confidence in the future. Widespread poverty and violence, including government violence to stifle political opposition, also undermines confidence in the future.[25] Land reform lowered agricultural output, especially in tobacco, which accounted for one-third of Zimbabwe's foreign-exchange earnings. Manufacturing and mining also declined. An objective reason was, again, that farms were put in the hands of inexperienced people; and subjectively, that the move undermined the security of property.\nGovernment instability and civic unrest were evident in other areas.[26] Zimbabwean troops, trained by North Korean soldiers, conducted a massacre in the 1980s in the southern provinces of Matabeleland and Midlands, though Mugabe's government cites guerrilla attacks on civilian and state targets. Conflicts between the Ndebele people and Mugabe's government have led to many clashes.[27] There was also unrest between black people and white people, in which the land reform was a factor. One aspect of this reform sought to discriminate against white people specifically and many were forced by the regime to sign over their businesses to the black majority.[28]\nThe Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe responded to the dwindling value of the dollar by repeatedly arranging the printing\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This may cause many other prices to rise in response.\nHowever, most economists consider the actual definition of inflation to be slightly different. Inflation is a function of the supply and demand for money, meaning that producing relatively more dollars causes each dollar to become less valuable, forcing the general price level to rise.\nWhen the economy is not running at capacity, meaning there is unused labor or resources, inflation theoretically helps increase production. More dollars translates to more spending, which equates to more aggregated demand. More demand, in turn, triggers more production to meet that demand.\nBritish economist John Maynard Keynes believed that some inflation was necessary to prevent the Paradox of Thrift.

The net effect of this paradox is to reduce aggregate demand, leading to less production, layoffs, and a faltering economy.\nInflation also makes it easier on debtors, who repay their loans with money that is less valuable than the money they borrowed.

The Rhodesian dollar was replaced by the Zimbabwean dollar at par value. When Zimbabwe gained its independence from the United Kingdom, the newly introduced Zimbabwean dollar was initially more valuable than the United States dollar at the official exchange rate. However, that did not reflect reality because, in terms of purchasing power on the open and black markets, it was less valuable, due primarily to the higher inflation in Zimbabwe.[11][12] In its early years, Zimbabwe experienced strong growth and development.

Transparency International ranks Zimbabwe's government 157th of 177[23] in terms of institutionalised corruption.[24] The resulting lack of confidence in government undermines confidence in the future and faith in the currency.\nEconomic missteps by government can create shortages and occupy people with workarounds rather than productivity. Though this harms the economy, it does not necessarily undermine the value of the currency, but may harm confidence in the future. Widespread poverty and violence, including government violence to stifle political opposition, also undermines confidence in the future.[25] Land reform lowered agricultural output, especially in tobacco, which accounted for one-third of Zimbabwe's foreign-exchange earnings. Manufacturing and mining also declined. An objective reason was, again, that farms were put in the hands of inexperienced people; and subjectively, that the move undermined the security of property.\nGovernment instability and civic unrest were evident in other areas.[26] Zimbabwean troops, trained by North Korean soldiers, conducted a massacre in the 1980s in the southern provinces of Matabeleland and Midlands, though Mugabe's government cites guerrilla attacks on civilian and state targets. Conflicts between the Ndebele people and Mugabe's government have led to many clashes.[27] There was also unrest between black people and white people, in which the land reform was a factor. One aspect of this reform sought to discriminate against white people specifically and many were forced by the regime to sign over their businesses to the black majority.[28]\nThe Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe responded to the dwindling value of the dollar by repeatedly arranging the printing\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Even the use of the word \"inflation\" has different meanings in different contexts. Many economists, businessmen, and politicians maintain that moderate inflation levels are needed to drive consumption, assuming that higher levels of spending are crucial for economic growth.\nThe Federal Reserve typically targets an annual rate of inflation for the U.S., believing that a slowly increasing price level keeps businesses profitable and prevents consumers from waiting for lower prices before making purchases. There are some, in fact, who believe that the primary function of inflation is to prevent deflation.\nOthers, however, argue that inflation is less important and even a net drag on the economy. Rising prices make savings harder, driving individuals to engage in riskier investment strategies to increase or even maintain their wealth. Some claim that inflation benefits some businesses or individuals at the expense of most others.\nThe Federal Reserve targets a 2% annual inflation rate, believing slow and steady price increases help keep businesses profitable.\nInflation is often used to describe the impact of rising oil or food prices on the economy. For example, if the price of oil goes from $75 a barrel to $100 a barrel, input prices for businesses will increase and transportation costs for everyone will also increase. This may cause many other prices to rise in response.\nHowever, most economists consider the actual definition of inflation to be slightly different. Inflation is a function of the supply and demand for money, meaning that producing relatively more dollars causes each dollar to become less valuable, forcing the general price level to rise.\nWhen the economy is not running at capacity, meaning there is unused labor or resources, inflation theoretically helps increase production. More dollars translates to more spending, which equates to more aggregated demand. More demand, in turn, triggers more production to meet that demand.\nBritish economist John Maynard Keynes believed that some inflation was necessary to prevent the Paradox of Thrift. Which says, if consumer prices are allowed to fall consistently because the country is becoming too productive, consumers learn to hold off their purchases to wait for a better deal. The net effect of this paradox is to reduce aggregate demand, leading to less production, layoffs, and a faltering economy.\nInflation also makes it easier on debtors, who repay their loans with money that is less valuable than the money they borrowed. This encourages borrowing and lending, which again increases spending on all levels. Perhaps most important to the Federal Reserve is that the U.S. government is the largest debtor in the world, and inflation helps soften the blow of its massive debt.\nEconomists once believed an inverse relationship existed between inflation and unemployment, and that rising unemployment could be fought with increased inflation. This relationship was defined in the famous Phillips curve. The Phillips curve was largely discredited in the 1970s when the U.S. experienced stagflation.\nThis article was written by Staff Author from Investopedia Stock Analysis and was legally licensed through the NewsCred publisher network.

Hopscotching among decades, we have the ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nWith hungry steelworkers to feed, the owner of the Uniontown, Pennsylvania McDonald\u2019s needed something better than (what he described as) a puny cheeseburger. His solution was a double-decker burger. The McDonald\u2019s HQ executives said it was okay\u2026only if he used no new ingredients. Still, he reputedly snuck in a sesame seed bun from a local bakery. And the rest of the story is history.\nWe\u2019ve had Big Macs since 1967.\nBig Mac Prices\nAccording to McDonald\u2019s menus, a Big Mac would have cost us approximately 45 cents during the 1960s. Hopscotching among decades, we have the 1970s Big Mac at 65 cents and then $1.60 during the 1980s. I am guessing that the leap was because of the last great inflation during the early 1980s. (According to the National Restaurant Association, at 7.2 percent, the 12 month April to April jump in average menu prices was the most since 1981.)\nBig Mac Meal Prices\nIn this graph from 2012, Big Mac price hikes topped the CPI. Between 1986 and 2012, the Big Mac went up 171 percent from $1.60 to $4.33. Meanwhile, the CPI increase was 107 percent. (I am assuming that they are pricing the Big Mac meal here rather than just the Big Mac):\nNow again, Big Mac prices are rising. The CPI\u2019s inflation calculator tells us that last month we needed $6.11 for that January $5.94 burger, fries, and a soda. And indeed, the average current U.S. price of a Big Mac meal is $6.05:\nAlthough the company won\u2019t say for sure, it appears likely that soon we will be paying more for the Big Mac.\nContaining beef, cheese, and wheat, a Big Mac is a good barometer of food inflation. Less obvious but also in the bun, we have the cost of labor (rising), of transportation (rising), and tariffs:\nMy sources and more: Thanks to Statista for the email that led to today\u2019s post. From there, my Big Mac history came from here, here, and here Our featured image is from Insider while the Visual Capitalist had the most compelling price history graphics. Then, this industry website reported the rising price of cheese while the BLS has it all. (Please note that today I could use some help. None of my Big Mac price history sources distinguished between the burger alone and the meal. Please let me know if you disagree with my conclusions.

Moderate inflation is associated with economic growth, while high inflation can signal an overheated ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nWhen people think of inflation, they often view it through the lens of everyday items like a dozen eggs, a loaf of bread, or the price of gas at the pump.\nEconomists generally define inflation as the increase in prices for goods and services over a given time frame, like monthly or annually. While the average person most often just notices that increase in prices, the change in the cost of goods can take many forms, such as inflation, deflation, and disinflation. You may have even heard of \"stagflation.\" So, what do these different terms mean and how can changes in inflation impact financial markets and investment portfolios?\nA few different terms are used to describe potential trends in prices. It's important to know them all:\nFor consumers, the rate of inflation is important because it impacts purchasing power. The more prices increase beyond incomes, the more budgets get squeezed, especially for those living on a fixed income like many retirees. Periods of disinflation are welcome news because consumers' purchasing power isn't eroding as quickly, as long as incomes are steady or rising.\nPeriods of deflation are typically viewed as a bad omen because falling prices for goods and services indicate a weak economy, sluggish demand, and falling asset prices. Also, when people believe prices are heading down, they might delay purchases. Less spending typically translates into less profitability for retailers and producers, which can result in higher unemployment.\nExcept for modest decline in prices in 2009, the United States hasn't experienced any meaningful bouts of deflation in more than 60 years. And, while there were some fears that the United States might see a period of stagflation after the pandemic, the economy never entered a protracted recession; instead, the economy experienced some \"rolling\" recessions, where certain industries like housing suffered, but other parts of the economy remained resilient. Periods of stagflation have been relatively uncommon as well.\nWhile inflation has many influences, the primary cause is an imbalance between supply and demand in the economy. If demand for goods, services, or labor exceeds the economy's capacity, then prices rise.\nIt's generally accepted that a country's monetary and fiscal policies can influence inflation because it can discourage or encourage spending or boost the production of goods and services. Consequently, it can have a big impact on inflation; if there's extra money, the country's currency becomes less valuable, making things more expensive.\nWhen there's a significant change in the production of goods, it typically impacts prices too. If there's a breakdown in a supply chain or some other unexpected event, for example, it can affect entire industries and the products they sell. During the pandemic, people stuck at home spent money shopping online for on goods because they couldn't spend money on services. At the same time, they couldn't get goods easily because of supply-chain bottlenecks. As the economy opened up, people were less interested in buying many of those stay-at-home goods. Instead, they wanted the haircuts, dinners out, and vacations that they had put off. This sent services inflation soaring.\nSimilarly, rising oil and gasoline prices (or other raw materials commonly used in production) can lead companies to charge higher prices to offset their increased costs from transporting or producing goods, which can lead to higher inflation. Tariffs, which increase the cost of imported goods, can also have an impact on a country's inflation rate. Natural disasters, changes in regulation, labor costs, and fluctuations in a country's currency are a few other factors.\nLastly, the mere expectations of inflation can have a self-feeding effect. When individuals or companies anticipate higher prices, they begin to price in those expectations into products, contracts, and wage negotiations. If those expectations are based on what has happened in the recent past, they might ask for higher wages or better pricing for their products or contracts in the future\u2014a phenomenon known as inflation \"inertia.\"\nFor investors, inflation can be viewed as a positive and a potential negative. For example, stocks, real estate, and some commodities have historically increased in value over the long term along with inflation. Some investments, such as Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), are directly linked to the pace of inflation and offer better returns when inflation increases.\nInvestors are concerned about not only declining purchasing power but also the potential impact of inflation on interest rates. The Federal Reserve has a mandate to keep a lid on inflation and its primary tool for combatting rising prices is to raise interest rates, which it did multiple times from March 2022 to July 2023.\nHigher interest rates are nice for income-oriented investors because they can potentially earn more income on the higher yields. At the same time, higher rates can make it more difficult for individuals and businesses to borrow money and spend, which can be a headwind for business activity and economic growth. On the other hand, when the Federal Reserve lowers rates, the intention is typically to stimulate economic growth without igniting the forces of inflation.\nThis time around, the Fed is likely to cut rates to hopefully maintain a restrictive policy rather than as a means to stimulate the economy. The Fed focuses on the \"real\" interest rate, or the inflation-adjusted rate. The \"real\" federal funds rate can be calculated by subtracting the inflation rate from the federal funds rate. Cutting the interest rate allows the real rate of interest to stay steady while the inflation rate falls.\nEconomically sensitive sectors of the stock market and other assets that tend to benefit from robust economic growth, like energy or basic materials, can sometimes see an increase in volatility if there's a growing perception that a central bank will begin\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Austrian economists, however, point out ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nWhen people think of inflation, they often view it through the lens of everyday items like a dozen eggs, a loaf of bread, or the price of gas at the pump.\nEconomists generally define inflation as the increase in prices for goods and services over a given time frame, like monthly or annually. While the average person most often just notices that increase in prices, the change in the cost of goods can take many forms, such as inflation, deflation, and disinflation. You may have even heard of \"stagflation.\" So, what do these different terms mean and how can changes in inflation impact financial markets and investment portfolios?\nA few different terms are used to describe potential trends in prices. It's important to know them all:\nFor consumers, the rate of inflation is important because it impacts purchasing power. The more prices increase beyond incomes, the more budgets get squeezed, especially for those living on a fixed income like many retirees. Periods of disinflation are welcome news because consumers' purchasing power isn't eroding as quickly, as long as incomes are steady or rising.\nPeriods of deflation are typically viewed as a bad omen because falling prices for goods and services indicate a weak economy, sluggish demand, and falling asset prices. Also, when people believe prices are heading down, they might delay purchases. Less spending typically translates into less profitability for retailers and producers, which can result in higher unemployment.\nExcept for modest decline in prices in 2009, the United States hasn't experienced any meaningful bouts of deflation in more than 60 years. And, while there were some fears that the United States might see a period of stagflation after the pandemic, the economy never entered a protracted recession; instead, the economy experienced some \"rolling\" recessions, where certain industries like housing suffered, but other parts of the economy remained resilient. Periods of stagflation have been relatively uncommon as well.\nWhile inflation has many influences, the primary cause is an imbalance between supply and demand in the economy. If demand for goods, services, or labor exceeds the economy's capacity, then prices rise.\nIt's generally accepted that a country's monetary and fiscal policies can influence inflation because it can discourage or encourage spending or boost the production of goods and services. Consequently, it can have a big impact on inflation; if there's extra money, the country's currency becomes less valuable, making things more expensive.\nWhen there's a significant change in the production of goods, it typically impacts prices too. If there's a breakdown in a supply chain or some other unexpected event, for example, it can affect entire industries and the products they sell. During the pandemic, people stuck at home spent money shopping online for on goods because they couldn't spend money on services. At the same time, they couldn't get goods easily because of supply-chain bottlenecks. As the economy opened up, people were less interested in buying many of those stay-at-home goods. Instead, they wanted the haircuts, dinners out, and vacations that they had put off. This sent services inflation soaring.\nSimilarly, rising oil and gasoline prices (or other raw materials commonly used in production) can lead companies to charge higher prices to offset their increased costs from transporting or producing goods, which can lead to higher inflation. Tariffs, which increase the cost of imported goods, can also have an impact on a country's inflation rate. Natural disasters, changes in regulation, labor costs, and fluctuations in a country's currency are a few other factors.\nLastly, the mere expectations of inflation can have a self-feeding effect. When individuals or companies anticipate higher prices, they begin to price in those expectations into products, contracts, and wage negotiations. If those expectations are based on what has happened in the recent past, they might ask for higher wages or better pricing for their products or contracts in the future\u2014a phenomenon known as inflation \"inertia.\"\nFor investors, inflation can be viewed as a positive and a potential negative. For example, stocks, real estate, and some commodities have historically increased in value over the long term along with inflation. Some investments, such as Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), are directly linked to the pace of inflation and offer better returns when inflation increases.\nInvestors are concerned about not only declining purchasing power but also the potential impact of inflation on interest rates. The Federal Reserve has a mandate to keep a lid on inflation and its primary tool for combatting rising prices is to raise interest rates, which it did multiple times from March 2022 to July 2023.\nHigher interest rates are nice for income-oriented investors because they can potentially earn more income on the higher yields. At the same time, higher rates can make it more difficult for individuals and businesses to borrow money and spend, which can be a headwind for business activity and economic growth. On the other hand, when the Federal Reserve lowers rates, the intention is typically to stimulate economic growth without igniting the forces of inflation.\nThis time around, the Fed is likely to cut rates to hopefully maintain a restrictive policy rather than as a means to stimulate the economy. The Fed focuses on the \"real\" interest rate, or the inflation-adjusted rate. The \"real\" federal funds rate can be calculated by subtracting the inflation rate from the federal funds rate. Cutting the interest rate allows the real rate of interest to stay steady while the inflation rate falls.\nEconomically sensitive sectors of the stock market and other assets that tend to benefit from robust economic growth, like energy or basic materials, can sometimes see an increase in volatility if there's a growing perception that a central bank will begin\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",
