But this figure once attained, the lucky ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nThe Class Struggles in France, 1848 to 1850\nThe same symptoms have shown themselves in France since 1849, and particularly since the beginning of 1850. The Parisian industries are abundantly employed and the cotton factories of Rouen and Mulhouse are also doing pretty well, although here, as in England, the high prices of the raw material have exercised a retarding influence. The development of prosperity in France was, in addition, especially promoted by the comprehensive tariff reform in Spain and by the reduction of the duties on various luxury articles in Mexico; the export of French commodities to both markets has considerably increased. The growth of capital in France led to a series of speculations, for which the exploitation of the California gold mines on a large scale served as a pretext.[121] A swarm of companies have sprung up; the low denomination of their shares and their socialist-colored prospectuses appeal directly to the purses of the petty bourgeois and the workers, but all and sundry result in that sheer swindling which is characteristic of the French and Chinese alone. One of these companies is even patronized directly by the government. The import duties in France during the first nine months of 1848 amounted to 63,000,000 francs, of 1849 to 95,000,000 francs, and of 1850 to 93,000,000 francs. Moreover, in the month of September, 1850, they again rose by more than a million compared with the same month of 1849. Exports also rose in 1849, and still more in 1850.\nThe most striking proof of restored prosperity is the Bank's reintroduction of specie payment by the law of August 6, 1850. On March 15, 1848, the Bank had been authorized to suspend specie payment. Its note circulation, including that of the provincial banks, amounted at that time to 373,000,000 francs (14,920,000 pounds). On November 2, 1849, this circulation amounted to 482,000,000 francs, or 19,280,000, an increase of 4,360,000 pounds, and on September 2, 1850, to 496,000,000 francs, or 19,840,000 pounds, an increase of about 5,000,000 pounds. This was not accompanied by any depreciation of the notes; on the contrary , the increased circulation of the notes was accompanied by the steadily increasing accumulation of gold and silver in the vaults of the Bank, so that in the summer of 1850 its metallic reserve amounted to about 141,000,000 pounds, an unprecedented sum in France. That the Bank was thus placed in a position to increase its circulation and therewith its active capital by 123,000,000 francs, or 5,000,000 pounds, is striking proof of the correctness of our assertion in an earlier issue that the finance aristocracy has not only not been overthrown by the revolution, but has even been strengthened. This result becomes still more evident from the following survey of French bank legislation during the last few years. On June 10, 1847, the Bank was authorized to issue notes of 200 francs; hitherto the smallest denomination had been 500 francs. A decree of March 15, 1848, declared the notes of the Bank of France legal tender and relieved it of the obligation of redeeming them in specie. Its note issue was limited to 350,000,000 francs. It was simultaneously authorized to issue notes of 100 francs. A decree of April 27 prescribed the merging of the departmental banks in the Bank of France; another decree, of May 2, 1848, increased the latter's note issue to 442,000,000 francs. A decree of December 22, 1849, raised the maximum of the note issue to 525,000,000 francs. Finally, the law of August 6, 1850, reestablished the exchangeability of notes for specie. These facts, the continual increase in the circulation, the concentration of the whole of French credit in the hands of the Bank, and the accumulation of all French gold and silver in the Bank's vaults led M. Proudhon to the conclusion that the Bank must now shed its old snakeskin and metamorphose itself into a Proudhonist people's bank.[122] He did not even need to know the history of the English bank restriction from 1797 to 1819;[123] he only needed to direct his glance across the Channel to see that this fact, for him unprecedented in the history of bourgeois society, was nothing more than a very normal bourgeois event, which only now occurred in France for the first time. One sees that the allegedly revolutionary theoreticians who, after the Provisional Government, talked big in Paris were just as ignorant of the nature and the results of the measures taken as the gentlemen of the Provisional Government themselves.\nIn spite of the industrial and commercial prosperity that France momentarily enjoys, the mass of the people, the twenty-five million peasants, suffer from a great depression. The good harvests of the past few years have forced the prices of corn much lower even than in England, and the position of the peasants under such circumstances, in debt, sucked dry by usury and crushed by taxes, must be anything but splendid. The history of the past three years has, however, provided sufficient proof that this class of the population is absolutely incapable of any revolutionary initiative.\nJust as the period of crisis began later on the Continent than in England, so also did prosperity. The process originated in England, which is the demiurge of the bourgeois cosmos. On the Continent the various phases of the cycle repeatedly experienced by bourgeois society assume a secondary and tertiary form. First, the Continent exports to England disproportionately more than to any other country. This export to England, however, depends on the latter's position, especially in regard to the overseas market. England exports disproportionately more to overseas countries than to the whole Continent, so that the quantity of continental exports to those countries is always dependent on England's foreign trade. Hence when crises on the Continent produce revolutions there first, the bases for them are always laid in England. Violent outbreaks naturally erupt sooner \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

On November 2, 1849, this circulation amounted to 482,000,000 francs, or 19,280,000, an increase of 4,360,000 pounds, and on September 2, 1850, to 496,000,000 francs, or 19,840,000 pounds, an increase of about 5,000,000 pounds. This was not accompanied by any depreciation of the notes; on the contrary , the increased circulation of the notes was accompanied by the steadily increasing accumulation of gold and silver in the vaults of the Bank, so that in the summer of 1850 its metallic reserve amounted to about 141,000,000 pounds, an unprecedented sum in France. That the Bank was thus placed in a position to increase its circulation and therewith its active capital by 123,000,000 francs, or 5,000,000 pounds, is striking proof of the correctness of our assertion in an earlier issue that the finance aristocracy has not only not been overthrown by the revolution, but has even been strengthened. This result becomes still more evident from the following survey of French bank legislation during the last few years. On June 10, 1847, the Bank was authorized to issue notes of 200 francs; hitherto the smallest denomination had been 500 francs. A decree of March 15, 1848, declared the notes of the Bank of France legal tender and relieved it of the obligation of redeeming them in specie. Its note issue was limited to 350,000,000 francs. It was simultaneously authorized to issue notes of 100 francs. A decree of April 27 prescribed the merging of the departmental banks in the Bank of France; another decree, of May 2, 1848, increased the latter's note issue to 442,000,000 francs. A decree of December 22, 1849, raised the maximum of the note issue to 525,000,000 francs. Finally, the law of August 6, 1850, reestablished the exchangeability of notes for specie. These facts, the continual increase in the circulation, the concentration of the whole of French credit in the hands of the Bank, and the accumulation of all French gold and silver in the Bank's vaults led M. Proudhon to the conclusion that the Bank must now shed its old snakeskin and metamorphose itself into a Proudhonist people's bank.[122] He did not even need to know the history of the English bank restriction from 1797 to 1819;[123] he only needed to direct his glance across the Channel to see that this fact, for him unprecedented in the history of bourgeois society, was nothing more than a very normal bourgeois event, which only now occurred in France for the first time. One sees that the allegedly revolutionary theoreticians who, after the Provisional Government, talked big in Paris were just as ignorant of the nature and the results of the measures taken as the gentlemen of the Provisional Government themselves.\nIn spite of the industrial and commercial prosperity that France momentarily enjoys, the mass of the people, the twenty-five million peasants, suffer from a great depression. The good harvests of the past few years have forced the prices of corn much lower even than in England, and the position of the peasants under such circumstances, in debt, sucked dry by usury and crushed by taxes, must be anything but splendid.

The Parisian industries are abundantly employed and the cotton factories of Rouen and Mulhouse are also doing pretty well, although here, as in England, the high prices of the raw material have exercised a retarding influence. The development of prosperity in France was, in addition, especially promoted by the comprehensive tariff reform in Spain and by the reduction of the duties on various luxury articles in Mexico; the export of French commodities to both markets has considerably increased. The growth of capital in France led to a series of speculations, for which the exploitation of the California gold mines on a large scale served as a pretext.[121] A swarm of companies have sprung up; the low denomination of their shares and their socialist-colored prospectuses appeal directly to the purses of the petty bourgeois and the workers, but all and sundry result in that sheer swindling which is characteristic of the French and Chinese alone. One of these companies is even patronized directly by the government. The import duties in France during the first nine months of 1848 amounted to 63,000,000 francs, of 1849 to 95,000,000 francs, and of 1850 to 93,000,000 francs. Moreover, in the month of September, 1850, they again rose by more than a million compared with the same month of 1849. Exports also rose in 1849, and still more in 1850.\nThe most striking proof of restored prosperity is the Bank's reintroduction of specie payment by the law of August 6, 1850. On March 15, 1848, the Bank had been authorized to suspend specie payment. Its note circulation, including that of the provincial banks, amounted at that time to 373,000,000 francs (14,920,000 pounds).

Raimondo,[1] is that the Constitution contains an implied right to an education that adequately prepares students to become capable citizens and participate in democracy. The lawsuit claims that, as a result of their failure to provide this necessary basic education, state officials, including then-Governor Gina Raimondo, have violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nThe largest obstacle for the Cook plaintiffs is the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 1973 holding in San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez.[2] In Rodriguez, the Court declared that the Constitution does not guarantee equality of education. The Rodriguez case involved a challenge to the school district funding system in Texas. Because the funding system was primarily based on local property taxes, it resulted in significant disparities and state funding failed to equalize per-pupil expenditures. In ruling that education was not a \u201cfundamental interest,\u201d the Supreme Court rejected the claim that the funding system must pass a strict scrutiny standard of review.[3] The Rodriguez decision seems to have foreclosed any educational equity challenges in federal courts. In his order dismissing the Cook case, Judge Smith noted that the \u201carc of the law in this area is clear.\u201d\nDissenting opinions in Rodriguez by Justices Thurgood Marshall and William Brennan argued that there is an implied right to education in the Constitution because education is fundamental to the exercise of other constitutional rights\u2014namely the First Amendment right to freedom of expression\u2014and the fundamental interest in voting. The plaintiffs in Cook invoke this reasoning by arguing that students require an adequate education to \u201cfunction productively as civic participants capable of voting, serving on a jury, understanding economic, social, and political systems sufficiently to make informed choices, and to participate effectively in civic activities.\u201d[4]\nIt remains to be seen how the Cook plaintiffs will fare on their appeal to the First Circuit, but there is undoubtedly a need for a newfound priority on civic education by the States in the spirit of Cook and Justice Marshall\u2019s dissent. As Judge Smith wrote, Cook is \u201ca cry for help from a generation of young people who are destined to inherit a country which we\u2014the generation currently in charge\u2014are not stewarding well,\u201d while concluding that \u201c[h]opefully, others who have the power to address this need will respond appropriately.\u201d\nThe State of Civic Education\nIn the United States, the federal government funds STEM education at an annual rate of $50 per student. Civics and history? Five cents. And the disparity is not because the latter contains little room for improvement. That three out of five Americans adults cannot name the three branches of government is concerning. And that only one-third could pass the civics test for naturalization generates many thoughts.\nOne reaction to this clear need for more civic education is the nearly twenty states that have implemented a civics test as a requirement for high school graduation\u2014usually in the form of multiple-choice questions taken from the USCIS naturalization test. While necessary, traditional civics knowledge is certainly not a sufficient condition for generating an informed citizenry and building a strong democracy. Something more is needed: perfect scores on civics exams may do little to stem the trends of asymmetric partisanship and hyper-polarization, virulent discourse, \u201cBig Lies,\u201d and political discussions often void of substantive policy issues\u2014by voters and candidates, alike. More worrying than citizens forgetting the specific First Amendment freedoms is a declining trust in government and a lack of engagement in civic life\u2014or that the Economist Intelligence Unit rates the United States as a \u201cflawed democracy,\u201d largely as a result of low ratings in the \u201cfunctioning of government\u201d and \u201cpolitical culture\u201d parameters.\nCivic education must teach students how government works. But it should also engage students in their community and help all students feel equipped to participate in civic life\u2014ideals not achievable solely by fact-based multiple-choice testing. To that end, the Brown Center on Education Policy at the Brookings Institution has recommended ten proven practices that are critical for high-quality civic education\u2014with only one relating to curriculum content.\nIn a recently released report, titled \u201cA Roadmap to Educating for American Democracy,\u201d the Educating for American Democracy Initiative calls for a shift from \u201cbreadth to depth\u201d in civic and history K-12 education with an emphasis on a shared and ideologically pluralist national conversation. This roadmap is neither content-neutral nor fact-based: rather, it seeks to promote student inquiry through conceptual \u201cdriving questions\u201d and interpersonal civic engagement.

The system and ideas employed by the ancient Greeks had profound influences on how democracy developed, and its impact on the formation of the U.S. government.\n5 - 8\nSocial Studies, Ancient Civilizations\nThe ancient Greeks were the first to create a democracy. The word \u201cdemocracy\u201d comes from two Greek words that mean people (demos) and rule (kratos). Democracy is the idea that the citizens of a country should take an active role in the government of their country and manage it directly or through elected representatives. In addition, it supports the idea that the people can replace their government through peaceful transfers of power rather than violent uprising or revolution. Thus, a key part of democracy is that the people have a voice.\nThe first known democracy in the world was in Athens. Athenian democracy developed around the fifth century B.C.E. The Greek idea of democracy was different from present-day democracy because, in Athens, all adult citizens were required to take an active part in the government. If they did not fulfill their duty they would be fined and sometimes marked with red paint. The Athenian definition of \u201ccitizens\u201d was also different from modern-day citizens: only free men were considered citizens in Athens. Women, children, and slaves were not considered citizens and therefore could not vote.\nEach year 500 names were chosen from all the citizens of ancient Athens. Those 500 citizens had to actively serve in the government for one year. During that year, they were responsible for making new laws and controlled all parts of the political process. When a new law was proposed, all the citizens of Athens had the opportunity to vote on it. To vote, citizens had to attend the assembly on the day the vote took place. This form of government is called direct democracy.\nThe United States has a representative democracy. Representative democracy is a government in which citizens vote for representatives who create and change laws that govern the people rather than getting to vote directly on the laws themselves.\nCitizenship is the status of being a citizen, belonging to a nation, and having the associated rights and responsibilities.\nAncient Greek politics, philosophy, art and scientific achievements greatly influenced Western civilizations today. One example of their legacy is the Olympic Games.\nNational Geographic Headquarters 1145 17th Street NW Washington, DC 20036\nNational Geographic Society is a 501 (c)(3) organization. \u00a9 1996 - 2025 National Geographic Society.

The UN supports democracy by promoting human rights, development, and peace and security. In the 79 years since the UN Charter was signed, the UN has done more to support democracy around the world than any other global organization. The UN promotes good governance, monitors elections, supports civil society to strengthen democratic institutions and accountability, ensures self-determination in decolonized countries, and assists in the drafting of new constitutions in post-conflict nations.\nUnited Nations activities in support of democracy are carried out through the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Democracy Fund (UNDEF), the Department of Peace Operations (DPO), the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs (DPPA), the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR),and the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women), among others.\nWhen the founders of the United Nations drafted the United Nations Charter, they did not mention the word democracy. In 1945, many of the UN Member States did not endorse democracy as a system or didn\u2019t practice it.

Before we dive in with our new essential question, I want to take a moment to reflect back on what we\u2019ve learned so far. In the first unit, we explored the question \u201cwhat is democracy?\u201d\nEveryone in the room is going to get a Post-it note. I want you to write the single most important thing you feel you learned while we explored that question. Put another way: what is one thing you want to make sure your community knows about democracy?\nSLIDE 2 Now we are going to shift gears to unit two. We\u2019ve learned that democracy means a government where the people rule. But what does that actually look like? In the next two lessons, we are going to explore sources from ancient Athens and the early US to answer the question \u201cHow does democracy work?\u201d\nFor the duration of the institute, we recommend using this popular protest chant whenever you need to get the students\u2019 attention. This is in keeping with the spirit of The Academy and reinforces both the playful and civic elements of the program.\nTo help set the tone that this is going to be more like a history lab or camp than a typical classroom lesson, we recommend starting each day or lesson with a fun warm up activity to get students fired up. Below are instructions for introducing The New York Historical\u2019s preferred warm up game \u2013 Rock, Paper, Scissors Tournament \u2013 but you can choose whatever game or activity you think will work best with your students.\nPart 2: Direct Democracy (20 min)\nWe\u2019re going to start our exploration 2,500 years ago in ancient Athens, which means we must transform our space to get in the spirit. Let\u2019s go!\nNow that we are settled, let\u2019s do a quick review. Does anyone remember where in the world ancient Athens was located? What did the world look like, according to ancient Athenians? What made ancient Athens special? Why are we studying it today?\nSLIDE 8 So how did democracy work in ancient Athens? Ancient Athenians practiced the simplest form of democracy, what we today call direct democracy. Can anyone venture a guess as to what direct democracy means? If we take the literal meaning of the words together, it means \u201cdirect rule by the people.\u201d This means every citizen of ancient Athens could vote on the issues facing the government, and the majority ruled.[1]\nDoes anyone know what it means to vote? It means choosing between two or more options, and having your choice officially counted.[2] So in ancient Athens, the citizens would gather together to make a choice about the issues of the day. The option that most people chose would win. This is what is meant by majority rule. Every citizen directly participated in making government decisions.\nBut remember, we\u2019re talking about 2,500 years ago\u2013a time before tv, newspapers, radio, the internet, and cell phones. How did every citizen know about the issues? How did they learn what they needed to know about the issues in order to form their own opinions? Let\u2019s analyze a painting to find out.\nWho remembers the three steps of inquiry? Let\u2019s start with observation. What do you see in this image?\n[1] The Constitution Society. \u201cDirect Democracy,\u201d accessed July 31, 2024, https://consoc.org.uk/the-constitution-explained/direct-democracy/.\n[2] Merriam-Webster.com Dictionary, s.v. \u201cvote,\u201d accessed January 28, 2025, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vote.\nNow that we have a list of observations, can anyone use those observations to identify what this image is showing us?\nThis is an artist\u2019s rendering of what ancient Athens looked like at its peak. Fun fact: Pericles, who we heard from yesterday, played a central role in building all those buildings you see at the top of the image.[1] But for our purposes today, the most important part of this image is what is happening front and center. In ancient Athens, this space was called an agora. There was an agora in every ancient Greek city, a central place where people could gather to shop, meet, and share news. [2]\nSLIDE 13 Now it is time to make our inferences. Remember, we\u2019re looking at this picture to answer the question of how citizens learned the information they needed to vote in ancient Athens. Based on this image, what do you think? How might the agora be important to democracy in ancient Athens?\nSLIDE 14 The agora was a place where people gathered every day to share news and argue about the issues, the necessary work that comes before casting a vote. Citizens might speak to the crowds in the agora to gather support for their laws or projects. In this image, you can see a small crowd gathered around a speaker.\nSo, in Ancient Athens, people visited the agora every day to do their shopping, hear the news, and gossip with their neighbors. It was a great place for people to hear about the important matters facing the city-state and learn how their neighbors felt about them. This kind of space for information sharing and gathering is critical to a healthy democracy.\nPart 3: Practicing Direct Democracy (35 min)\nSLIDE 15 Now that we have the basics, the best way to understand how this all worked is to just give it a try. It\u2019s time to role play and imagine ourselves as citizens of ancient Athens.\n[1] Mark, Joshua J. \u201cPericles.\u201d In World History Encyclopedia, March 28, 2018, accessed July 12, 2024, https://www.worldhistory.org/pericles/.\n[2] Ancient-Greece.org. \u201cAgora of Athens Archaeological Site,\u201d accessed July 31, 2024, https://ancient-greece.org/archaeology/agora/.\nCitizens! Welcome to the agora! We have a big issue up for a vote. Athens is at war with Sparta, and we need more money to pay the army and navy. To make funds available, the government needs to cut funding to something else. There are two proposals. Some say that we should cut all of our public sports programs.

The website is no longer updated and links to external websites and some internal pages may not work.\n\u201cIt is therefore the policy of my Administration that the Federal Government should pursue a comprehensive approach to advancing equity for all, including people of color and others who have been historically underserved, marginalized, and adversely affected by persistent poverty and inequality. Affirmatively advancing equity, civil rights, racial justice, and equal opportunity is the responsibility of the whole of our Government.\u201d\nOn his first day in office, President Biden signed Executive Order 13985, Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government. The Order recognized that, although the ideal of equal opportunity is the bedrock of American democracy, our laws, public policies, and institutions too often exacerbate disparities or deny equal opportunity to individuals and communities. The President\u2019s Order emphasized the enormous human costs of systemic racism, persistent poverty, and other disparities, and directed the Federal Government to advance an ambitious, whole-of-government equity agenda that matches the scale of the challenges we face as a country and the opportunities we have to build a more perfect union.\nIn recognition that advancing equity is a generational commitment that will require sustained federal leadership and partnership with all communities, President Biden signed Executive Order 14091 on February 16, 2023. The President\u2019s second Executive Order on equity directs the Federal Government to further build equity into the everyday business of government and continue the work to make the promise of America real for everyone, including rural communities, communities of color, Tribal communities, LGBTQI+ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex) individuals, people with disabilities, women and girls, and communities impacted by persistent poverty.\nOver the last three years, the Biden-Harris Administration has championed racial equity and further advanced equal opportunity for underserved communities through landmark legislation including the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act, as well as through historic executive actions. 90 agencies across the Federal Government created and released Equity Action Plans on April 14, 2022 \u2014 first-of-their-kind roadmaps to address the barriers and discrimination that underserved communities face. However, members of underserved communities \u2014 many of whom have endured generations of discrimination and disinvestment \u2014 still confront significant barriers to realizing the full promise of America: persistent poverty and food insecurity; unequal distribution of state and local school aid; inequitable access to clean water and clean air; and exposure to environmental toxins in rural, urban, and Tribal communities, and in U.S. territories; pay inequities that overwhelmingly impact women, people of color, and people with disabilities; poor health outcomes, including disparities in maternal health; and unequal access to loans and bias in the housing appraisal system. The Federal Government has a responsibility to make every effort to remove these barriers and ensure equal opportunity for every person in America.\nIn accordance with Executive Order 14091, federal agencies updated their Equity Action Plans in 2023, to address potential barriers that underserved communities may continue to face in accessing and benefitting from the agency\u2019s policies, programs, and activities, including procurement, contracting, and grant opportunities. The updated Plans include over 100 new commitments and strategies that 23 of the largest federal agencies will undertake in 2024 and beyond, as well as new actions from smaller and independent agencies, to advance racial equity and support for underserved communities under the umbrella of eight whole-of-government equity objectives. These collective efforts are furthering the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s priority of building a more equitable nation. Learn about the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s progress to advance racial equity and support for underserved communities in a new report, which includes a sample of the more than 650 accomplishments since the release of the 2022 Equity Action Plans.\nThe Biden-Harris Administration has a far-reaching equity agenda, which also includes implementing the first-ever national strategy on gender equity and equality; working to ensure the Federal Government is a model for diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in the workforce; delivering environmental justice through the Justice40 Initiative; and advancing LGBTQI+ civil rights. These commitments also reflect attention to the reality that some individuals experience discrimination based on multiple factors.\nThe Administration remains committed to deepening the partnership between government and individuals and communities impacted by discrimination to deliver more equitable outcomes across our nation.\nThe 2023 updates to the federal agency Equity Action Plans include innovative strategies that agencies are using to embed equity in day-to-day governing.\nThe Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s commitment to equity has delivered concrete results for communities that have often been underserved by the Federal Government:\nThe White House 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW Washington, DC 20500\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Free, fair, and accessible elections ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nDemocracy is a core value of the United Nations. The UN supports democracy by promoting human rights, development, and peace and security. In the 79 years since the UN Charter was signed, the UN has done more to support democracy around the world than any other global organization. The UN promotes good governance, monitors elections, supports civil society to strengthen democratic institutions and accountability, ensures self-determination in decolonized countries, and assists in the drafting of new constitutions in post-conflict nations.\nUnited Nations activities in support of democracy are carried out through the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Democracy Fund (UNDEF), the Department of Peace Operations (DPO), the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs (DPPA), the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR),and the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women), among others.\nWhen the founders of the United Nations drafted the United Nations Charter, they did not mention the word democracy. In 1945, many of the UN Member States did not endorse democracy as a system or didn\u2019t practice it. Yet, the opening words of the Charter, \u201cWe the Peoples\u201d, reflect the fundamental principle of democracy - that the will of the people is the source of legitimacy of sovereign states and, therefore, of the United Nations as a whole.\nThe UN does not advocate for a specific model of government but promotes democratic governance as a set of values and principles that should be followed for greater participation, equality, security and human development. Democracy provides an environment that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms, and in which the freely expressed will of people is exercised. People have a say in decisions and can hold decision-makers to account. Women and men have equal rights and all people are free from discrimination\nThese values are embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It projects the concept of democracy by stating \u201cthe will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government\u201d. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights develops them even further and lays down the legal basis for the principles of democracy in international law. It covers, for instance, freedom of expression, the right of peaceful assembly, and the right to freedom of association with others. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women stipulates that its 189 contracting parties shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that women can vote and stand for elections, and participate in public life and decision-making, including at the international level.\nSince 1988, the General Assembly has adopted at least one resolution annually dealing with some aspect of democracy. In 2015, world leaders committed in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to a world in which \u201cdemocracy, good governance and the rule of law as well as an enabling environment at national and international levels, are essential for sustainable development\u201d. The Agenda reaffirmed commitments that were made earlier at the World Summit in 2005 and in the Millennium Declaration.\nThe values of freedom, respect for human rights and the principle of holding periodic and genuine elections by universal suffrage are essential elements of democracy. In turn, democracy provides an environment for the protection and effective realization of human rights.\nFor several years, the UN General Assembly and the former Commission on Human Rights endeavoured to draw on international human rights instruments to promote a common understanding of the principles and values of democracy. As a result, in 2000, the Commission recommended a series of legislative, institutional and practical measures to consolidate democracy. Moreover, in 2002, the Commission declared the following as essential elements of democracy:\nSince its establishment in 2006, the Human Rights Council (successor to the Commission) has adopted several resolutions highlighting the interdependent and mutually reinforcing relationship between democracy and human rights. Recent examples include resolutions 19/36 and 28/14 on \u201cHuman rights, democracy and the rule of law\u201d.\nDemocracy deficits, weak institutions and poor governance impose persistent challenges. The UN Human Rights office (OHCHR) and UNDP address these challenges through their advisory services and programmes. In transitional democracies and countries emerging from conflict, OHCHR assists to build strong and independent judiciary systems, parliaments, human rights institutions, and vibrant civil societies. UNDP helps governments in strengthening their public institutions, to help countries fight corruption and support inclusive participation to ensure that no one is left behind. Every year, UNDP invests, on average, US$565 million to support inclusive governance and development at the local level.\nOHCHR collaborates with national governments and other actors to rebuild public confidence and restore peace and the rule of law in post-conflict nations and transitional democracies. UN Human Rights has actively supported transitional justice programmes in more than 20 countries around the world over the past 15 years. The office tries to ensure that human rights and transitional justice considerations are reflected in peace agreements and it supports the establishment of truth-seeking processes, judicial accountability mechanisms, and reparations programmes.\nOHCHR works to guide national and regional efforts and to facilitate the discussion on democracy and human rights. In 2012, the Human Rights Council adopted a resolution titled \u201cHuman rights, democracy and the rule of law,\u201d which reaffirmed that democracy, development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms were interdependent and mutually reinforcing. Further, OHCHR published a study on challenges, lessons \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Let\u2019s go!\nNow that we are settled, let\u2019s do a quick review. Does anyone remember where in the world ancient Athens was located? What did the world look like, according to ancient Athenians? What made ancient Athens special? Why are we studying it today?\nSLIDE 8 So how did democracy work in ancient Athens? Ancient Athenians practiced the simplest form of democracy, what we today call direct democracy. Can anyone venture a guess as to what direct democracy means? If we take the literal meaning of the words together, it means \u201cdirect rule by the people.\u201d This means every citizen of ancient Athens could vote on the issues facing the government, and the majority ruled.[1]\nDoes anyone know what it means to vote? It means choosing between two or more options, and having your choice officially counted.[2] So in ancient Athens, the citizens would gather together to make a choice about the issues of the day. The option that most people chose would win. This is what is meant by majority rule. Every citizen directly participated in making government decisions.\nBut remember, we\u2019re talking about 2,500 years ago\u2013a time before tv, newspapers, radio, the internet, and cell phones. How did every citizen know about the issues? How did they learn what they needed to know about the issues in order to form their own opinions? Let\u2019s analyze a painting to find out.\nWho remembers the three steps of inquiry? Let\u2019s start with observation.

Fun fact: Pericles, who we heard from yesterday, played a central role in building all those buildings you see at the top of the image.[1] But for our purposes today, the most important part of this image is what is happening front and center. In ancient Athens, this space was called an agora. There was an agora in every ancient Greek city, a central place where people could gather to shop, meet, and share news. [2]\nSLIDE 13 Now it is time to make our inferences. Remember, we\u2019re looking at this picture to answer the question of how citizens learned the information they needed to vote in ancient Athens. Based on this image, what do you think? How might the agora be important to democracy in ancient Athens?\nSLIDE 14 The agora was a place where people gathered every day to share news and argue about the issues, the necessary work that comes before casting a vote. Citizens might speak to the crowds in the agora to gather support for their laws or projects. In this image, you can see a small crowd gathered around a speaker.\nSo, in Ancient Athens, people visited the agora every day to do their shopping, hear the news, and gossip with their neighbors. It was a great place for people to hear about the important matters facing the city-state and learn how their neighbors felt about them. This kind of space for information sharing and gathering is critical to a healthy democracy.\nPart 3: Practicing Direct Democracy (35 min)\nSLIDE 15 Now that we have the basics, the best way to understand how this all worked is to just give it a try.

Political parties often become central to this form of democracy if electoral systems require or encourage voters to vote for political parties or for candidates associated with political parties (as opposed to voting for individual representatives).[4] Some political theorists (including Robert Dahl, Gregory Houston, and Ian Liebenberg) have described representative democracy as polyarchy.[5][6]\nRepresentative democracy can be organized in different ways including both parliamentary and presidential systems of government. Elected representatives typically form a legislature (such as a parliament or congress), which may be composed of a single chamber (unicameral), two chambers (bicameral), or more than two chambers (multicameral). Where two or more chambers exist, their members are often elected in different ways.\nRepresentatives are elected by the public, as in national elections for the national legislature.[2] Elected representatives may hold the power to select other representatives, presidents, or other officers of the government or of the legislature, as the prime minister in the latter case.\nThe power of representatives is usually curtailed by a constitution (as in a constitutional democracy or a constitutional monarchy) or other measures to balance representative power:[7]\nSome political theorists, such as Edmund Burke, believe that part of the duty of a representative is not simply to follow the wishes of the electorate but also to use their own judgment in the exercise of their powers, even if their views are not reflective of those of a majority of voters.[8] A representative who chooses to execute the wishes of their constituents acts as a delegate. If the representative chooses to use their best judgment and knowledge in making decisions, even when the constituents do not fully agree with the decision, then the representative acts as a trustee.\nThe Roman Republic was the first known state in the Western world to have a representative government, despite taking the form of a direct government in the Roman assemblies. The Roman model of governance would inspire many political thinkers over the centuries,[9] and today's modern representative democracies imitate more the Roman than the Greek model, because it was a state in which supreme power was held by the people and their elected representatives, and which had an elected or nominated leader.[10] Representative democracy is a form of democracy in which people vote for representatives who then vote on policy initiatives; as opposed to direct democracy, a form of democracy in which people vote on policy initiatives directly.[11] A European medieval tradition of selecting representatives from the various estates (classes, but not as we know them today) to advise/control monarchs led to relatively wide familiarity with representative systems inspired by Roman systems.\nIn Britain, Simon de Montfort is remembered as one of the fathers of representative government for holding two famous parliaments.[12][13] The first, in 1258, stripped the king of unlimited authority and the second, in 1265, included ordinary citizens from the towns.[14] Later, in the 17th century, the Parliament of England implemented some of the ideas and systems of liberal democracy, culminating in the Glorious Revolution and passage of the Bill of Rights 1689.[15][16] Widening of the voting franchise took place through a series of Reform Acts in the 19th and 20th centuries.\nThe American Revolution led to the creation of a new Constitution of the United States in 1787, with a national legislature based partly on direct elections of representatives every two years, and thus responsible to the electorate for continuance in office.

The idea, however, was not unique to Athens. Other city-states (poleis, sing. polis) also adopted the principle of giving their citizens the right to decide on the issues facing them, but none are as well documented as Athens. So, for most western democracies it is to ancient Athens that they look for inspiring modern government. But how much would we recognise of Athenian democracy?\nThe ancient Greeks were particularly concerned with fundamental questions about who should rule and how? Should sovereignty (kyrion) lie in the rule of law (nomoi), the constitution (politea), officials, or the citizens? Such questions still exercise us today.\nGovernance in the world of the ancient Greeks, or Ell\u00e1s (\u1f19\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03c2; Eng: \u201cHellas\u201d) as they called it [1], took extraordinarily diverse forms and, across different city states and over many centuries, political power could rest in the hands of individuals or in a select few, or in every citizen. Some city-states changed the kind of government from one type to another.\nMonarchy A monarchos (\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2), from the words monos (\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2) meaning \u201cone\u201d, and archos (\u1f04\u03c1\u03c7\u03c9\u03bd) meaning \u201cleader, ruler or chief\u201d, was a single, absolute ruler - a \u201cmonarch\u201d as we would understand the term today.\nIn the Greek world, monarchies were rare and were often only distinguishable from other forms of rule by a single person when the hereditary ruler was more benevolent and ruled in the genuine interest of his people. Famous monarchies included Macedonia and Sparta. although the latter had a system of two kings.\nNot absolute monarchs, the two Spartan kings did, however, hold great power when one or the other led the Spartan army in times of war. In peacetime the kings were kept in check by the ephors (ephoroi) who were themselves elected by the assembly. There were five ephors each of whom held office for just one year. During that time they had power over most areas of civic life and could appoint and check on all the other public officials.\nAristocracy Aristokratia (\u1f00\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1) is formed by two Greek words: aristos (\u1f04\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2) meaning \u201cexcellent\u201d, and kratos (\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2) meaning \u201cpower\u201d. To the ancient Greeks aristokratia, from which we get the word aristocracy, meant \u201crule of the best\u201d qualified citizens. In later times, aristocracy was usually seen as rule by a privileged group of leading families (the aristocratic class).\nOligarchy Oligarkhia (\u1f40\u03bb\u03b9\u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03af\u03b1) is rule by a select group of individuals, sometime small in number, but could include much larger groups. The term derives from the words ol\u00edgos (\u1f40\u03bb\u03af\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2) meaning \u201ca few\u201d and archo (\u1f04\u03c1\u03c7\u03c9) meaning \u201cto rule or to command\u201d. For the ancient Greeks, any system which excluded power from the whole citizen-body and did not involve a single ruler was described as an oligarchy. Oligarchies were perhaps the most common form of city-state government. To name but two, Megara and Thebes were states that had oligarchic governments.\nMuch as with an aristocracy, oligarkhia meant that power usually rested with a small, select group who thought themselves superior in terms of ability or qualities to the rest of a group or society. This meant that control rested with a few rich prominent families who remained in power by passing their influence from one generation to the next.\nTyranny A Tyrannos(\u03c4\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2) was originally one who illegally seized power and controlled a city-state, or polis. Tyrants were sole rulers of a state who had taken power in an unconstitutional manner, often murdering their predecessor. Greek tyrants, however, were not necessarily evil rulers as the word implies today, they simply looked after their own interests.\nThe Greek writers Plato and Aristotle defined a tyrant as \u201cone who rules without law, looks to his own advantage rather than that of his subjects, and uses extreme and cruel tactics - against his own people as well as others\u201d. For Athens, the ultimate tyrants were the Persian kings Darius and Xerses. The demonising of these two \u201cgreat kings\u201d may have been the drivers for demokratia.\nDemocracy Finally we arrive at demokratia (\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1) or \u201crule of the people\u201d where d\u00eamos (\u03b4\u1fc6\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2) means \u201cpeople\u201d and kratos (\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2) means \u201cstrength\u201d or \u201cpower\u201d. Although often credited with the birth of democracy (demokratia), Athens was not the only state to establish this political system: Argos, Syracuse, Rhodes, and Erythrai all had something similar. Regardless, two and a half thousand years ago democracy was a pretty new idea that enabled all eligible citizens to have an equal say in the decisions that affected their lives.\nThe Athenian Assembly The Assembly (ekklesia) of Athens met at least once a month on a small, rocky hill surrounded by parkland with a large flat platform of eroded stone set into its side, and by steps carved on its slope. Known as the Pnyx, the space could accommodate 6,000 citizens (pictured right). The Athenian assembly had four main functions: it made executive pronouncements (decrees, such as deciding to go to war or granting citizenship to a foreigner), elected some officials, legislated, and tried political crimes.\nThe flat stone platform was the bema, the \u201cstepping stone\u201d or speaker\u2019s platform. From the bema any citizen had the right to address the assembly, to debate matters of policy, and have their voice heard. As such, the Pnyx (\u03a0\u03bd\u03cd\u03be, pronounced \u201cpnyks\u201d) embodies the principle of is\u0113gor\u00eda (\u1f30\u03c3\u03b7\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1), or \u201cequal speech\u201d the equal right of every citizen to debate matters of policy. The other two principles of democracy were isonom\u00eda (\u1f30\u03c3\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03af\u03b1), equality under the law, and isopolite\u00eda (\u1f30\u03c3\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1), equality of vote and equal opportunity to assume political office.\nThe right of is\u0113gor\u00eda (equal speech) was expressed by the presiding officer of the Pnyx assembly, who formally began each debate with the open invitation \u201cT\u00eds agore\u00fa\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Political parties often become central to this form of democracy if electoral systems require or encourage voters to vote for political parties or for candidates associated with political parties (as opposed to voting for individual representatives).[4] Some political theorists (including Robert Dahl, Gregory Houston, and Ian Liebenberg) have described representative democracy as polyarchy.[5][6]\nRepresentative democracy can be organized in different ways including both parliamentary and presidential systems of government. Elected representatives typically form a legislature (such as a parliament or congress), which may be composed of a single chamber (unicameral), two chambers (bicameral), or more than two chambers (multicameral). Where two or more chambers exist, their members are often elected in different ways.\nRepresentatives are elected by the public, as in national elections for the national legislature.[2] Elected representatives may hold the power to select other representatives, presidents, or other officers of the government or of the legislature, as the prime minister in the latter case.\nThe power of representatives is usually curtailed by a constitution (as in a constitutional democracy or a constitutional monarchy) or other measures to balance representative power:[7]\nSome political theorists, such as Edmund Burke, believe that part of the duty of a representative is not simply to follow the wishes of the electorate but also to use their own judgment in the exercise of their powers, even if their views are not reflective of those of a majority of voters.[8] A representative who chooses to execute the wishes of their constituents acts as a delegate. If the representative chooses to use their best judgment and knowledge in making decisions, even when the constituents do not fully agree with the decision, then the representative acts as a trustee.\nThe Roman Republic was the first known state in the Western world to have a representative government, despite taking the form of a direct government in the Roman assemblies. The Roman model of governance would inspire many political thinkers over the centuries,[9] and today's modern representative democracies imitate more the Roman than the Greek model, because it was a state in which supreme power was held by the people and their elected representatives, and which had an elected or nominated leader.[10] Representative democracy is a form of democracy in which people vote for representatives who then vote on policy initiatives; as opposed to direct democracy, a form of democracy in which people vote on policy initiatives directly.[11] A European medieval tradition of selecting representatives from the various estates (classes, but not as we know them today) to advise/control monarchs led to relatively wide familiarity with representative systems inspired by Roman systems.\nIn Britain, Simon de Montfort is remembered as one of the fathers of representative government for holding two famous parliaments.[12][13] The first, in 1258, stripped the king of unlimited authority and the second, in 1265, included ordinary citizens from the towns.[14] Later, in the 17th century, the Parliament of England implemented some of the ideas and systems of liberal democracy, culminating in the Glorious Revolution and passage of the Bill of Rights 1689.[15][16] Widening of the voting franchise took place through a series of Reform Acts in the 19th and 20th centuries.\nThe American Revolution led to the creation of a new Constitution of the United States in 1787, with a national legislature based partly on direct elections of representatives every two years, and thus responsible to the electorate for continuance in office.

Democratic self government means that citizens are actively involved in their own governance.\n\nFull Page Content:\nMargaret Stimmann Branson, Associate Director Center for Civic Education\nAppendix\nIn the past decade we have witnessed dramatic demands for freedom on the part of peoples from Asia to Africa and from Central and Eastern Europe to Latin America. And as we have seen one totalitarian or authoritarian regime after another toppled and fledgling democratic governments replace them, we may have become too optimistic about the future of democracy. We also may have become too complacent, too sure of democracy's robustness or of its long term viability. History, however, teaches us that few countries have sustained democratic governments for prolonged periods, a lesson which we as Americans are sometimes inclined to forget. Americans, of course, should take pride and confidence from the fact that they live in the world's oldest constitutional democracy and that the philosophical foundations underlying their political institutions serve as a model for aspiring peoples around the world. The \"shot heard 'round the world\" two centuries ago at the opening of the American Revolution continues to resound today, and it should remind Americans that free institutions are among humanity's highest achievements and worthy of their full energies and earnest devotion to preserve.\nAmericans also should realize that civic education is essential to sustain our constitutional democracy. The habits of the mind, as well as \"habits of the heart,\" the dispositions that inform the democratic ethos, are not inherited. As Alexis de Toqueville pointed out, each new generation is a new people that must acquire the knowledge, learn the skills, and develop the dispositions or traits of private and public character that undergird a constitutional democracy. Those dispositions must be fostered and nurtured by word and study and by the power of example. Democracy is not a \"machine that would go of itself,\" but must be consciously reproduced, one generation after another.\nCivic education, therefore, is-or should be-a prime concern. There is no more important task than the development of an informed, effective, and responsible citizenry.

Borne out of the need to replace the oppressive feudal system put in place by French leaders, it inspired societies across the globe to become more proactive in overturning the status quo of tyrannical regimes. It also forced governments around the world to rethink their governance strategies and adopt more inclusive models that were unlikely to cause upheaval. Ultimately, the French Revolution inspired many of the democratic systems that are prevalent in modern societies today.\nThe French Revolution took place between the years 1789 and 1799. That said, the revolution was not a single event but rather a sequence of events that took place between those years.\nMany of the problems that led to the uprising began in the late 18th century, when France was reeling from economic turbulence. The economic problems were caused partly by the country\u2019s involvement in the American Revolution, which resulted in a heavy financial cost. The economic problems were further compounded by King Louis XVI\u2019s extravagant spending. The worsening economic conditions increased hardships among the working class and forced the Third Estate (made up of commoners) to revolt against the ruling class in order to form its own National Assembly and push for constitutional reforms. And thus, the French Revolution was born.\nEventually, the uprising led to the storming of the Bastille, which was a symbol of royal authority. Soon afterwards, Paris fell from the King\u2019s control. The revolution led to the execution of King Louis XVI and his wife, Marie-Antoinette. Both were executed for treason in 1793.\nThe French Revolution had a significant global impact. This is because it was able to galvanize and, in some instances, divide societies around the world in continents such as Europe and the Americas. For example, it set off the slave revolution in Haiti which resulted in the abolition of slavery in the country in1804. This is after French revolutionaries declared that all men were free and equal. The turn of events caused African slaves in Haiti to rise up. The conflicts it triggered also disrupted existing power structures in countries such as Egypt, India, and parts of Africa.\nEgypt, for example, was conquered by Napoleon Bonaparte after he became a military leader following the French Revolution. With a formidable fleet of more than 300 naval ships, he and his army of over 30,000 soldiers left for Egypt on May 19, 1798 under the orders of the Directory that controlled France. The primary objective was to free Egypt from the oppression of the Ottoman Empire ruling class, while the secondary objective was to block Britain\u2019s route to India.\nDespite initial victories, the French military was eventually defeated by the British army. The invasion by the French marked the beginning of increased interference in the region by major Western powers due to the strategic importance of the Suez Canal.\nThe French Revolution had a domino effect that led to similar uprisings in Europe. Countries such as Belgium and the Netherlands experienced similar uprisings that were partly inspired by French Revolution ideals. At some point, the situation culminated in the secession of Belgium from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands following The Belgian Revolution of 1830. In Ireland, there was the emergence of the 1798 United Irishmen Rebellion which sought to establish a republic based on the French revolutionary principles. However, it was short-lived and ultimately failed. That said, the storming of the Bastille in the French Revolution gave rise to the realization that collective action among the masses could force constitutional reforms.\nFor centuries, France, like many other countries, had been governed by monarchies and autocracies before 1789. The French Revolution changed all this and thus it is commemorated today as a key turning point in history.\nMike is Bachelor of Arts History graduate from the University of Leeds.

And as we have seen one totalitarian or authoritarian regime after another toppled and fledgling democratic governments replace them, we may have become too optimistic about the future of democracy. We also may have become too complacent, too sure of democracy's robustness or of its long term viability. History, however, teaches us that few countries have sustained democratic governments for prolonged periods, a lesson which we as Americans are sometimes inclined to forget. Americans, of course, should take pride and confidence from the fact that they live in the world's oldest constitutional democracy and that the philosophical foundations underlying their political institutions serve as a model for aspiring peoples around the world. The \"shot heard 'round the world\" two centuries ago at the opening of the American Revolution continues to resound today, and it should remind Americans that free institutions are among humanity's highest achievements and worthy of their full energies and earnest devotion to preserve.\nAmericans also should realize that civic education is essential to sustain our constitutional democracy. The habits of the mind, as well as \"habits of the heart,\" the dispositions that inform the democratic ethos, are not inherited. As Alexis de Toqueville pointed out, each new generation is a new people that must acquire the knowledge, learn the skills, and develop the dispositions or traits of private and public character that undergird a constitutional democracy. Those dispositions must be fostered and nurtured by word and study and by the power of example. Democracy is not a \"machine that would go of itself,\" but must be consciously reproduced, one generation after another.\nCivic education, therefore, is-or should be-a prime concern. There is no more important task than the development of an informed, effective, and responsible citizenry. Democracies are sustained by citizens who have the requisite knowledge, skills, and dispositions. Absent a reasoned commitment on the part of its citizens to the fundamental values and principles of democracy, a free and open society cannot succeed. It is imperative, therefore, that educators, policymakers, and members of civil society make the case and ask for the support of civic education from all segments of society and from the widest range of institutions and governments.\nIt is relatively easy for a society to produce technically competent people. But the kind of society Americans want to live in and the kind of government they want to have requires effort and commitment on the part of its citizens. Americans want a society and a government\nMaking that kind of society, that kind of government a reality is the most important challenge Americans face and the most important work they could undertake.\nCivic education in a democratic society most assuredly needs to be concerned with promoting understanding of the ideals of democracy and a reasoned commitment to the values and principles of democracy. That does not mean, however, that democracy should be presented as utopia. Democracy is not utopian, and citizens need to understand that lest they become cynical, apathetic, or simply withdraw from political life when their unrealistic expectations are not met. To be effective civic education must be realistic; it must address the central truths about political life. The American Political Science Association (APSA) recently formed a Task Force on Civic Education. Its statement of purpose calls for more realistic teaching about the nature of political life and a better understanding of \"the complex elements of 'the art of the possible'.\" The APSA report faults existing civic education because all too often it\nCivic Knowledge\nCivic knowledge is concerned with the content or what citizens ought to know; the subject matter, if you will. In both the National Standards and the Civics Framework for the 1998 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), which currently is underway in schools across the United States, the knowledge component is embodied in the form of five significant and enduring questions. These are questions that have continued to engage not only political philosophers and politicians; they are questions that do-or should-engage every thoughtful citizen. The five questions are:\nIt is important that everyone has an opportunity to consider the essential questions about government and civil society that continue to challenge thoughtful people. Addressing the first organizing question \"What are civic life, politics, and government?\" helps citizens make informed judgments about the nature of civic life, politics, and government, and why politics and government are necessary; the purposes of government; the essential characteristics of limited and unlimited government; the nature and purposes of constitutions, and alternative ways of organizing constitutional governments. Consideration of this question should promote greater understanding of the nature and importance of civil society or the complex network of freely formed, voluntary political, social, and economic associations which is an essential component of a constitutional democracy. A vital civil society not only prevents the abuse or excessive concentration of power by government; the organizations of civil society serve as public laboratories in which citizens learn democracy by doing it.\nThe second organizing question \"What are the foundations of the American political system?\" entails an understanding of the historical, philosophical, and economic foundations of the American political system; the distinctive characteristics of American society and political culture; and the values and principles basic to American constitutional\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The definition of \"the people\" and the ways authority is shared ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nParticipate in the 2025 international science photo competition!\nDemocracy (from Ancient Greek: \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1, romanized: d\u0113mokrat\u00eda, from d\u0113mos 'people' and kr\u00e1tos 'rule')[1] is a form of government in which political power is vested in the people or the population of a state.[2][3][4] Under a minimalist definition of democracy, rulers are elected through competitive elections while more expansive or maximalist definitions link democracy to guarantees of civil liberties and human rights in addition to competitive elections.[5][6][4]\nIn a direct democracy, the people have the direct authority to deliberate and decide legislation. In a representative democracy, the people choose governing officials through elections to do so. The definition of \"the people\" and the ways authority is shared among them or delegated by them have changed over time and at varying rates in different countries. Features of democracy often include freedom of assembly, association, personal property, freedom of religion and speech, citizenship, consent of the governed, voting rights, freedom from unwarranted governmental deprivation of the right to life and liberty, and minority rights.\nThe notion of democracy has evolved considerably over time. Throughout history, one can find evidence of direct democracy, in which communities make decisions through popular assembly. Today, the dominant form of democracy is representative democracy, where citizens elect government officials to govern on their behalf such as in a parliamentary or presidential democracy. In the common variant of liberal democracy, the powers of the majority are exercised within the framework of a representative democracy, but a constitution and supreme court limit the majority and protect the minority\u2014usually through securing the enjoyment by all of certain individual rights, such as freedom of speech or freedom of association.[7][8]\nThe term appeared in the 5th century BC in Greek city-states, notably Classical Athens, to mean \"rule of the people\", in contrast to aristocracy (\u1f00\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1, aristokrat\u00eda), meaning \"rule of an elite\".[9] In virtually all democratic governments throughout ancient and modern history, democratic citizenship was initially restricted to an elite class, which was later extended to all adult citizens. In most modern democracies, this was achieved through the suffrage movements of the 19th and 20th centuries.\nDemocracy contrasts with forms of government where power is not vested in the general population of a state, such as authoritarian systems. Historically a rare and vulnerable form of government,[10] democratic systems of government have become more prevalent since the 19th century, in particular with various waves of democratization.[11] Democracy garners considerable legitimacy in the modern world,[12] as public opinion across regions tends to strongly favor democratic systems of government relative to alternatives,[13][14] and as even authoritarian states try to present themselves as democratic.[15][16] Democracy more consistently results in improved health, education and economic outcomes.[17] According to the V-Dem Democracy indices and The Economist Democracy Index, less than half the world's population lives in a democracy as of 2022.[18][19] At the same time, while representative democracy is widely valued, Pew Research Center found that dissatisfaction with democratic performance is common even in many established democracies.[20][21]\nAlthough democracy is generally understood to be defined by voting,[1][8] no consensus exists on a precise definition of democracy.[22] Karl Popper says that the \"classical\" view of democracy is, \"in brief, the theory that democracy is the rule of the people and that the people have a right to rule\".[23] One study identified 2,234 adjectives used to describe democracy in the English language.[24]\nDemocratic principles are reflected in all eligible citizens being equal before the law and having equal access to legislative processes.[25] For example, in a representative democracy, every vote has (in theory) equal weight, and the freedom of eligible citizens is secured by legitimised rights and liberties which are typically enshrined in a constitution,[26][27] while other uses of \"democracy\" may encompass direct democracy, in which citizens vote on issues directly. According to the United Nations, democracy \"provides an environment that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms, and in which the freely expressed will of people is exercised.\"[28]\nOne theory holds that democracy requires three fundamental principles: upward control (sovereignty residing at the lowest levels of authority), political equality, and social norms by which individuals and institutions only consider acceptable acts that reflect the first two principles of upward control and political equality.[29] Legal equality, political freedom and rule of law[30] are often identified by commentators as foundational characteristics for a well-functioning democracy.[22]\nIn some countries, notably in the United Kingdom (which originated the Westminster system), the dominant principle is that of parliamentary sovereignty, while maintaining judicial independence.[31][32] In India, parliamentary sovereignty is subject to the Constitution of India which includes judicial review.[33] Though the term \"democracy\" is typically used in the context of a political state, the principles also are potentially applicable to private organisations, such as clubs, societies and firms.\nDemocracies may use many different decision-making methods, but majority rule is the dominant form. Without compensation, like legal protections of individual or group rights, political minorities can be oppressed by the \"tyranny of the majority\". Majority rule involves a competitive approach, opposed to consensus democracy, creating the need that elections, and generally deliberation, be substantively and procedurally \"fair\", i.e., just and equitable.

The economic problems were caused partly by the country\u2019s involvement in the American Revolution, which resulted in a heavy financial cost. The economic problems were further compounded by King Louis XVI\u2019s extravagant spending. The worsening economic conditions increased hardships among the working class and forced the Third Estate (made up of commoners) to revolt against the ruling class in order to form its own National Assembly and push for constitutional reforms. And thus, the French Revolution was born.\nEventually, the uprising led to the storming of the Bastille, which was a symbol of royal authority.

The turn of events caused African slaves in Haiti to rise up. The conflicts it triggered also disrupted existing power structures in countries such as Egypt, India, and parts of Africa.\nEgypt, for example, was conquered by Napoleon Bonaparte after he became a military leader following the French Revolution. With a formidable fleet of more than 300 naval ships, he and his army of over 30,000 soldiers left for Egypt on May 19, 1798 under the orders of the Directory that controlled France. The primary objective was to free Egypt from the oppression of the Ottoman Empire ruling class, while the secondary objective was to block Britain\u2019s route to India.\nDespite initial victories, the French military was eventually defeated by the British army. The invasion by the French marked the beginning of increased interference in the region by major Western powers due to the strategic importance of the Suez Canal.\nThe French Revolution had a domino effect that led to similar uprisings in Europe. Countries such as Belgium and the Netherlands experienced similar uprisings that were partly inspired by French Revolution ideals. At some point, the situation culminated in the secession of Belgium from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands following The Belgian Revolution of 1830.

The idea, however, was not unique to Athens. Other city-states (poleis, sing. polis) also adopted the principle of giving their citizens the right to decide on the issues facing them, but none are as well documented as Athens. So, for most western democracies it is to ancient Athens that they look for inspiring modern government. But how much would we recognise of Athenian democracy?\nThe ancient Greeks were particularly concerned with fundamental questions about who should rule and how? Should sovereignty (kyrion) lie in the rule of law (nomoi), the constitution (politea), officials, or the citizens? Such questions still exercise us today.\nGovernance in the world of the ancient Greeks, or Ell\u00e1s (\u1f19\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03c2; Eng: \u201cHellas\u201d) as they called it [1], took extraordinarily diverse forms and, across different city states and over many centuries, political power could rest in the hands of individuals or in a select few, or in every citizen. Some city-states changed the kind of government from one type to another.\nMonarchy A monarchos (\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2), from the words monos (\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2) meaning \u201cone\u201d, and archos (\u1f04\u03c1\u03c7\u03c9\u03bd) meaning \u201cleader, ruler or chief\u201d, was a single, absolute ruler - a \u201cmonarch\u201d as we would understand the term today.\nIn the Greek world, monarchies were rare and were often only distinguishable from other forms of rule by a single person when the hereditary ruler was more benevolent and ruled in the genuine interest of his people. Famous monarchies included Macedonia and Sparta. although the latter had a system of two kings.\nNot absolute monarchs, the two Spartan kings did, however, hold great power when one or the other led the Spartan army in times of war. In peacetime the kings were kept in check by the ephors (ephoroi) who were themselves elected by the assembly. There were five ephors each of whom held office for just one year. During that time they had power over most areas of civic life and could appoint and check on all the other public officials.\nAristocracy Aristokratia (\u1f00\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1) is formed by two Greek words: aristos (\u1f04\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2) meaning \u201cexcellent\u201d, and kratos (\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2) meaning \u201cpower\u201d. To the ancient Greeks aristokratia, from which we get the word aristocracy, meant \u201crule of the best\u201d qualified citizens. In later times, aristocracy was usually seen as rule by a privileged group of leading families (the aristocratic class).\nOligarchy Oligarkhia (\u1f40\u03bb\u03b9\u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03af\u03b1) is rule by a select group of individuals, sometime small in number, but could include much larger groups. The term derives from the words ol\u00edgos (\u1f40\u03bb\u03af\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2) meaning \u201ca few\u201d and archo (\u1f04\u03c1\u03c7\u03c9) meaning \u201cto rule or to command\u201d. For the ancient Greeks, any system which excluded power from the whole citizen-body and did not involve a single ruler was described as an oligarchy. Oligarchies were perhaps the most common form of city-state government. To name but two, Megara and Thebes were states that had oligarchic governments.\nMuch as with an aristocracy, oligarkhia meant that power usually rested with a small, select group who thought themselves superior in terms of ability or qualities to the rest of a group or society. This meant that control rested with a few rich prominent families who remained in power by passing their influence from one generation to the next.\nTyranny A Tyrannos(\u03c4\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2) was originally one who illegally seized power and controlled a city-state, or polis. Tyrants were sole rulers of a state who had taken power in an unconstitutional manner, often murdering their predecessor. Greek tyrants, however, were not necessarily evil rulers as the word implies today, they simply looked after their own interests.\nThe Greek writers Plato and Aristotle defined a tyrant as \u201cone who rules without law, looks to his own advantage rather than that of his subjects, and uses extreme and cruel tactics - against his own people as well as others\u201d. For Athens, the ultimate tyrants were the Persian kings Darius and Xerses. The demonising of these two \u201cgreat kings\u201d may have been the drivers for demokratia.\nDemocracy Finally we arrive at demokratia (\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1) or \u201crule of the people\u201d where d\u00eamos (\u03b4\u1fc6\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2) means \u201cpeople\u201d and kratos (\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2) means \u201cstrength\u201d or \u201cpower\u201d. Although often credited with the birth of democracy (demokratia), Athens was not the only state to establish this political system: Argos, Syracuse, Rhodes, and Erythrai all had something similar. Regardless, two and a half thousand years ago democracy was a pretty new idea that enabled all eligible citizens to have an equal say in the decisions that affected their lives.\nThe Athenian Assembly The Assembly (ekklesia) of Athens met at least once a month on a small, rocky hill surrounded by parkland with a large flat platform of eroded stone set into its side, and by steps carved on its slope. Known as the Pnyx, the space could accommodate 6,000 citizens (pictured right). The Athenian assembly had four main functions: it made executive pronouncements (decrees, such as deciding to go to war or granting citizenship to a foreigner), elected some officials, legislated, and tried political crimes.\nThe flat stone platform was the bema, the \u201cstepping stone\u201d or speaker\u2019s platform. From the bema any citizen had the right to address the assembly, to debate matters of policy, and have their voice heard.

Borne out of the need to replace the oppressive feudal system put in place by French leaders, it inspired societies across the globe to become more proactive in overturning the status quo of tyrannical regimes. It also forced governments around the world to rethink their governance strategies and adopt more inclusive models that were unlikely to cause upheaval. Ultimately, the French Revolution inspired many of the democratic systems that are prevalent in modern societies today.\nThe French Revolution took place between the years 1789 and 1799. That said, the revolution was not a single event but rather a sequence of events that took place between those years.\nMany of the problems that led to the uprising began in the late 18th century, when France was reeling from economic turbulence. The economic problems were caused partly by the country\u2019s involvement in the American Revolution, which resulted in a heavy financial cost. The economic problems were further compounded by King Louis XVI\u2019s extravagant spending. The worsening economic conditions increased hardships among the working class and forced the Third Estate (made up of commoners) to revolt against the ruling class in order to form its own National Assembly and push for constitutional reforms. And thus, the French Revolution was born.\nEventually, the uprising led to the storming of the Bastille, which was a symbol of royal authority. Soon afterwards, Paris fell from the King\u2019s control. The revolution led to the execution of King Louis XVI and his wife, Marie-Antoinette. Both were executed for treason in 1793.\nThe French Revolution had a significant global impact. This is because it was able to galvanize and, in some instances, divide societies around the world in continents such as Europe and the Americas. For example, it set off the slave revolution in Haiti which resulted in the abolition of slavery in the country in1804. This is after French revolutionaries declared that all men were free and equal. The turn of events caused African slaves in Haiti to rise up. The conflicts it triggered also disrupted existing power structures in countries such as Egypt, India, and parts of Africa.\nEgypt, for example, was conquered by Napoleon Bonaparte after he became a military leader following the French Revolution. With a formidable fleet of more than 300 naval ships, he and his army of over 30,000 soldiers left for Egypt on May 19, 1798 under the orders of the Directory that controlled France. The primary objective was to free Egypt from the oppression of the Ottoman Empire ruling class, while the secondary objective was to block Britain\u2019s route to India.\nDespite initial victories, the French military was eventually defeated by the British army. The invasion by the French marked the beginning of increased interference in the region by major Western powers due to the strategic importance of the Suez Canal.\nThe French Revolution had a domino effect that led to similar uprisings in Europe. Countries such as Belgium and the Netherlands experienced similar uprisings that were partly inspired by French Revolution ideals. At some point, the situation culminated in the secession of Belgium from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands following The Belgian Revolution of 1830. In Ireland, there was the emergence of the 1798 United Irishmen Rebellion which sought to establish a republic based on the French revolutionary principles. However, it was short-lived and ultimately failed. That said, the storming of the Bastille in the French Revolution gave rise to the realization that collective action among the masses could force constitutional reforms.\nFor centuries, France, like many other countries, had been governed by monarchies and autocracies before 1789. The French Revolution changed all this and thus it is commemorated today as a key turning point in history.\nMike is Bachelor of Arts History graduate from the University of Leeds.

Political parties often become central to this form of democracy if electoral systems require or encourage voters to vote for political parties or for candidates associated with political parties (as opposed to voting for individual representatives).[4] Some political theorists (including Robert Dahl, Gregory Houston, and Ian Liebenberg) have described representative democracy as polyarchy.[5][6]\nRepresentative democracy can be organized in different ways including both parliamentary and presidential systems of government. Elected representatives typically form a legislature (such as a parliament or congress), which may be composed of a single chamber (unicameral), two chambers (bicameral), or more than two chambers (multicameral). Where two or more chambers exist, their members are often elected in different ways.\nRepresentatives are elected by the public, as in national elections for the national legislature.[2] Elected representatives may hold the power to select other representatives, presidents, or other officers of the government or of the legislature, as the prime minister in the latter case.\nThe power of representatives is usually curtailed by a constitution (as in a constitutional democracy or a constitutional monarchy) or other measures to balance representative power:[7]\nSome political theorists, such as Edmund Burke, believe that part of the duty of a representative is not simply to follow the wishes of the electorate but also to use their own judgment in the exercise of their powers, even if their views are not reflective of those of a majority of voters.[8] A representative who chooses to execute the wishes of their constituents acts as a delegate. If the representative chooses to use their best judgment and knowledge in making decisions, even when the constituents do not fully agree with the decision, then the representative acts as a trustee.\nThe Roman Republic was the first known state in the Western world to have a representative government, despite taking the form of a direct government in the Roman assemblies. The Roman model of governance would inspire many political thinkers over the centuries,[9] and today's modern representative democracies imitate more the Roman than the Greek model, because it was a state in which supreme power was held by the people and their elected representatives, and which had an elected or nominated leader.[10] Representative democracy is a form of democracy in which people vote for representatives who then vote on policy initiatives; as opposed to direct democracy, a form of democracy in which people vote on policy initiatives directly.[11] A European medieval tradition of selecting representatives from the various estates (classes, but not as we know them today) to advise/control monarchs led to relatively wide familiarity with representative systems inspired by Roman systems.\nIn Britain, Simon de Montfort is remembered as one of the fathers of representative government for holding two famous parliaments.[12][13] The first, in 1258, stripped the king of unlimited authority and the second, in 1265, included ordinary citizens from the towns.[14] Later, in the 17th century, the Parliament of England implemented some of the ideas and systems of liberal democracy, culminating in the Glorious Revolution and passage of the Bill of Rights 1689.[15][16] Widening of the voting franchise took place through a series of Reform Acts in the 19th and 20th centuries.\nThe American Revolution led to the creation of a new Constitution of the United States in 1787, with a national legislature based partly on direct elections of representatives every two years, and thus responsible to the electorate for continuance in office. Senators were not directly elected by the people until the adoption of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913. Women, men who owned no property, and Black people, and others not originally given voting rights, in most states eventually gained the vote through changes in state and federal law in the course of the 19th and 20th centuries. Until it was repealed by the Fourteenth Amendment following the Civil War, the Three-Fifths Compromise gave a disproportionate representation of slave states in the House of Representatives relative to the voters in free states.[17][18]\nIn 1789, Revolutionary France adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and, although short-lived, the National Convention was elected by all males in 1792.[19] Universal male suffrage was re-established in France in the wake of the French Revolution of 1848.[20]\nRepresentative democracy came into general favour particularly in post-industrial revolution nation states where large numbers of citizens evinced interest in politics, but where technology and population figures remained unsuited to direct democracy.[citation needed] Many historians credit the Reform Act 1832 with launching modern representative democracy in the United Kingdom.[21][22]\nGlobally, a majority of governments in the world are representative democracies, including constitutiona\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

In a representative democracy, the people choose governing officials through elections to do so. The definition of \"the people\" and the ways authority is shared among them or delegated by them have changed over time and at varying rates in different countries. Features of democracy often include freedom of assembly, association, personal property, freedom of religion and speech, citizenship, consent of the governed, voting rights, freedom from unwarranted governmental deprivation of the right to life and liberty, and minority rights.\nThe notion of democracy has evolved considerably over time. Throughout history, one can find evidence of direct democracy, in which communities make decisions through popular assembly. Today, the dominant form of democracy is representative democracy, where citizens elect government officials to govern on their behalf such as in a parliamentary or presidential democracy. In the common variant of liberal democracy, the powers of the majority are exercised within the framework of a representative democracy, but a constitution and supreme court limit the majority and protect the minority\u2014usually through securing the enjoyment by all of certain individual rights, such as freedom of speech or freedom of association.[7][8]\nThe term appeared in the 5th century BC in Greek city-states, notably Classical Athens, to mean \"rule of the people\", in contrast to aristocracy (\u1f00\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1, aristokrat\u00eda), meaning \"rule of an elite\".[9] In virtually all democratic governments throughout ancient and modern history, democratic citizenship was initially restricted to an elite class, which was later extended to all adult citizens. In most modern democracies, this was achieved through the suffrage movements of the 19th and 20th centuries.\nDemocracy contrasts with forms of government where power is not vested in the general population of a state, such as authoritarian systems. Historically a rare and vulnerable form of government,[10] democratic systems of government have become more prevalent since the 19th century, in particular with various waves of democratization.[11] Democracy garners considerable legitimacy in the modern world,[12] as public opinion across regions tends to strongly favor democratic systems of government relative to alternatives,[13][14] and as even authoritarian states try to present themselves as democratic.[15][16] Democracy more consistently results in improved health, education and economic outcomes.[17] According to the V-Dem Democracy indices and The Economist Democracy Index, less than half the world's population lives in a democracy as of 2022.[18][19] At the same time, while representative democracy is widely valued, Pew Research Center found that dissatisfaction with democratic performance is common even in many established democracies.[20][21]\nAlthough democracy is generally understood to be defined by voting,[1][8] no consensus exists on a precise definition of democracy.[22] Karl Popper says that the \"classical\" view of democracy is, \"in brief, the theory that democracy is the rule of the people and that the people have a right to rule\".[23] One study identified 2,234 adjectives used to describe democracy in the English language.[24]\nDemocratic principles are reflected in all eligible citizens being equal before the law and having equal access to legislative processes.[25] For example, in a representative democracy, every vote has (in theory) equal weight, and the freedom of eligible citizens is secured by legitimised rights and liberties which are typically enshrined in a constitution,[26][27] while other uses of \"democracy\" may encompass direct democracy, in which citizens vote on issues directly. According to the United Nations, democracy \"provides an environment that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms, and in which the freely expressed will of people is exercised.\"[28]\nOne theory holds that democracy requires three fundamental principles: upward control (sovereignty residing at the lowest levels of authority), political equality, and social norms by which individuals and institutions only consider acceptable acts that reflect the first two principles of upward control and political equality.[29] Legal equality, political freedom and rule of law[30] are often identified by commentators as foundational characteristics for a well-functioning democracy.[22]\nIn some countries, notably in the United Kingdom (which originated the Westminster system), the dominant principle is that of parliamentary sovereignty, while maintaining judicial independence.[31][32] In India, parliamentary sovereignty is subject to the Constitution of India which includes judicial review.[33] Though the term \"democracy\" is typically used in the context of a political state, the principles also are potentially applicable to private organisations, such as clubs, societies and firms.\nDemocracies may use many different decision-making methods, but majority rule is the dominant form. Without compensation, like legal protections of individual or group rights, political minorities can be oppressed by the \"tyranny of the majority\". Majority rule involves a competitive approach, opposed to consensus democracy, creating the need that elections, and generally deliberation, be substantively and procedurally \"fair\", i.e., just and equitable.

In a representative democracy, the people choose governing officials through elections to do so. The definition of \"the people\" and the ways authority is shared among them or delegated by them have changed over time and at varying rates in different countries. Features of democracy often include freedom of assembly, association, personal property, freedom of religion and speech, citizenship, consent of the governed, voting rights, freedom from unwarranted governmental deprivation of the right to life and liberty, and minority rights.\nThe notion of democracy has evolved considerably over time. Throughout history, one can find evidence of direct democracy, in which communities make decisions through popular assembly. Today, the dominant form of democracy is representative democracy, where citizens elect government officials to govern on their behalf such as in a parliamentary or presidential democracy. In the common variant of liberal democracy, the powers of the majority are exercised within the framework of a representative democracy, but a constitution and supreme court limit the majority and protect the minority\u2014usually through securing the enjoyment by all of certain individual rights, such as freedom of speech or freedom of association.[7][8]\nThe term appeared in the 5th century BC in Greek city-states, notably Classical Athens, to mean \"rule of the people\", in contrast to aristocracy (\u1f00\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1, aristokrat\u00eda), meaning \"rule of an elite\".[9] In virtually all democratic governments throughout ancient and modern history, democratic citizenship was initially restricted to an elite class, which was later extended to all adult citizens. In most modern democracies, this was achieved through the suffrage movements of the 19th and 20th centuries.\nDemocracy contrasts with forms of government where power is not vested in the general population of a state, such as authoritarian systems. Historically a rare and vulnerable form of government,[10] democratic systems of government have become more prevalent since the 19th century, in particular with various waves of democratization.[11] Democracy garners considerable legitimacy in the modern world,[12] as public opinion across regions tends to strongly favor democratic systems of government relative to alternatives,[13][14] and as even authoritarian states try to present themselves as democratic.[15][16] Democracy more consistently results in improved health, education and economic outcomes.[17] According to the V-Dem Democracy indices and The Economist Democracy Index, less than half the world's population lives in a democracy as of 2022.[18][19] At the same time, while representative democracy is widely valued, Pew Research Center found that dissatisfaction with democratic performance is common even in many established democracies.[20][21]\nAlthough democracy is generally understood to be defined by voting,[1][8] no consensus exists on a precise definition of democracy.[22] Karl Popper says that the \"classical\" view of democracy is, \"in brief, the theory that democracy is the rule of the people and that the people have a right to rule\".[23] One study identified 2,234 adjectives used to describe democracy in the English language.[24]\nDemocratic principles are reflected in all eligible citizens being equal before the law and having equal access to legislative processes.[25] For example, in a representative democracy, every vote has (in theory) equal weight, and the freedom of eligible citizens is secured by legitimised rights and liberties which are typically enshrined in a constitution,[26][27] while other uses of \"democracy\" may encompass direct democracy, in which citizens vote on issues directly. According to the United Nations, democracy \"provides an environment that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms, and in which the freely expressed will of people is exercised.\"[28]\nOne theory holds that democracy requires three fundamental principles: upward control (sovereignty residing at the lowest levels of authority), political equality, and social norms by which individuals and institutions only consider acceptable acts that reflect the first two principles of upward control and political equality.[29] Legal equality, political freedom and rule of law[30] are often identified by commentators as foundational characteristics for a well-functioning democracy.[22]\nIn some countries, notably in the United Kingdom (which originated the Westminster system), the dominant principle is that of parliamentary sovereignty, while maintaining judicial independence.[31][32] In India, parliamentary sovereignty is subject to the Constitution of India which includes judicial review.[33] Though the term \"democracy\" is typically used in the context of a political state, the principles also are potentially applicable to private organisations, such as clubs, societies and firms.\nDemocracies may use many different decision-making methods, but majority rule is the dominant form. Without compensation, like legal protections of individual or group rights, political minorities can be oppressed by the \"tyranny of the majority\". Majority rule involves a competitive approach, opposed to consensus democracy, creating the need that elections, and generally deliberation, be substantively and procedurally \"fair\", i.e., just and equitable.

Political parties often become central to this form of democracy if electoral systems require or encourage voters to vote for political parties or for candidates associated with political parties (as opposed to voting for individual representatives).[4] Some political theorists (including Robert Dahl, Gregory Houston, and Ian Liebenberg) have described representative democracy as polyarchy.[5][6]\nRepresentative democracy can be organized in different ways including both parliamentary and presidential systems of government. Elected representatives typically form a legislature (such as a parliament or congress), which may be composed of a single chamber (unicameral), two chambers (bicameral), or more than two chambers (multicameral). Where two or more chambers exist, their members are often elected in different ways.\nRepresentatives are elected by the public, as in national elections for the national legislature.[2] Elected representatives may hold the power to select other representatives, presidents, or other officers of the government or of the legislature, as the prime minister in the latter case.\nThe power of representatives is usually curtailed by a constitution (as in a constitutional democracy or a constitutional monarchy) or other measures to balance representative power:[7]\nSome political theorists, such as Edmund Burke, believe that part of the duty of a representative is not simply to follow the wishes of the electorate but also to use their own judgment in the exercise of their powers, even if their views are not reflective of those of a majority of voters.[8] A representative who chooses to execute the wishes of their constituents acts as a delegate. If the representative chooses to use their best judgment and knowledge in making decisions, even when the constituents do not fully agree with the decision, then the representative acts as a trustee.\nThe Roman Republic was the first known state in the Western world to have a representative government, despite taking the form of a direct government in the Roman assemblies. The Roman model of governance would inspire many political thinkers over the centuries,[9] and today's modern representative democracies imitate more the Roman than the Greek model, because it was a state in which supreme power was held by the people and their elected representatives, and which had an elected or nominated leader.[10] Representative democracy is a form of democracy in which people vote for representatives who then vote on policy initiatives; as opposed to direct democracy, a form of democracy in which people vote on policy initiatives directly.[11] A European medieval tradition of selecting representatives from the various estates (classes, but not as we know them today) to advise/control monarchs led to relatively wide familiarity with representative systems inspired by Roman systems.\nIn Britain, Simon de Montfort is remembered as one of the fathers of representative government for holding two famous parliaments.[12][13] The first, in 1258, stripped the king of unlimited authority and the second, in 1265, included ordinary citizens from the towns.[14] Later, in the 17th century, the Parliament of England implemented some of the ideas and systems of liberal democracy, culminating in the Glorious Revolution and passage of the Bill of Rights 1689.[15][16] Widening of the voting franchise took place through a series of Reform Acts in the 19th and 20th centuries.\nThe American Revolution led to the creation of a new Constitution of the United States in 1787, with a national legislature based partly on direct elections of representatives every two years, and thus responsible to the electorate for continuance in office. Senators were not directly elected by the people until the adoption of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913. Women, men who owned no property, and Black people, and others not originally given voting rights, in most states eventually gained the vote through changes in state and federal law in the course of the 19th and 20th centuries.
