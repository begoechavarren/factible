Antioxidant drinks offer a practical way to combat them. They deliver essential compounds derived from fruits, vegetables, and herbs.\nWhile juices, smoothies, and concentrated shots contribute to antioxidant intake, their efficacy depends on ingredient selection and preparation. You can take a targeted approach with your antioxidant intake to improve health and fight medical conditions.\nAt Hurom, we're dedicated to empowering everyone to maximize their nutritional intake. We\u2019ll share some easy and delicious recipes for antioxidant-rich drinks, so keep reading below!\nAntioxidants are substances (specifically molecules) that fight free radicals in the body and prevent cellular damage.\nFree radicals are unstable molecules in your body, which are produced naturally or as a result of environmental factors like smoke or radiation. These free radicals stabilize themselves by reacting with healthy cells in your body and damaging them. This is called oxidation. That\u2019s why they\u2019re associated with illnesses like diabetes, cancer, and heart disease.\nHowever, antioxidants prevent free radicals from doing what they do, i.e., oxidation\u2014hence the name. Vegetables, fruits, and whole grains are naturally antioxidant-rich foods. Even some vitamins like C and E have antioxidant properties.\nThere are many types of antioxidants, and they work in different ways on the body. Some may have specific benefits like protecting particular systems and organs.\nThat brings us to the next point:\nA well-balanced diet with fruits and vegetables can give you enough antioxidants daily. While their main job is preventing cell damage, that work translates into many health benefits:\nLower the risk of disease: Antioxidants can lower the risk of certain life-threatening diseases caused by oxidative stress. Some people are more prone to such illnesses than others, due to genetics or lifestyle choices. As such, making better lifestyle choices can help.\nAnti-aging effect: Cellular damage from oxidative stress is often responsible for cognitive and physical aging in humans\u2014poor memory, loose skin, hair loss, etc. Antioxidants slow down the effects of aging by balancing the free radicals.\nImprove eye health: Certain compounds, like lutein and zeaxanthin, are crucial for maintaining healthy vision and may help prevent age-related macular degeneration and cataracts.\nSlows cognitive decline: These chemicals can protect brain cells from oxidative damage, potentially reducing the risk of cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's.\nJuices can preserve the antioxidants in the ingredients, depending on the process of juicing and storage temperature.\nJuicing provides a quick and easy way to get beneficial antioxidants. If you mix different fruits and veggies with a high antioxidant power, you can benefit from more different compounds. However, the content and activity of the substances may decrease due to the juicing process and environmental factors.\nThere\u2019s strong evidence that heat impacts the antioxidants found in fruits, vegetables, and herbs. Traditional juicers that use the centrifugal method tend to produce heat, which can destroy some nutrients, particularly flavonoids and polyphenols.\nSlow or masticating juicers, on the other hand, don\u2019t involve any heating, so they\u2019re able to preserve the antioxidants in each glass of juice.\nStorage also affects the activity and quality of the antioxidants. If you don\u2019t consume the juice when it\u2019s made, refrigerate it to ensure the nutrients aren\u2019t damaged. Cold-pressed juice can last up to three days in the fridge. After this time, the antioxidant activity may start to reduce and the juice will begin to go bad. Basically, you should not consume the juice after 72 hours if it hasn't been pasteurized.\nHurom\u2019s slow juicers help preserve all the nutrients in fruits and vegetables, so you get all the antioxidants they contain. The slow-moving auger in our juicers doesn\u2019t produce any heat, which helps preserve the temperature-sensitive antioxidants like vitamins and polyphenols.\nAs such, you can notice the effects faster.\nBut what are the best antioxidant drinks? That leads us to the following section.\nThe good news is that there are many antioxidant drinks to choose from, mainly juices, that can provide you with various health benefits. Here are all the antioxidant-rich juices, smoothies, teas, and other drinks you should try to incorporate in your diet.\nJuices are your best option if you want to get a fast influx of antioxidants because they\u2019re easy to digest. Of course, you\u2019ll need a high-quality juicer to keep all the nutrients intact.\n1. Super Antioxidant Juice (Booster for Health)\nThis juice uses beetroot, orange, carrots, and apples, with ginger (which has been used for medical and health benefits for centuries).\nBeetroot contains betalains, powerful antioxidants that help detoxify the liver and reduce inflammation. Oranges are rich in vitamin C, which boosts the immune function. Apples provide quercetin, a flavonoid that supports cardiovascular health and reduces inflammation.

Below is a practical, evidence-based timeline and storage guidance to preserve maximum nutrition.\nKey principles\nKnow your juicer, different types produce juices with varying amounts of nutrient loss from the juicing process itself. Juicers start the degradation of nutrients through heat and oxidation from foam.\nHigh-speed Masticating Juicers produce too much heat so you must drink the juice immediately before the nutrients totally degrade\nCentrifugal Juicers create oxidation that degrades nutrients, so you should also drink the juice immediately before the nutrients totally degrade.\nSlow-speed Masticating Juicers produce less heat and oxidation so you can refrigerate juices for up to one day..\nHydraulic Pre\nWhat is a good IQ score, and how do you know where you stand?\nIQ, or Intelligence Quotient, is often misunderstood. Many people think it\u2019s just a number\u2014but it\u2019s actually a snapshot of how your brain processes information, solves problems, reasons logically, and recognizes patterns. Understanding your IQ can give you valuable insight into your cognitive strengths\u2014and help you figure out where you stand compared to others.\n\ud83d\udc49 Take the official IQ test here: Start IQ Test | eFAQ\nWhat Does an IQ Score Actually Mean?\nIQ scores are standardized so that the average score is 100. Most people score betwee\nMacro nutrients are harder to degrade or at least it take a much longer time. However, the same cannot be said for micro nutrients i.e vitamins. The moment, vegetables or fruits are being cut and expose to air the vitamins will be degraded very quickly due to oxidation. Freezing or heating fruits or vegetables will further accelerate the rate of degration. So it is best to consume fresh juice immediately upon making them.\nOxidation is immediate\u2026.. the real question prehs is how and under what conditions can one best preserve fresh organic juices?\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",
