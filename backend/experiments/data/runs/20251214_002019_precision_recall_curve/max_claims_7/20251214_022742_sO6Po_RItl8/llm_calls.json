    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nIt's my feelgood breakfast show. A feel good breakfast show. This is Espresso. Thank you so much for joining us on our live show this morning. Now before the break, I said health properties and there might be something in it for all of us when we talk about garlic. Now aside from the fact that it tastes incredible. We all know that garlic has both culinary and medical benefits. But scientists at the UC tea uh they say that they've uncovered garlic's cancer fighting properties. So in this new research UCT lecturer Dr. Katherine Kushula and her team, they've established how a compound, a compound found in crushed garlic cloves can actually kill cancer cells. And with us in studio to talk about it is Dr. Kula herself. Dr. Welcome to the show. Hi, lovely to be here. I'm excited about this because we're saying cancer killing properties from a compound that's found in crushed garlic cloves. Now, I want to get down to this. Why it needs to be crushed? Does it need to be heated? How effective is it in killing cancer? I mean what what are we talking about here? Well, the thing is I suppose because we are scientists and we're coming from the chemistry department, we actually want to understand what the compounds are that are present in garlic that are having this effect. And in actual fact, when the clove is first crushed, there's a compound allisonin which is released which is more antibacterial properties. But this compound actually changes over time when the preparation is heated as in a food preparation into this cancer fighting compound called auine. And it's got dulfide bonds in it, which means it also has this potent garlic smell. And we've actually shown that auine is able to enter into the cancer cell and it's actually able to disrupt the intracellular machinery in the cancer cell and bring about a toxic effect and kill that cancer cell. I'm gobsmacked that we're going back to natural remedies. I mean, you guys are scientists. We expect you to work with chemicals and all kinds of crazy stuff, but here we're talking about stuff that's in our kitchen cupboards. Can this property or auine like you you mentioned can it fight any type of cancer or is it only effective in some? Well, it's been shown to be cytotoxic to a range of different types of cancers. Although I think what's more relevant to the human condition because it's a dietary compound and there's a lot of epidemiological um evidence to show that actually populations of people who consume high quantities of garlic have lower incidence of gastrointestinal cancer specifically of the stomach and colon. So um I would think that you know you would probably obtain the highest concentration of this compound through a meal which has been prepared with the akawine in it. In other words, being cooked and probably exposure to um you know, oral exposure to gastrointestinal cancers would probably have a greater effect. Although we have shown in the laboratory that it is also able um to act against other cancer cell types, but I think for the human condition, it's probably more gastrointestinal tract. It's exciting because now that means we can add more garlic to our food because you're saying that we need to do it while cooking. This is also the first time that you see this because like you said, scientists wants to see how the auin or how the garlic properties actually work. What's the best way to try and consume it? I mean, take us back there. Should it always be crushed or cooked? Yes. Well, if you want to get this cancer fighting chemical, and I say it's a chemical, it's a natural compound, but it is still a chemical, and it's present in your garlic. You actually need to take your crushed clove and actually you need to take your clove, crush it, and then in order to achieve um this transformation of what's in the crushed clove into what's what's going to be present in your food preparation, you actually need to heat the preparation and you actually get a chemical transformation which takes place between a compound which is produced in the crush clove and then it gets transformed through heating into this aching compound. So um the the preparation would involve cooking of the clove which I think is actually a process which we do do when we prepare. So possibly we knew about this in some way. I don't know in some way or another doctor it's exciting stuff and it's exciting that even scientists are coming back to our kitchen to show us how to prepare things and to make things better. So thank you so much for joining us on our show today. Well there you heard it an excuse to add more garlic to that pizza. It's really good news. So make sure you try some on your next dinner date especially if you know him for the first time. Okay, but there's loads more happening on our feelood breakfast show. In fact, even though it can leave a smile the next day, we all know that garlic is so good for us. And it looks like Andrea has more details on this.",

Allicin is ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAllicin is an organosulfur compound obtained from garlic and leeks.[1] When fresh garlic is chopped or crushed, the enzyme alliinase converts alliin into allicin, which is responsible for the aroma of fresh garlic.[2] Allicin is unstable and quickly changes into a series of other sulfur-containing compounds such as diallyl disulfide.[3] Allicin is an antifeedant, i.e. the defense mechanism against attacks by pests on the garlic plant.[4]\nAllicin is an oily, slightly yellow liquid that gives garlic its distinctive odor. It is a thioester of a sulfinic acid. It is also known as allyl thiosulfinate.[5] Its biological activity can be attributed to both its antioxidant activity and its reaction with thiol-containing proteins.[6]\nAllicin features the thiosulfinate functional group, R-S-(O)-S-R. The compound is not present in garlic unless tissue damage occurs,[1] and is formed by the action of the enzyme alliinase on alliin.[1] Allicin is chiral but occurs naturally only as a racemate.[7] The racemic form can also be generated by oxidation of diallyl disulfide:[8][9]\nAlliinase is irreversibly deactivated below pH 3; as such, allicin is generally not produced in the body from the consumption of fresh or powdered garlic.[10][11] Furthermore, allicin can be unstable, breaking down within 16 hours at 23 \u00b0C.[12]\nThe biosynthesis of allicin commences with the conversion of cysteine into S-allyl-L-cysteine. Oxidation of this thioether gives the sulfoxide (alliin). The enzyme alliinase, which contains pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), cleaves alliin, generating allylsulfenic acid (CH2=CHCH2SOH), pyruvate, and ammonium ions.[6] At room temperature, two molecules of allylsulfenic acid condense to form allicin.[5][9]\nAllicin has been studied for its potential to treat various kinds of multiple drug resistance bacterial infections, as well as viral and fungal infections in vitro, but as of 2016, the safety and efficacy of allicin to treat infections in people was unclear.[13]\nA Cochrane review found there to be insufficient clinical evidence regarding the effects of allicin in preventing or treating common cold.[14]\nIt was first isolated and studied in the laboratory by Chester J. Cavallito and John Hays Bailey in 1944.[15][7] Allicin was discovered as part of efforts to create thiamine derivatives in the 1940s, mainly in Japan. Allicin became a model for medicinal chemistry efforts to create other thiamine disulfides. The results included sulbutiamine, fursultiamine (thiamine tetrahydrofurfuryl disulfide) and benfothiamine. These compounds are hydrophobic, easily pass from the intestines to the bloodstream, and are reduced to thiamine by cysteine or glutathione.[16]: 302\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Garlic and its secondary metabolites have shown excellent health-promoting and disease-preventing effects on many human common diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, blood pressure, and diabetes, through its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and lipid-lowering properties, as demonstrated in several in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies. The present review aims to provide a comprehensive overview on the consumption of garlic, garlic preparation, garlic extract, and garlic extract-derived bioactive constituents on oxidative stress, inflammation, cancer, cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, skin, bone, and other common diseases. Among the 83 human interventional trials considered, the consumption of garlic has been reported to modulate multiple biomarkers of different diseases; in addition, its combination with drugs or other food matrices has been shown to be safe and to prolong their therapeutic effects. The rapid metabolism and poor bioavailability that have limited the therapeutic use of garlic in the last years are also discussed.\nKeywords: garlic, sulfur-containing compounds, polyphenols health benefits, metabolism and bioavailability\nSpices are not only used to increase the aroma, flavor, and color of food, but are also considered for therapeutic purposes for their potential prevention of different acute and chronic diseases. Various bioactive compounds of spices, including alkaloids, tannins, vitamins and phenolic diterpenes, flavonoids and polyphenols, as well as sulfur-containing compounds, are responsible for different types of therapeutic properties, thanks to their antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, antitumorigenic, anti-inflammatory, and glucose and cholesterol-lowering properties [1].\nGarlic (Allium sativum L.), a member of the Amaryllidaceae family that is cultivated all over the world, provides noteworthy health benefits. In 1550 B.C., antibiotics and pharmacy products were not available so garlic was used for medicinal purposes in different epidemics, such as typhus, dysentery, cholera, and influenza [2]. The therapeutic effects of garlic are mainly due to the impressive activity of its bioactive compounds, such as organic sulfides [3], saponins [4], phenolic compounds [5], and polysaccharides [6]. For example, several in vitro and in vivo studies have showed that garlic compounds are able to modulate various signaling pathways, including nuclear factor-\u03baB and wingless-related integration site [7], matrix metalloproteinases, nuclear factor erythroid 2 like 2, protein kinase B (pAkt), mitogen-activated protein kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinases, caspases, p38, transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21), TGF-\u03b2 type II receptor, psmad2/3, smad4 and smad7 [8,9], cytokines, intercellular adhesion molecule [10], notch pathway [11], 5\u2019 AMP-activated protein kinase pathway [12], vascular endothelial growth factor [13], cyclooxygenase 2, inducible nitric oxide synthase, Akt/mTOR [14], and Keap1 [15], leading to improved anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, as well as chemopreventive, antiproliferative, anti-angiogenic, antidiabetic, and cardioprotective effects. However, it should be taken into account that these compounds have a very low availability. For example, in a randomized controlled trial, after oral administration of 1 g or 3 g of dehydrated garlic powder, the organosulfur compound diallyl disulfide (DADS) and diallyl sulfide (DAS) were not detected in the urine samples after 6 and 24 h [16].

It may help the body resist or destroy viruses and other microorganisms.\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nGarlic is a polyphenolic and organosulfur enriched nutraceutical spice consumed since ancient times. Garlic and its secondary metabolites have shown excellent health-promoting and disease-preventing effects on many human common diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, blood pressure, and diabetes, through its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and lipid-lowering properties, as demonstrated in several in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies. The present review aims to provide a comprehensive overview on the consumption of garlic, garlic preparation, garlic extract, and garlic extract-derived bioactive constituents on oxidative stress, inflammation, cancer, cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, skin, bone, and other common diseases. Among the 83 human interventional trials considered, the consumption of garlic has been reported to modulate multiple biomarkers of different diseases; in addition, its combination with drugs or other food matrices has been shown to be safe and to prolong their therapeutic effects. The rapid metabolism and poor bioavailability that have limited the therapeutic use of garlic in the last years are also discussed.\nKeywords: garlic, sulfur-containing compounds, polyphenols health benefits, metabolism and bioavailability\nSpices are not only used to increase the aroma, flavor, and color of food, but are also considered for therapeutic purposes for their potential prevention of different acute and chronic diseases. Various bioactive compounds of spices, including alkaloids, tannins, vitamins and phenolic diterpenes, flavonoids and polyphenols, as well as sulfur-containing compounds, are responsible for different types of therapeutic properties, thanks to their antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, antitumorigenic, anti-inflammatory, and glucose and cholesterol-lowering properties [1].\nGarlic (Allium sativum L.), a member of the Amaryllidaceae family that is cultivated all over the world, provides noteworthy health benefits. In 1550 B.C., antibiotics and pharmacy products were not available so garlic was used for medicinal purposes in different epidemics, such as typhus, dysentery, cholera, and influenza [2]. The therapeutic effects of garlic are mainly due to the impressive activity of its bioactive compounds, such as organic sulfides [3], saponins [4], phenolic compounds [5], and polysaccharides [6]. For example, several in vitro and in vivo studies have showed that garlic compounds are able to modulate various signaling pathways, including nuclear factor-\u03baB and wingless-related integration site [7], matrix metalloproteinases, nuclear factor erythroid 2 like 2, protein kinase B (pAkt), mitogen-activated protein kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinases, caspases, p38, transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21), TGF-\u03b2 type II receptor, psmad2/3, smad4 and smad7 [8,9], cytokines, intercellular adhesion molecule [10], notch pathway [11], 5\u2019 AMP-activated protein kinase pathway [12], vascular endothelial growth factor [13], cyclooxygenase 2, inducible nitric oxide synthase, Akt/mTOR [14], and Keap1 [15], leading to improved anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, as well as chemopreventive, antiproliferative, anti-angiogenic, antidiabetic, and cardioprotective effects. However, it should be taken into account that these compounds have a very low availability. For example, in a randomized controlled trial, after oral administration of 1 g or 3 g of dehydrated garlic powder, the organosulfur compound diallyl disulfide (DADS) and diallyl sulfide (DAS) were not detected in the urine samples after 6 and 24 h [16]. Furthermore, allyl thiosulfates of garlic preparation undergo extensive metabolism, producing allyl methyl sulfide, essentially present in breath [17].\nThus, the present review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of clinical trials in the last 20 years, assessing the therapeutic effects of garlic on different common human diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular pathologies, diabetes, metabolic disorders, osteoporosis, and skin diseases, mostly focusing on its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and lipid lowering effects.
