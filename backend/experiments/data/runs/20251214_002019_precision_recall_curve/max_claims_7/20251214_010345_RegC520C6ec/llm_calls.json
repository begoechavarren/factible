    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\n7.1 billion people on this planet are completely in the dark The Continuous and escalating extreme weather events occurring every day around the planet are blamed on mother nature but nothing could be further from the [Music] truth all that is required to understand explain and demonstrate how Decades of global geoengineering development is directly and deliberately responsible for all of the Super Storms hurricanes tornadoes and floods is the understanding of a few simple [Music] Concepts however to find un altered explanations of these Concepts we must first travel back 60 years [Music] rain rain go away come again some other day two young fellas want to play one is Fred he lives in this Farm the other is Pete he lives in the city he's visiting [Music] friend boy where does all this rain come from from the sky everybody knows that [Music] but what Pete really wants to know is how does the water get into the sky well let's see Fred sees one way as the water dries off the horses it goes into the air but there are lots of other ways when the sun comes out strongly after a shower we can almost see the water disappearing into the air [Music] here heat from the Sun is drying the roof water at the top edge of the puddle slowly disappears into the air right before our eyes billions of gallons of water go into the air every hour from the ponds lakes rivers and oceans all over the world in fact everything that dries as giving water to the air even wet Fields do [Music] this and wet clothes on a line slowly lose water to the air and become [Music] dry whether you can see it or whether you can't water is always going into the air from many things even dogs give water to the air as they pant [Music] people as well as animals have to replace the water their bodies give off to the [Music] air yep there's another way water can get into the air the water on the doghouse roof dried pretty fast in the warm sun this this water disappears faster because the stove is hotter this change from water we can see to water vapor we can't see is called [Music] evaporation no that's not evaporation that water isn't changing to water vapor it's just sinking into the soil evaporation comes later the leaves give off water to the air water taken up of the plant's Roots it's hard to believe so let's find out if it's true first a cardboard disc to cover the wet soil then a jar to keep any water vapor from the leaves from being lost to the air and the jar without a [Music] plan and last time until tomorrow [Music] morning during the night the plant gave off water because the jar without the plant is dry inside the jar are droplets just like the droplets that form in the moisture from Fred's warm breath hits the window glass the water vapor changes into very small drops of water because the window is cold in the same way the water vapor from the plant changed to water when it touched the cooler surface of the jar but what happens if the glass is warm the best way to answer such a question is to try [Music] it first a glass is [Music] warm then another glass is chilled [Music] what happens with the warm glass nothing but soon on the cold glass glass water collects water from the air when this happens it's called condensation condensation causes dew on the grass during the night when the earth and grass is cooler than the air condensation takes place and the water vapor forms little drops of water the cloud from the spot of the teac kettle is condensation of the water vapor from the teac kettle hitting the colder air the water vapor in the warm air of the room forms a cloud as it hits the very cold air from the refrigerator [Music] uh-oh now what's going to happen [Music] condensation rain [Music] the hot water in the kettle gives off water vapor to the air by rapid evaporation just as rivers lakes and ponds give off water vapor to the air by slow evaporation as the hot water-filled air hits the colder air near the ice tray the water vapor turns into clouds of tiny water droplets floating in the air condensation when the air is quite cold and cannot hold any more water droplets they collect together to form larger drops as on the ice tray and being too heavy to float in the air they fall back to the Earth as [Music] rain without water in the air we couldn't live our Fields would be dry and nothing would grow because water evaporates in the air and returns again as rain we have water running through the valleys in our Brooks and streams filling reservoirs with water to drink turning our water wheels and turning the turbines and the powerhouses to give us electricity all from water in the air the fundamentals of global geoengineering are no different than this child's experiment water vapor is artificially introduced into the air in place of the natural evaporation stage and is artificially cooled and condensed to produce [Music] rain you need a great many tea kettal to produce the massive amounts of water vapor required to fuel these Global storm systems and this planet is deliberately covered with them [Music] [Music] this artificial precipitation generation is easy to see on infrared satellite and is identified by sudden coordinated bursts of superheated water vapor from no natural source [Music] [Music] ironically the same primary source of CO2 Emissions on this planet is the same source of artificial [Music] precipitation this Nationwide artificial precipitation generation site clickers like clockwork every single day [Music] hexagonal Center of Vortex with flat size proves geoengineering manufacturer nightly Nationwide coordinated artificial precipitation generation Noti is the total absence of natural precipitation before the nightly generation cycle [Music] manufactured vortex in exactly the same area rotating in the opposite direction twin vortices rotating in opposite directions Drive artificial precipitation to the southeast [Music] [Music] [Music] the same identifying cycle of circular and sudden coordinated bursts of artificial precipitation can be seen all around the world in every industrialized and colonized country [Music] in [Music] [Music] [Music] this man-made Global artificial precipitation cycle is the singular reason for massive and continuous flooding worldwide at least nine states with flash flood watches Coast to Coast tonight in Newton North Carolina look at this the water suddenly Rising above the windows of this family's home you can barely see the tops of their cars there and this roadway washed away a giant collapse under the rains today this as we get new information tonight on those two tropical systems big changes there as well we get to it all beginning with the flooding and the pictures just now coming in here's ABC meteorologist Ginger Z tonight chest deep Rescuers pulling people to Safety in Western North Carolina at least 10 Swiftwater rescues already today thanks I just it was raining so hard I did not see like any of that a state of emergency declared in cataba County more than a foot of rain in less than 24 hours busting storm drains and swallowing street signs and mailboxes it's bad it come up fast since 9:00 it probably come up 3T from the drowning Southeast to the wild Southwest that is Albuquerque New Mexico just yesterday near 90 m per hour wind gust sliced through the typically tranquil Town pour down like like a hurricane people plucked from their flooded cars the desert rains swamping the streets near Tucson Arizona the millions of tons of heavy metal nanen trails and frequency activated ice nucleation used to control these storm systems is a topic for another [Music] video however don't believe that mother nature monsoons in the United States or any other fairy tale is responsible for worldwide man-made flooding that you can't see with your own eyes look up",

By September, one-third of the country\u2019s land was underwater, and 33 million people were directly impacted.\nWhat they\u2019re saying: \u201cThe number that really stuck with me \u2014 as a mother of three children \u2014 was that during this time when people were homeless and didn\u2019t even have the shelter of a tent, let alone a home, there were 600,000 women who were going through different stages of childbirth,\u201d Khar told Axios for a new episode of the \u201cShocked\u201d podcast airing Monday.\nHow it works: Solar geoengineering would involve intentionally injecting particles of sulfur dioxide into the upper atmosphere to reflect more sunlight back into space and temporarily cool the Earth\u2019s surface.\nWhere it stands: The technology isn\u2019t currently being deployed, but Khar was part of a global consortium that began studying the issue the same year as the floods.\nThe intrigue: Scientists are deep into research on the topic.\nBetween the lines: Putting science aside, perhaps the highest-level concern is that deploying this technology could make oil companies, nations and others less inclined to reduce greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 a concern known as the \u201cmoral hazard\u201d argument.\nBut he said that shouldn\u2019t stop consideration of the technology, particularly for lower-income nations like Pakistan.\nThe big picture: Efforts to address climate change have taken a distant back seat to two physical wars, a global trade war and the world\u2019s historical superpower \u2014 the U.S. \u2014 reeling from multiple bouts of political violence within its own borders.\nMy thought bubble: Such a chaotic world that isn\u2019t aggressively addressing climate change could increase the chances of nations individually pursuing solar geoengineering as a stopgap measure that\u2019s relatively affordable and easy.\nWhat\u2019s next: A House subcommittee is holding a hearing Tuesday on these technologies, led by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R.-Ga.), who recently introduced a bill that would ban geoengineering and similar types of tech.\n\u2014 Original post via Axios\nVicki Ekstrom High Sr. Director, Communications, Marketing & External Engagement vekstrom@uchicago.edu\n\u00a92025 The University of Chicago Institute for Climate and Sustainable Growth\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Any activity performed with the intention of producing artificial changes in the composition, behavior, or dynamics of the atmosphere. See 15 Code of Federal Regulations \u00a7 908) for what is considered weather modification.\nWhat role does NOAA play in weather modification? Companies that intend to engage in weather modification activities within the United States are required by the Weather Modification Act of 1976 (15 Code of Federal Regulations \u00a7 908) to provide a report to the Administrator of NOAA at least 10 days prior to undertaking the activity. Those reports are filed via the email address weather.modification@noaa.gov and may be found at the the bottom of this page.\nDoes NOAA conduct weather modification or weather modification experiments? NOAA does not research or conduct weather modification experiments and has no plans to do so in the future.\nWhy does NOAA collect information about weather modification? The Weather Modification Reporting Act of 1972, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 330 et seq. requires that all persons who conduct weather modification activities within the United States or its territories report such activities to the U.S. Secretary of Commerce at least 10 days prior to and after undertaking the activities. Failure to report can result in fines of up to $10,000. All weather modification projects must be reported via the appropriate email address (weather.modification@noaa.gov) prior to being implemented. They are compiled and then posted on the NOAA Weather Modification Website. Activities subject to reporting.\n(a)Weather modification activities are defined as \u201cAny activity performed with the intention of producing artificial changes in the composition, behavior, or dynamics of the atmosphere\u201d (see 15 CFR \u00a7 908.1). The following, when conducted as weather modification activities, shall be reported (see 15 CFR \u00a7 908.3):\n(b) The requirement to report does not apply to activities of a purely local nature that can reasonably be expected not to modify the weather outside of the area of operation. This exception is presently limited to the use of lightning deflection or static discharge devices in aircraft, boats, or buildings, and to the use of small heat sources, fans, fogging devices, aircraft downwash, or sprays to prevent the occurrence of frost in tracts or fields planted with crops susceptible to frost or freeze damage. Also, the requirement to report does not apply to religious activities or other ceremonies, rites and rituals intended to modify the weather.\n(c) All activities noted in paragraph (a) must be reported at least 10 days before the commencement of such project or activity. However, after the Administrator has received initial notification of a planned activity, he may waive some of the subsequent reporting requirements. This decision to waive certain reporting requirements will be based on the general acceptability, from a technical or scientific viewpoint, of the apparatus and techniques to be used.\n(d) Other reporting exceptions may be made in the future by rule of the Administrator.\nHow do I file a weather modification report? The following two forms are required for those conducting weather modification:\nWhen creating your reports, please use the following coding system as your NOAA file name: year, state, first four digits of the project name, and the respective report number. For instance, for a project that takes place in 2021 in Maryland and is titled Rock Canyon, the code would be 2021MDROCK-1 (initial report) and 2021MDROCK-2 (final report). You may also use this naming convention to save your files prior to submitting.\nHow do I submit the form(s)? Please submit reports via email to weather.modification@noaa.gov. How long before my submission will be published? Submissions will usually be available in the repository within two (2) months after the end of the fiscal quarter.\nWhat if I see streaks in the sky and I think someone is modifying the weather? These are contrails, produced by planes.\nContrails are the condensed products of combustion and vapor generated by airplanes traveling at higher altitudes where the atmosphere is colder. They have been prominent atmospheric features since the beginning of jet plane travel in the early part of the twentieth century. Official observations of contrails were made just after World War I as planes began to fly at high altitudes.\nNOAA does not have federal responsibility for regulating airplane exhaust, and we do not manage the National Air Space. The Environmental Protection Agency establishes aircraft emissions standards for any air pollution that could endanger public health and welfare, pursuant to the Clean Air Act.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration administers and enforces emissions standards FAA factsheet (pdf)\nWhat is cloud seeding?\nCloud seeding requires the release of chemicals in the atmosphere in an effort to have water condense or freeze on them and become heavy enough to produce rain. Cloud seeding is considered a weather modification activity.\nNOAA does not regulate cloud seeding activities but does collect information on such activities performed in the U.S. through the requirements for reporting in the Weather Modification and Reporting Act.\nContact Information Please see our full MAINTAINING RECORDS AND SUBMITTING REPORTS ON WEATHER MODIFICATION ACTIVITIES for more information or you can contact the NOAA Weather Modification Team at weather.modification@noaa.gov.\nPublication History & Scope\nIn the late 1940's and 1950's many deemed \"the deliberate or the inadvertent alteration of atmospheric conditions by human activity\", also known as weather modification, as a promising science of the future. Currently, the most common form of weather modification is cloud seeding, which increases rain or snow, usually for the purpose of increasing the local water supply.\nAs required by that law, NOAA submitted a Report to Congr\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

An unintended test of geoengineering is ...\n\nGoogle Search Snippet:\nThe dramatic decline in ship tracks is clear evidence that humanity could cool off the planet significantly by brightening the clouds.\n\nFull Page Content:\nSunlit images of Earth, such as those we frequently see from weather satellites, provide us with beautiful and detailed information about our planet. But there is much more to learn beyond what our eyes can naturally see. Scientists also study Earth using invisible infrared wavelengths of light, providing additional ways of observing Earth\u2019s features and processes often hidden from our view.\nInfrared radiation (IR) wavelengths range from about 700 nanometers (nm) to 1 millimeter (mm). Credit: NASA.\nInfrared energy or \"light\" is part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which is the range of different types of electrical and magnetic energy in the universe. Along the spectrum, warm infrared energy sits just to the left of visible light and is what we use to observe heat and other characteristics of objects.\nObserving Earth through infrared light is particularly helpful for studying weather events, climate, objects and surfaces that are faint or obscured by smoke and other cover, or elements that are hard to visually differentiate.\nInfrared imagery can help make objects that look confusingly similar in visual light (such as clouds over sea ice) appear noticeably different. This false color image from the Suomi NPP VIIRS sensor shows sea ice and the Greenland land mass in teal while clouds appear white. Credit: NASA Earth Observatory image by Joshua Stevens using VIIRS data from LANCE, Worldview, and Suomi NPP.\n\"One great example is snow and clouds,\" said Robert Wolfe, chief of the Terrestrial Information Systems Laboratory at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"If an astronaut is looking down from space, snow can look very much like a cloud.\"\nMaking accurate measurements of snow and clouds using visible light images can be difficult. But, as Wolfe points out, snow and clouds absorb and reflect infrared sunlight differently, and those differences can be measured, compared, and used to easily tell them apart.\nNASA and other space organizations have been flying satellites with infrared sensors for nearly 50 years. Today, key NASA and joint-NASA spacecraft with sensors for examining Earth in infrared light are the Terra, Aqua, Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP), NOAA-20, and the Landsat series of satellites.\nTerra is equipped with the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER)\u2014a sensor used primarily for geological material mapping. Aqua flies with the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument, which is used to gather 3D measurements of temperature and water vapor through the atmospheric column. Both satellites are equipped with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Clouds and the Earth\u2019s Energy Radiant System (CERES) infrared-sensing instruments. MODIS and CERES scan Earth for reflected and radiated infrared light to survey its land, oceans, and atmosphere.\nThe joint NASA/NOAA Suomi NPP and NOAA-20 satellites carry the CERES instrument along with the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument. VIIRS aids scientists studying how infrared heat is driving short-term weather events.\nThe joint NASA/USGS Landsat 8 and 9 satellites carry the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) and TIRS-2, respectively, which measure land surface temperature.\nIn this Worldview Terra/MODIS land surface temperature image acquired September 20, 2022, cooler temperatures are depicted in shades of green; warmer temperatures in shades of yellow and orange. Credit: NASA Worldview.\nAnyone who wants to see and use infrared data can access much of it through the NASA Worldview satellite imagery exploration tool. Worldview allows users to layer images, maps, and other information on top of each other. Many images are updated daily and some are updated as often as every 10 minutes, essentially showing Earth as it looks right now.\n\u201cPeople think Worldview is really cool,\u201d said Minnie Wong, the Worldview systems engineer and product owner. \u201cIt has a lot of great features, such as the ability to choose from 1,000 different image types or layers. You can compare layers and images from different days, create animated GIFs, and easily download the underlying data using Earthdata Search.\u201d\nWorldview\u2019s power to provide remarkably current data makes it valuable for researchers and professionals working in fire and natural resources management, air quality assessment, disaster response, and other areas where up-to-date IR data are critical for emergency response and event monitoring. When storms, fires, and other significant events are taking place, Worldview's Events tab offers easy access to pre-selected imagery that is most helpful in understanding them.\nEach fire icon and dot in this NASA FIRMS US/Canada Fire Map image from September 22, 2022, indicates a detected thermal anomaly. Clicking on a detected hotspot brings up more detailed information. Credit: NASA FIRMS.\nThe ability of infrared sensors to detect radiated heat makes them ideal for identifying wildfires and other thermal anomalies. To track wildfires, NASA operates the Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS). Similar to NASA Worldview, FIRMS offers a visual dashboard of maps and satellite images researchers and other experts can use to track active wildland fires around the world. Fire locations and other data are gathered from infrared sensors aboard the Suomi NPP, NOAA-20, Aqua, and Terra satellites.\n\u201cFIRMS provides a global view of where fires and other thermal anomalies are occurring and this can be incredibly useful\u2014particularly in remote areas, where active fire data provided through FIRMS is often the first notification of a fire,\u201d said Diane Davies, the operations manager for NASA\u2019s Land Atmosphere Near-real-time Capability for EOS (LANCE), which houses FIRMS. \u201cActive fire detections can be viewed interactively using the FIRMS Fire Map application, and active fire data can be downloaded in easy-to-use formats, delivered through email alerts,\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Any activity performed with the intention of producing artificial changes in the composition, behavior, or dynamics of the atmosphere. See 15 Code of Federal Regulations \u00a7 908) for what is considered weather modification.\nWhat role does NOAA play in weather modification? Companies that intend to engage in weather modification activities within the United States are required by the Weather Modification Act of 1976 (15 Code of Federal Regulations \u00a7 908) to provide a report to the Administrator of NOAA at least 10 days prior to undertaking the activity. Those reports are filed via the email address weather.modification@noaa.gov and may be found at the the bottom of this page.\nDoes NOAA conduct weather modification or weather modification experiments? NOAA does not research or conduct weather modification experiments and has no plans to do so in the future.\nWhy does NOAA collect information about weather modification? The Weather Modification Reporting Act of 1972, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 330 et seq. requires that all persons who conduct weather modification activities within the United States or its territories report such activities to the U.S. Secretary of Commerce at least 10 days prior to and after undertaking the activities. Failure to report can result in fines of up to $10,000. All weather modification projects must be reported via the appropriate email address (weather.modification@noaa.gov) prior to being implemented. They are compiled and then posted on the NOAA Weather Modification Website. Activities subject to reporting.\n(a)Weather modification activities are defined as \u201cAny activity performed with the intention of producing artificial changes in the composition, behavior, or dynamics of the atmosphere\u201d (see 15 CFR \u00a7 908.1). The following, when conducted as weather modification activities, shall be reported (see 15 CFR \u00a7 908.3):\n(b) The requirement to report does not apply to activities of a purely local nature that can reasonably be expected not to modify the weather outside of the area of operation. This exception is presently limited to the use of lightning deflection or static discharge devices in aircraft, boats, or buildings, and to the use of small heat sources, fans, fogging devices, aircraft downwash, or sprays to prevent the occurrence of frost in tracts or fields planted with crops susceptible to frost or freeze damage. Also, the requirement to report does not apply to religious activities or other ceremonies, rites and rituals intended to modify the weather.\n(c) All activities noted in paragraph (a) must be reported at least 10 days before the commencement of such project or activity. However, after the Administrator has received initial notification of a planned activity, he may waive some of the subsequent reporting requirements. This decision to waive certain reporting requirements will be based on the general acceptability, from a technical or scientific viewpoint, of the apparatus and techniques to be used.\n(d) Other reporting exceptions may be made in the future by rule of the Administrator.\nHow do I file a weather modification report? The following two forms are required for those conducting weather modification:\nWhen creating your reports, please use the following coding system as your NOAA file name: year, state, first four digits of the project name, and the respective report number. For instance, for a project that takes place in 2021 in Maryland and is titled Rock Canyon, the code would be 2021MDROCK-1 (initial report) and 2021MDROCK-2 (final report). You may also use this naming convention to save your files prior to submitting.\nHow do I submit the form(s)? Please submit reports via email to weather.modification@noaa.gov. How long before my submission will be published? Submissions will usually be available in the repository within two (2) months after the end of the fiscal quarter.\nWhat if I see streaks in the sky and I think someone is modifying the weather? These are contrails, produced by planes.\nContrails are the condensed products of combustion and vapor generated by airplanes traveling at higher altitudes where the atmosphere is colder. They have been prominent atmospheric features since the beginning of jet plane travel in the early part of the twentieth century. Official observations of contrails were made just after World War I as planes began to fly at high altitudes.\nNOAA does not have federal responsibility for regulating airplane exhaust, and we do not manage the National Air Space. The Environmental Protection Agency establishes aircraft emissions standards for any air pollution that could endanger public health and welfare, pursuant to the Clean Air Act.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration administers and enforces emissions standards FAA factsheet (pdf)\nWhat is cloud seeding?\nCloud seeding requires the release of chemicals in the atmosphere in an effort to have water condense or freeze on them and become heavy enough to produce rain. Cloud seeding is considered a weather modification activity.\nNOAA does not regulate cloud seeding activities but does collect information on such activities performed in the U.S. through the requirements for reporting in the Weather Modification and Reporting Act.\nContact Information Please see our full MAINTAINING RECORDS AND SUBMITTING REPORTS ON WEATHER MODIFICATION ACTIVITIES for more information or you can contact the NOAA Weather Modification Team at weather.modification@noaa.gov.\nPublication History & Scope\nIn the late 1940's and 1950's many deemed \"the deliberate or the inadvertent alteration of atmospheric conditions by human activity\", also known as weather modification, as a promising science of the future. Currently, the most common form of weather modification is cloud seeding, which increases rain or snow, usually for the purpose of increasing the local water supply.\nAs required by that law, NOAA submitted a Report to Congr\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Population Division estimates the world population reached 8 billion on November 15, 2022.\nOnly around 4% of the world population (all in Africa) lives in a country with very high fertility \u2014 above 5 children per woman. Even in countries with very high fertility, fertility is generally lower than it was in the past.\nWhy the discrepancy? Many of the world\u2019s most populous countries (such as India and Nigeria), haven\u2019t conducted a census in over 10 years, and many countries lack civil registration and vital statistics systems that accurately record births and deaths among their population.\nGiven the lack of precise population data worldwide, the U.N. and Census Bureau estimates are not that far apart, and both imply similar overall trends.\nThe rate of growth peaked decades ago in the 1960s and has been declining since and is projected to continue declining.\nWhile it took 12.5 years for the world to go from 7 billion to 8 billion people, we project it will likely take 14.1 years to go from 8 billion to 9 billion, and another 16.4 years to go from 9 billion to 10 billion.\nDespite a slowdown, we project the world population will reach 10.2 billion by 2060.\nThese broad global trends mask wide diversity. Population growth is the result of fertility, mortality, migration and the share of the population at certain ages. These trends all differ from country to country and, as a result, population growth varies around the world.\nNearly three quarters (74%) of the earth\u2019s population reside in countries where fertility is around or below the replacement level.\nIt is widely believed that 2.1 is the replacement-level fertility rate \u2014 the number of births a woman would need to have in her lifetime to replace herself and the father. However, the precise level of fertility necessary for long-term replacement varies between countries due to different mortality rates.\nAround 33% of the world population \u2014 approximately 1 in 3 people \u2014 lives in a country with a fertility rate close to replacement, including diverse countries such as India, Tunisia and Argentina.\nDemographers once assumed fertility would stop declining once it reached replacement levels. But it has continued to decline below replacement levels in many countries.\nAround 15% of the world\u2019s population lives in a country with low fertility of 1.6 to 1.8 children per woman. This includes a diverse range of countries like Brazil, Mexico, the United States and Sweden.\nAnother 26% \u2014 about 1 in 4 people \u2014 lives in a country with very low fertility at 1.5 children or fewer per woman. Such countries include China, South Korea and Spain.\nAnother 23% lives in a country with moderately high fertility between 2.3 and 5.0 children. This broad category includes a diverse range of countries like Papua New Guinea, Israel and Ethiopia.\nOnly around 4% of the world population (all in Africa) lives in a country with very high fertility \u2014 above 5 children per woman. Even in countries with very high fertility, fertility is generally lower than it was in the past.\nAnd we project that by 2060, no country will have an average of four or more children per woman, let alone five or six children per woman.\nIt\u2019s projected that Benin will have the world\u2019s highest projected total fertility rate (3.8) in 2060. There will, of course, still be women who have four or more children, but it is unlikely entire countries will average four or more children per woman.\nThe world population is projected to keep growing despite declining fertility rates. In fact, we estimate the number of infants already peaked in 2017. Instead, population growth in the future will come from larger groups of people at adult ages. Demographers call this phenomenon population momentum.\nFigure 3 shows the world population by age in 2023 and the projected population by age in 2060. Population growth between now and 2060 will be from the population pyramid \u201cfilling up\u201d previously sparse older age groups, not from growing numbers of births.\nFigure 4 shows how the growth of the older-adult population is projected to make up most of the population growth between now and 2060. Future population growth will be coincident with population aging.\nAs fertility declines, there are proportionally fewer younger people and more older people.\nThe share of the population at young ages has been declining. Today, 32% of people are 19 or younger. By 2060, that number is projected to slip to 26%.\nAs the share of young people declines, the proportion of people at older ages increases. Today, 10% of the world is 65 or older and their share is projected to double to 20% by 2060.\nAs a result, the median age is changing. Today, the global median age is 32 (half the population is younger and half older). By 2060, however, the global median age is projected to climb to 39 years.\nThese general trends vary by country. Niger is the world\u2019s youngest country, with a median age of 15 in 2023. Monaco, by contrast, is the oldest, with a median age of 56 in 2023.\nIn many countries where young-age mortality is already low, gains in life expectancy come from improving conditions at older ages.\nCanada, for instance, did not experience big declines in young-age mortality between 2000 and 2023, but its total life expectancy increased by an average of about 4 years, largely from reduced mortality at older ages.\nFor many other countries, however, life expectancy trends are driven more by dramatic declines in child mortality.

    "input_prompt": "Claim:\nArtificial precipitation generation is visible on infrared satellite images.\n\nArticle Title:\nSolar Geoengineering and Climate Change - Congress.gov\n\nGoogle Search Snippet:\nSolar geoengineering (SG) refers to a set of methods aimed at cooling the Earth in order to counteract the warming effects of increases in greenhouse gases ( ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nSunlit images of Earth, such as those we frequently see from weather satellites, provide us with beautiful and detailed information about our planet. But there is much more to learn beyond what our eyes can naturally see. Scientists also study Earth using invisible infrared wavelengths of light, providing additional ways of observing Earth\u2019s features and processes often hidden from our view.\nInfrared radiation (IR) wavelengths range from about 700 nanometers (nm) to 1 millimeter (mm). Credit: NASA.\nInfrared energy or \"light\" is part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which is the range of different types of electrical and magnetic energy in the universe. Along the spectrum, warm infrared energy sits just to the left of visible light and is what we use to observe heat and other characteristics of objects.\nObserving Earth through infrared light is particularly helpful for studying weather events, climate, objects and surfaces that are faint or obscured by smoke and other cover, or elements that are hard to visually differentiate.\nInfrared imagery can help make objects that look confusingly similar in visual light (such as clouds over sea ice) appear noticeably different. This false color image from the Suomi NPP VIIRS sensor shows sea ice and the Greenland land mass in teal while clouds appear white. Credit: NASA Earth Observatory image by Joshua Stevens using VIIRS data from LANCE, Worldview, and Suomi NPP.\n\"One great example is snow and clouds,\" said Robert Wolfe, chief of the Terrestrial Information Systems Laboratory at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"If an astronaut is looking down from space, snow can look very much like a cloud.\"\nMaking accurate measurements of snow and clouds using visible light images can be difficult. But, as Wolfe points out, snow and clouds absorb and reflect infrared sunlight differently, and those differences can be measured, compared, and used to easily tell them apart.\nNASA and other space organizations have been flying satellites with infrared sensors for nearly 50 years. Today, key NASA and joint-NASA spacecraft with sensors for examining Earth in infrared light are the Terra, Aqua, Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP), NOAA-20, and the Landsat series of satellites.\nTerra is equipped with the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER)\u2014a sensor used primarily for geological material mapping. Aqua flies with the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument, which is used to gather 3D measurements of temperature and water vapor through the atmospheric column. Both satellites are equipped with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Clouds and the Earth\u2019s Energy Radiant System (CERES) infrared-sensing instruments. MODIS and CERES scan Earth for reflected and radiated infrared light to survey its land, oceans, and atmosphere.\nThe joint NASA/NOAA Suomi NPP and NOAA-20 satellites carry the CERES instrument along with the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument. VIIRS aids scientists studying how infrared heat is driving short-term weather events.\nThe joint NASA/USGS Landsat 8 and 9 satellites carry the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) and TIRS-2, respectively, which measure land surface temperature.\nIn this Worldview Terra/MODIS land surface temperature image acquired September 20, 2022, cooler temperatures are depicted in shades of green; warmer temperatures in shades of yellow and orange. Credit: NASA Worldview.\nAnyone who wants to see and use infrared data can access much of it through the NASA Worldview satellite imagery exploration tool. Worldview allows users to layer images, maps, and other information on top of each other. Many images are updated daily and some are updated as often as every 10 minutes, essentially showing Earth as it looks right now.\n\u201cPeople think Worldview is really cool,\u201d said Minnie Wong, the Worldview systems engineer and product owner. \u201cIt has a lot of great features, such as the ability to choose from 1,000 different image types or layers. You can compare layers and images from different days, create animated GIFs, and easily download the underlying data using Earthdata Search.\u201d\nWorldview\u2019s power to provide remarkably current data makes it valuable for researchers and professionals working in fire and natural resources management, air quality assessment, disaster response, and other areas where up-to-date IR data are critical for emergency response and event monitoring. When storms, fires, and other significant events are taking place, Worldview's Events tab offers easy access to pre-selected imagery that is most helpful in understanding them.\nEach fire icon and dot in this NASA FIRMS US/Canada Fire Map image from September 22, 2022, indicates a detected thermal anomaly. Clicking on a detected hotspot brings up more detailed information. Credit: NASA FIRMS.\nThe ability of infrared sensors to detect radiated heat makes them ideal for identifying wildfires and other thermal anomalies. To track wildfires, NASA operates the Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS). Similar to NASA Worldview, FIRMS offers a visual dashboard of maps and satellite images researchers and other experts can use to track active wildland fires around the world. Fire locations and other data are gathered from infrared sensors aboard the Suomi NPP, NOAA-20, Aqua, and Terra satellites.\n\u201cFIRMS provides a global view of where fires and other thermal anomalies are occurring and this can be incredibly useful\u2014particularly in remote areas, where active fire data provided through FIRMS is often the first notification of a fire,\u201d said Diane Davies, the operations manager for NASA\u2019s Land Atmosphere Near-real-time Capability for EOS (LANCE), which houses FIRMS. \u201cActive fire detections can be viewed interactively using the FIRMS Fire Map application, and active fire data can be downloaded in easy-to-use formats, delivered through email alerts,\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

    "input_prompt": "Claim:\n7.1 billion people are on this planet.\n\nArticle Title:\nWorld Population Estimated at 8 Billion - U.S. Census Bureau\n\nGoogle Search Snippet:\nUsing data from the International Database, the U.S. Census Bureau estimates the world population hit 8 billion on September 26.\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nUsing data from the International Database, the U.S. Census Bureau estimates the world population hit 8 billion on September 26.\nEmphasis on the word estimates.\nThere are many sources of uncertainty in estimating the global population, and it\u2019s unlikely this population milestone was reached on that exact date.\nFor example, the United Nations (U.N.) Population Division estimates the world population reached 8 billion on November 15, 2022.\nOnly around 4% of the world population (all in Africa) lives in a country with very high fertility \u2014 above 5 children per woman. Even in countries with very high fertility, fertility is generally lower than it was in the past.\nWhy the discrepancy? Many of the world\u2019s most populous countries (such as India and Nigeria), haven\u2019t conducted a census in over 10 years, and many countries lack civil registration and vital statistics systems that accurately record births and deaths among their population.\nGiven the lack of precise population data worldwide, the U.N. and Census Bureau estimates are not that far apart, and both imply similar overall trends.\nThe rate of growth peaked decades ago in the 1960s and has been declining since and is projected to continue declining.\nWhile it took 12.5 years for the world to go from 7 billion to 8 billion people, we project it will likely take 14.1 years to go from 8 billion to 9 billion, and another 16.4 years to go from 9 billion to 10 billion.\nDespite a slowdown, we project the world population will reach 10.2 billion by 2060.\nThese broad global trends mask wide diversity. Population growth is the result of fertility, mortality, migration and the share of the population at certain ages. These trends all differ from country to country and, as a result, population growth varies around the world.\nNearly three quarters (74%) of the earth\u2019s population reside in countries where fertility is around or below the replacement level.\nIt is widely believed that 2.1 is the replacement-level fertility rate \u2014 the number of births a woman would need to have in her lifetime to replace herself and the father. However, the precise level of fertility necessary for long-term replacement varies between countries due to different mortality rates.\nAround 33% of the world population \u2014 approximately 1 in 3 people \u2014 lives in a country with a fertility rate close to replacement, including diverse countries such as India, Tunisia and Argentina.\nDemographers once assumed fertility would stop declining once it reached replacement levels. But it has continued to decline below replacement levels in many countries.\nAround 15% of the world\u2019s population lives in a country with low fertility of 1.6 to 1.8 children per woman. This includes a diverse range of countries like Brazil, Mexico, the United States and Sweden.\nAnother 26% \u2014 about 1 in 4 people \u2014 lives in a country with very low fertility at 1.5 children or fewer per woman. Such countries include China, South Korea and Spain.\nAnother 23% lives in a country with moderately high fertility between 2.3 and 5.0 children. This broad category includes a diverse range of countries like Papua New Guinea, Israel and Ethiopia.\nOnly around 4% of the world population (all in Africa) lives in a country with very high fertility \u2014 above 5 children per woman. Even in countries with very high fertility, fertility is generally lower than it was in the past.\nAnd we project that by 2060, no country will have an average of four or more children per woman, let alone five or six children per woman.\nIt\u2019s projected that Benin will have the world\u2019s highest projected total fertility rate (3.8) in 2060. There will, of course, still be women who have four or more children, but it is unlikely entire countries will average four or more children per woman.\nThe world population is projected to keep growing despite declining fertility rates. In fact, we estimate the number of infants already peaked in 2017. Instead, population growth in the future will come from larger groups of people at adult ages. Demographers call this phenomenon population momentum.\nFigure 3 shows the world population by age in 2023 and the projected population by age in 2060. Population growth between now and 2060 will be from the population pyramid \u201cfilling up\u201d previously sparse older age groups, not from growing numbers of births.\nFigure 4 shows how the growth of the older-adult population is projected to make up most of the population growth between now and 2060. Future population growth will be coincident with population aging.\nAs fertility declines, there are proportionally fewer younger people and more older people.\nThe share of the population at young ages has been declining. Today, 32% of people are 19 or younger. By 2060, that number is projected to slip to 26%.\nAs the share of young people declines, the proportion of people at older ages increases. Today, 10% of the world is 65 or older and their share is projected to double to 20% by 2060.\nAs a result, the median age is changing. Today, the global median age is 32 (half the population is younger and half older). By 2060, however, the global median age is projected to climb to 39 years.\nThese general trends vary by country. Niger is the world\u2019s youngest country, with a median age of 15 in 2023. Monaco, by contrast, is the oldest, with a median age of 56 in 2023.\nIn many countries where young-age mortality is already low, gains in life expectancy come from improving conditions at older ages.\nCanada, for instance, did not experience big declines in young-age mortality between 2000 and 2023, but its total life expectancy increased by an average of about 4 years, largely from reduced mortality at older ages.\nFor many other countries, however, life expectancy trends are driven more by dramatic declines in child mortality. In Niger, for example, child mortality declined from around 224 deaths of children under 5 per 1,000 births in 2000 to 103 deaths per 1,\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Water moves from the Earth\u2019s surface to the atmosphere via evaporation.\n\u2022 Water Science School HOME \u2022 The Water Cycle \u2022\nWater cycle components \u00bb Atmosphere \u00b7 Condensation \u00b7 Evaporation \u00b7 Evapotranspiration \u00b7 Freshwater lakes and rivers \u00b7 Groundwater flow \u00b7 Groundwater storage \u00b7 Ice and snow \u00b7 Infiltration \u00b7 Oceans \u00b7 Precipitation \u00b7 Snowmelt \u00b7 Springs \u00b7 Streamflow \u00b7 Sublimation \u00b7 Surface runoff\nEvaporation is the process that changes liquid water to gaseous water (water vapor). Water moves from the Earth\u2019s surface to the atmosphere via evaporation.\nEvaporation occurs when energy (heat) forces the bonds that hold water molecules together to break. When you\u2019re boiling water on the stove, you\u2019re adding heat to liquid water. This added heat breaks the bonds, causing the water to shift from its liquid state to its gaseous state (water vapor), which we know as steam.\nWater easily evaporates at its boiling point (212\u00b0 F, 100\u00b0 C) but evaporates much more slowly at its freezing point because of the heat energy required to evaporate the water.\nThe opposite of evaporation is condensation. Condensation is the process of water vapor turning back into liquid water. Condensation occurs when saturated air is cooled, such as on the outside of a glass of ice water.\nMost of the moisture in the atmosphere (about 90%) came from water evaporating from oceans, seas, lakes, and rivers. (And because over 70% of Earth\u2019s surface is covered by oceans, they contribute a lot to the overall volume of water evaporating into the atmosphere.) The rest of the moisture in the atmosphere came from plant transpiration and (a very small amount) from sublimation.\nOn a global scale, the amount of water evaporating is about the same as the amount of water delivered to the Earth as precipitation.\nThis does vary geographically, though. Evaporation is more prevalent over the oceans than precipitation, while over the land, precipitation routinely exceeds evaporation. Most of the water that evaporates from the oceans falls back into the oceans as precipitation. Only about 10 percent of the water evaporated from the oceans is transported over land and falls as precipitation. Once evaporated, a water molecule spends about 10 days in the air. The process of evaporation is so great that without precipitation runoff, and groundwater discharge from aquifers, oceans would become nearly empty.\nOne way to produce table salt is to evaporate saline water in evaporation ponds, a technique used by people for thousands of years.\nSeawater contains other valuable minerals that are easily obtained due to evaporation. Water from the Dead Sea is ideal for the extraction of not only table salt, but also magnesium, potash, and bromine. The Dead Sea is actually a lake, located in the Middle East within a closed watershed and without any means of outflow. This closed basin system is abnormal for most lakes. Water primarily leaves the lake by evaporating, resulting in upwards of 1,300 - 1,600 millimeters of evaporated water per year in this desert area! The result is that the waters of the Dead Sea have the highest salinity and density of any sea in the world, too high to support life.\n(Source: Overview of Middle East Water Resources, Middle East Water Data Banks Project).\nBecause energy is required to break the bonds holding water molecules together, evaporation removes heat from the environment, leading to a net cooling. Think of when a physician wipes an alcohol pad on your arm before giving you an injection \u2013 your arm feels cold. That\u2019s because the alcohol rapidly evaporates from the surface of your skin, and with it some heat from the surface of your arm.\nIn climates where the humidity is low and the temperatures are hot, an evaporative cooler can lower the air temperature by 20 degrees F., while it increases humidity. As this map shows, evaporative coolers work best in the dry areas of the United States (red areas marked A) and can work somewhat in the blue areas marked B. But in section C, in the humid eastern U.S., normal air conditioners must be used.\nEvaporative coolers are really quite simple devices, at least compared to air conditioners, because they pull in the dry, hot outdoor air and pass it through an evaporative pad that is kept wet by a supply of water. In a home device, a fan draws the air through the pad causing the water in the pad to evaporate, resulting in cooler air which is then pumped through the house. Much less energy is used as compared to an air conditioner.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Traditional forecasts rely on ground-based radar systems, which are space-constrained and have high maintenance costs. Consequently, most developing countries depend on a global numerical model with low resolution, instead of operating their own radar systems. To mitigate this gap, we propose the Neural Precipitation Model (NPM), which uses global-scale geostationary satellite imagery. NPM predicts precipitation for up to six hours, with an update every hour. We take three key channels to discriminate rain clouds as input: infrared radiation (at a wavelength of 10.5 \u03bc \u2062 m ), upper- (6.3 \u03bc \u2062 m ), and lower- (7.3 \u03bc \u2062 m ) level water vapor channels. Additionally, NPM introduces positional encoders to capture seasonal and temporal patterns, accounting for variations in precipitation. Our experimental results demonstrate that NPM can predict rainfall in real-time with a resolution of 2 km. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/seominseok0429/Data-driven-Precipitation-Nowcasting-Using-Satellite-Imagery.\nAs global warming accelerates, the damage caused by natural disasters is on the rise. Particularly with increasing temperatures, the intensity of extreme precipitation events escalates (Ombadi et al. 2023), leading to significant human casualties due to disasters such as floods, landslides, and soil erosion. To mitigate the loss of life from these disasters, accurate and real-time precipitation forecasting is essential.\nTraditionally, precipitation forecasting relies on various observational equipment such as radar systems and numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. For instance, the HRRR model (Dowell et al. 2022) utilizes radar data, satellite data, surface observations, aircraft data, weather buoys and ships, model initialization data, and fire/smoke data to provide forecasts at a resolution of approximately 3 km. Additionally, global NWP models such as ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) (Hersbach et al. 2020) and integrated forecasting system (IFS) (Wedi et al. 2015) perform forecasts at a resolution of around 25 km.\nDespite advancements in the observational equipment and the NWP models, essential tools for precipitation forecasting involve installation and maintenance costs that can reach about billions of dollars. Furthermore, algorithms like IFS and ERA5 require supercomputers, making them challenging to operate in countries with limited budgets and resources.\nTo overcome these issues, numerous data-driven weather forecasting methods have been proposed. Pangu-Weather (Bi et al. 2023) and GraphCast (Lam et al. 2023) demonstrate superior performance compared to traditional NWP models like IFS, even when running in a single GPU environment. Similarly, a series of MetNet (Andrychowicz et al. 2023; S\u00f8nderby et al. 2020) shows high accuracy in precipitation forecasting while also operating efficiently on a single GPU. However, these global weather forecasting models still rely on NWP data for their initial conditions, meaning they have not fully eliminated the dependency on supercomputers. Additionally, with a resolution of 25 km, they remain insufficient for predicting localized heavy rainfall events, such as flash floods.\nThe MetNet series and various radar-to-radar benchmark (Veillette, Samsi, and Mattioli 2020) models take radar data as input, and produce radar-based outputs, making radar infrastructure essential. Moreover, radar-to-radar models are unable to detect developing precipitation types that do not appear in radar signals yet, further reducing their effectiveness in certain situations.\nTo address the challenges of supercomputer dependency, radar-only systems, and the difficulty of predicting precipitation without prior radar signals, we propose the real-time neural precipitation model (NPM). In addition, to train our NPM model, we introduce the Geostationary Satellite-to-Radar dataset, which is called Sat2Rdr. Our approach is inspired by traditional methods of predicting precipitation using atmospheric states and cloud characteristics from satellite imagery, which have historically relied on the correlation between cloud-top brightness temperature and surface rainfall rates (Arkin 1979; Sorooshian et al. 2000; Huffman et al. 2010). The dataset utilizes the Infrared (IR) channel at 10.5 \u03bc \u2062 m , the Water Vapor (WV) channel at 6.3 \u03bc \u2062 m , and the WV channel at 7.3 \u03bc \u2062 m \u2014channels closely linked to precipitation in traditional algorithms.\nOur NPM consists of two stages: The first stage predicts satellite images showing the formation and dissipation of clouds associated with precipitation. The second stage estimates rainfall from the predicted satellite images, accurately predicting rain rates by analyzing cloud type and growth stage through infrared and water vapor channels.\nSince the NPM relies solely on satellite imagery, it does not inherently predict seasonal or diurnal precipitation patterns. To overcome this, we incorporate day and hour positional embeddings into the NPM, allowing it to learn these patterns. As shown in Figure 1 from the Papua New Guinea flood case, NPM is capable of forecasting precipitation even in regions without radar coverage, as it uses only satellite imagery and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data as input.\nWe validate the effectiveness of our NPM using various video prediction models on the geostationa\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Condensation is crucial to the water cycle because it is responsible for the formation of clouds.\nEvaporation\u2013 the process by which water changes from a liquid to a gas or vapor. Evaporation is the primary pathway that water moves from the liquid state back into the water cycle as atmospheric water vapor.

It is the primary connection in the water cycle that provides for the delivery of atmospheric water to the Earth. Most precipitation falls as rain.\nSaturated water content\u2013 the water content when water fills every available pore space in a soil. When soils are saturated, new rain has nowhere to go and flooding is likely.\nSnowmelt runoff to streams\u2013 the movement of water as surface runoff from snow and ice to surface water. It is a major component of the global movement of water.\nSoil water content- soil is made of many small mineral and organic particles, with pore space between them that can be filled with air or water.

Most of the moisture in the atmosphere (about 90%) came from water evaporating from oceans, seas, lakes, and rivers. (And ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nHubbard Brook > WaterViz > Water Cycle Glossary\nCondensation\u2013 the process by which water vapor in the air is changed into liquid water. Condensation is crucial to the water cycle because it is responsible for the formation of clouds.\nEvaporation\u2013 the process by which water changes from a liquid to a gas or vapor. Evaporation is the primary pathway that water moves from the liquid state back into the water cycle as atmospheric water vapor. Studies have shown that the oceans, seas, lakes, and rivers provide nearly 90 percent of the moisture in the atmosphere via evaporation, with the remaining 10 percent being contributed by plant transpiration.\nEvapotranspiration\u2013 the sum of evaporation from the land surface plus transpiration from plants.\nFreshwater storage\u2013 freshwater existing on the Earth\u2019s surface, which includes streams, ponds, lakes, reservoirs, and freshwater wetlands. The definition of freshwater is water containing less than 1,000 milligrams per liter of dissolved solids, most often salt.\nGroundwater discharge\u2013 groundwater is discharged when it emerges back to the surface of the Earth and flows into stream beds.\nGroundwater storage\u2013 water existing for long periods below the Earth\u2019s surface. The water is still moving, possibly very slowly, and it is still part of the water cycle. Most of the water in the ground comes from precipitation that infiltrates downward from the land surface.\nInfiltration\u2013 the downward movement of water from the land surface into soil or porous rock.\nPrecipitation\u2013 water released from clouds in the form of rain, freezing rain, sleet, snow, or hail. It is the primary connection in the water cycle that provides for the delivery of atmospheric water to the Earth. Most precipitation falls as rain.\nSaturated water content\u2013 the water content when water fills every available pore space in a soil. When soils are saturated, new rain has nowhere to go and flooding is likely.\nSnowmelt runoff to streams\u2013 the movement of water as surface runoff from snow and ice to surface water. It is a major component of the global movement of water.\nSoil water content- soil is made of many small mineral and organic particles, with pore space between them that can be filled with air or water. Soil water content is the percentage of a soil volume that is water. In other words, if soil water content is 25%, that means that a 1 cubic meter of soil contains 0.25 cubic meters of water.\nSolar radiation \u2013 A measurement of global solar radiation\u2014the combination of direct and diffuse solar radiation\u2014in the 400 to 1100 nm range. Measurement units are in watts per square meter (W m-2)\nSprings\u2013 a water resource formed when the side of a hill, a valley bottom or other excavation intersects a flowing body of groundwater at or below the local water table. A spring is the result of an aquifer being filled to the point that the water overflows onto the land surface. They range in size from intermittent seeps, which flow only after much rain, to huge pools with a flow of hundreds of millions of gallons per day.\nStreamflow\u2013 the movement and amount of water flowing in a natural channel, such as a river.\nSublimation\u2013 the process by which water changes from a solid (ice or snow) to a gas, bypassing the liquid phase. When dry air hits snow, it changes the snow directly into water vapor, bypassing the liquid phase. Sublimation is a common way for snow to disappear quickly in arid climates.\nSurface runoff\u2013 the water in rivers which comes directly from runoff from the land surface; this accounts for most of the water in rivers (other inputs are direct precipitation and ground water).\nTranspiration\u2013 is essentially evaporation of water from plant leaves. Studies have revealed that transpiration accounts for about 10 percent of the moisture in the atmosphere, with oceans, seas, and other bodies of water (lakes, rivers, streams) providing nearly 90 percent.\nWater in the atmosphere\u2013 water stored in the atmosphere as vapor, such as clouds and humidity. Only about 0.001 percent of the total Earth\u2019s water volume is stored in the atmosphere at any given time.\nWater storage in ice and snow\u2013 freshwater stored in frozen form, generally in glaciers, icecaps and fields, and snowfields. Water may be locked up in this state for a relatively long period of time.\nWater storage in oceans\u2013 saline water existing in oceans and inland seas. Much more water is \u201cin storage\u201d for long periods of time than is actually moving through the cycle; 96.5 % of the world\u2019s water supply is stored in the oceans. It is also estimated that the oceans supply about 90 percent of the evaporated water that goes into the water cycle.\nWater vapor\u2013 Vapor Pressure Deficit, or VPD, is the difference (deficit) between the amount of moisture in the air and how much moisture the air can hold when it is saturated. Once air becomes saturated water will condense out to form clouds, dew or films of water over leaves or surfaces.\nMost definitions from the USGS Water Science School\nCopyright - USFS\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",
