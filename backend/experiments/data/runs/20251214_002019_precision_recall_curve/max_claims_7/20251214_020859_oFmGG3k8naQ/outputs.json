      "text": "hi everyone this is monty i've been doing some investigation into the floor nation of our uh water here in lebanon oregon and i got a letter from the harvard university they posted in the federal government's journal confirms that fluoride lowers iqs and that was on july 27 2012. you can you can most likely find it in uh just by typing in but you can see it's a major harvard university study that confirms that the fluorination of our city water lowers our children's iq now you would think that that would cause writing in the streets demanding that we would have fluoride removed from our water but ironically it doesn't another study this one done by harvard university on july 26th that says it was published in the national institute of health journal finds that fluoride lowers children's iq that's the florida nation of your city water and this is the article right here again it's a harvard university study now both of those were done in this year and you would think that as soon as the american people found out for sure through harvard university after they've done extensive studies that the fluoridation of our water supply causes our children redox retardation making our children's iqs lower causing problems and and families and health you think that people would uh be freaking out and getting the flu right out you think we wouldn't even have to ask our governments and our townships to remove the fluoride fluoride from our water they don't do it you have to fight tooth and now and chances are they're sterile aren't going to do it but if you're not worried about lowering iqs you know everybody says oh my kid's stupid you know we're used to hearing it but here's another release published in april 5th 2006 another one from harvard university studies shows a link between fluorinated water and bone cancer in boys so you know it just goes on and on it's just link after link all of these studies from harvard university uh not to mention the 3600 000 other studies that have been done by numerous people that just plagues this whole fluoridation of water and that people aren't doing anything about it they're not stopping it why is this being put in our water when it is causing the iqs of our children to be lowered causing uh all kinds of problems now here's a great thing me and my girl went to see her obgyn the other day and she had some work done on her while i was in the office i was talking to this specialist with women and children this lady is a doctor who specializes in child rearing and and women issues and stuff and i asked her what she knew about fluoride and she said that she strongly recommends that babies be fed special water that has been specially more foreign more fluorination put in the baby's water for the use of their uh for for their feedings and i asked her if she looked into it she said she felt some concerns about the recent stories of uh you know how fluoride is linked in in brain damage and she she said she hadn't really looked into it too much and i said well i just got you know i told her the story i just got this information on july 26 27th that uh from harvard saying that they definitely have confirmed it does lower uh children's iq and she said for years she'd been telling mothers of newborn babies to buy fluorinated water to feed their babies to put in their babies bottles so that their baby's teeth would be better and stronger well here's an interesting note the nurse that was helping this doctor says hey wait a minute uh i come from austin texas and they have natural fluorination of the water there where the water is over fluorinated and everybody in the town all the town of 300 000 people have white pitted stuff on their teeth and uh she said and everybody in the town acts literally like a bunch of dumbasses those are her words not mine she said that it's just a bunch of hooligans and everybody's kind of hillbilly mentality real low iq individuals and of course their waters naturally overflowed fluorinated it's called uh fluorination opmosis or something like that when you have too much fluorine in your body you get uh white spots on your teeth now here's just a thought if you know anybody with white spots on their teeth ask them a couple of simple questions and see if they're a dumbass because from what i hear from this nurse the people over in austin texas or somewhere around that uh all live in a town where the water has too much fluorine in it naturally and they're all a bunch of dumbasses uh hicks you know she this is her words not mine i i don't know i live in lebanon oregon and uh at any rate get sidetracked here there's all these studies out there saying that uh people who generally are angry and have gang-related problems and are fighting and are criminals usually have lower iqs people who are afraid when you become afraid your iq automatically goes down you lose a couple of points when you get really scared also when you get really angry you lose a couple of points you know it's briefly that's why people who get angry do stupid things what happens when you feed a baby from birth fluorinated water and they drink it their whole life haven't you noticed lately that our kids in america or just slightly not normal i have and i'm only 46 years old and i've noticed a huge decline in intelligence in our kids and i believe the world steady on children's iqs america's kids come in way under the mark like a hundred in the world our children that are being fed by by our country fluoride have the lowest iqs in in the world i mean there's a few countries that are lower in ours but i'm not even really sure there's anybody living there anyway these are just my views and they're backed with you know facts and i did talk to an ogbyn who said that she was recommending that babies drink specially high fluorinated water babies teeth fall out and they get new ones wouldn't it make more sense to wait until they were older to drink fluorinated water however fluoride isn't something that's brought in through the body system through digestion it's a topical thing if you go to a dentist the dentist puts it in a cup and sticks it on your teeth it's because it's absorbed through the teeth it's not absorbed through the body by drinking it and what what parts of it is is absorbed through it would require large amounts for it to do anything your teeth uh hence austin texas and then getting the white spots on their teeth look this stuff up it's on the internet i would like everybody to go and stop the fluorination of water and i think that we need to investigate how this stuff got put in and what is behind it now some people say well monty you're just a conspiracy theorist well that may very well be true but at least if i'm a conspiracy theorist then these people over in the harvard university need to be tarred and feathered because they're saying the same thing i am fluoride makes our children a bunch of retards anyways if you have any thoughts about this feel free to uh drop me a message also you know share this information and hit like on there and also uh subscribe thank you have a good day",
