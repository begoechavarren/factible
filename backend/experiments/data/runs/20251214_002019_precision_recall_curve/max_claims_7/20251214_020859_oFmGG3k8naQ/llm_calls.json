    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nhi everyone this is monty i've been doing some investigation into the floor nation of our uh water here in lebanon oregon and i got a letter from the harvard university they posted in the federal government's journal confirms that fluoride lowers iqs and that was on july 27 2012. you can you can most likely find it in uh just by typing in but you can see it's a major harvard university study that confirms that the fluorination of our city water lowers our children's iq now you would think that that would cause writing in the streets demanding that we would have fluoride removed from our water but ironically it doesn't another study this one done by harvard university on july 26th that says it was published in the national institute of health journal finds that fluoride lowers children's iq that's the florida nation of your city water and this is the article right here again it's a harvard university study now both of those were done in this year and you would think that as soon as the american people found out for sure through harvard university after they've done extensive studies that the fluoridation of our water supply causes our children redox retardation making our children's iqs lower causing problems and and families and health you think that people would uh be freaking out and getting the flu right out you think we wouldn't even have to ask our governments and our townships to remove the fluoride fluoride from our water they don't do it you have to fight tooth and now and chances are they're sterile aren't going to do it but if you're not worried about lowering iqs you know everybody says oh my kid's stupid you know we're used to hearing it but here's another release published in april 5th 2006 another one from harvard university studies shows a link between fluorinated water and bone cancer in boys so you know it just goes on and on it's just link after link all of these studies from harvard university uh not to mention the 3600 000 other studies that have been done by numerous people that just plagues this whole fluoridation of water and that people aren't doing anything about it they're not stopping it why is this being put in our water when it is causing the iqs of our children to be lowered causing uh all kinds of problems now here's a great thing me and my girl went to see her obgyn the other day and she had some work done on her while i was in the office i was talking to this specialist with women and children this lady is a doctor who specializes in child rearing and and women issues and stuff and i asked her what she knew about fluoride and she said that she strongly recommends that babies be fed special water that has been specially more foreign more fluorination put in the baby's water for the use of their uh for for their feedings and i asked her if she looked into it she said she felt some concerns about the recent stories of uh you know how fluoride is linked in in brain damage and she she said she hadn't really looked into it too much and i said well i just got you know i told her the story i just got this information on july 26 27th that uh from harvard saying that they definitely have confirmed it does lower uh children's iq and she said for years she'd been telling mothers of newborn babies to buy fluorinated water to feed their babies to put in their babies bottles so that their baby's teeth would be better and stronger well here's an interesting note the nurse that was helping this doctor says hey wait a minute uh i come from austin texas and they have natural fluorination of the water there where the water is over fluorinated and everybody in the town all the town of 300 000 people have white pitted stuff on their teeth and uh she said and everybody in the town acts literally like a bunch of dumbasses those are her words not mine she said that it's just a bunch of hooligans and everybody's kind of hillbilly mentality real low iq individuals and of course their waters naturally overflowed fluorinated it's called uh fluorination opmosis or something like that when you have too much fluorine in your body you get uh white spots on your teeth now here's just a thought if you know anybody with white spots on their teeth ask them a couple of simple questions and see if they're a dumbass because from what i hear from this nurse the people over in austin texas or somewhere around that uh all live in a town where the water has too much fluorine in it naturally and they're all a bunch of dumbasses uh hicks you know she this is her words not mine i i don't know i live in lebanon oregon and uh at any rate get sidetracked here there's all these studies out there saying that uh people who generally are angry and have gang-related problems and are fighting and are criminals usually have lower iqs people who are afraid when you become afraid your iq automatically goes down you lose a couple of points when you get really scared also when you get really angry you lose a couple of points you know it's briefly that's why people who get angry do stupid things what happens when you feed a baby from birth fluorinated water and they drink it their whole life haven't you noticed lately that our kids in america or just slightly not normal i have and i'm only 46 years old and i've noticed a huge decline in intelligence in our kids and i believe the world steady on children's iqs america's kids come in way under the mark like a hundred in the world our children that are being fed by by our country fluoride have the lowest iqs in in the world i mean there's a few countries that are lower in ours but i'm not even really sure there's anybody living there anyway these are just my views and they're backed with you know facts and i did talk to an ogbyn who said that she was recommending that babies drink specially high fluorinated water babies teeth fall out and they get new ones wouldn't it make more sense to wait until they were older to drink fluorinated water however fluoride isn't something that's brought in through the body system through digestion it's a topical thing if you go to a dentist the dentist puts it in a cup and sticks it on your teeth it's because it's absorbed through the teeth it's not absorbed through the body by drinking it and what what parts of it is is absorbed through it would require large amounts for it to do anything your teeth uh hence austin texas and then getting the white spots on their teeth look this stuff up it's on the internet i would like everybody to go and stop the fluorination of water and i think that we need to investigate how this stuff got put in and what is behind it now some people say well monty you're just a conspiracy theorist well that may very well be true but at least if i'm a conspiracy theorist then these people over in the harvard university need to be tarred and feathered because they're saying the same thing i am fluoride makes our children a bunch of retards anyways if you have any thoughts about this feel free to uh drop me a message also you know share this information and hit like on there and also uh subscribe thank you have a good day",

Lesions of the amygdala cause changes in social dominance hierarchies.\n\nFull Page Content:\nPrimary Navigation\nWant to create or adapt books like this? Learn more about how Pressbooks supports open publishing practices.\nBook Contents Navigation\nChapter 9: Anger\nLike with fear, the amygdala is often activated for anger experiences. Lesions of the amygdala cause changes in social dominance hierarchies, such that previously high-status monkeys become lower in status after the lesion (Rosvold et al., 1954). But, other times, Kl\u00fcver -Bucy Syndrome (Kl\u00fcver & Bucy, 1939) in monkeys makes the monkey act tame, even though the situation would typically elicit aggression. Thus, lesions impair the normal anger behavior changes, sometimes resulting in patterns that are opposite the expected patterns for anger. Some recent work is suggesting that the amygdala plays an important role in regulating anger and aggression. Lesions to the human amygdala both increased and decreased aggression (for a review, Haller, 2018; van Elst et al., 2000). Taken together, damage to the amygdala suggests that this structure regulates behavior changes during an anger experience \u2013 either by increasing aggressive approach or down-regulating aggression. Some work (Matthies et al., 2012) has found that amygdala volume and trait aggression are negatively correlated. This means that as the amygdala volume decreases, people exhibit greater levels of an aggressive personality trait. Research on mice, voles, hamsters, and even lizards suggests that different parts of the amygdala may be specific to different types of aggression (for a review, see Haller, 2018). For instance, the medial amygdala is activated for male rivalry aggression to acquire dominance (activated with the intruder test discussed in fear), the central amygdala for predatory aggression, and maternal aggression activated both the medial and central amygdala.\nOne study (Coccaro et al., 2007) compared control participants to participants diagnosed with intermittent explosive disorder (IED), a disorder defined by overly aggressive behaviors. While an fMRI scanned their brain, participants viewed seven of Ekman\u2019s FACS emotional expressions and clicked a button to indicate the gender of the individual in the photo. Results showed that when participants viewed only the ANGRY faces, IED participants exhibited greater activity in the amygdala, but less activity in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), compared to control participants. Does this show anger results in an overactive amygdala and underactive OFC? Maybe! But consider which emotions participants may have been experiencing when viewing the ANGRY face.\nThe orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is located in the prefrontal cortex. The OFC is activated when viewing anger facial expressions, highlighting the role of anger perception (Blair et al., 1999), and this activation increases as the intensity of the anger expression increases. Damage to the OFC is associated with 1) impairment in identifying negative, but not positive emotion facial expressions, 2) difficulty identifying the intensity of emotions on facial expressions, and 3) greater reactive aggression (Blair, 2012; Blair & Cipolotti, 2000; Dal Monte et al., 2013; Heberlein, et al., 2008; Marinkovic et al., 2000; Zald & Andreotti, 2010). A recent study (Willis et al., 2014) found that OFC damaged-patients experienced difficulty recognizing emotions of faces in the first 500 ms that a photo was shown but were able to eventually correctly identify the emotion. These findings suggest that impairments may occur at a more nonconscious level. Studies on normal populations have shown that as the OFC shows greater activation to angry faces, people exhibit reduced aggressive behavior (Beyer et al, 2015). These findings would suggest that for normal functioning individuals, when we experience anger, the OFC helps us to regulate our aggressive approach behaviors.\nActivation of the OFC is negatively correlated with aggressive behavior. But remember when we view an anger expression on another person\u2019s face, that might cause us to experience fear. Taken together, these findings might suggest that the OFC helps us to perceive anger in others, to down-regulate our anger/aggression, and maybe even to engage in fear avoidance. Paralleling findings on the ventral striatum, lesions to the OFC hinder recognition of anger facial expressions and can also increase aggressive behavior. Said another way, if the OFC is not normally operating, then we might fail to perceive anger and our OFC cannot regulate our anger expression.\nIn the study discussed above (Coccaro et al., 2007), IED participants reported reduced OFC activation when viewing angry and happy faces, suggesting underactive OFC relates to positive emotions too.\nIn the 1960\u2019s, Reynolds (1969) accidentally learned that stimulating the PAG in rats allowed him to perform surgery on the rats without using anesthetics. This was the first study to notice the role of the PAG in reducing pain. The PAG also regulates other physiological responses during an emotion, such as the heart rate or blood pressure. Siegel et al. (1999) discusses that electrically stimulating the hypothalamus and PAG results in aggression in cats.\nThe ventral striatum is located in the basal ganglia and is considered part of the brain\u2019s reward circuit. This reward circuit contains high levels of dopamine, so often these structures are activated when people anticipate upcoming rewards. When people recalled and described personal stories of anger, the ventral striatum was activated (Hornak et al., 2003). While describing these stories, participants reported angry subjective feelings, suggesting the ventral striatum is activated when we experience anger. In one study (Hornak et al., 2003), participants recalled times that they felt angry and rated their subjective feelings, all while an fMRI scanned their brain. Findings showed that self-reported feelings of anger were positively correlated with activity in the reward circuit. BUT the problem is that self-reported po\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

In 1945, Grand Rapids, Michigan, became the first community in the world to add fluoride to tap water.

Now with the research from brain neuroscience and using functional MRIs, we can actually understand these phenomena.\nWhen our thinking gets temporally impaired like these examples above, it is like we are operating with 10-15 fewer IQ points. The light goes out in the prefrontal cortex, which is our executive functioning and decision-making region of the brain.\nBrain Freeze\nImagine the fear, complexity, and seriousness of the decisions Japanese leaders needed to make in the wake of the earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear reactor dysfunction. It is easy to have \"information fatigue,\" while critical time lost is adding to the problems.\nWhen there is any fear or anxiety, the amygdala region of the brain, your emotional center, jumps to attention and takes resources away from the executive decision making of the prefrontal cortex. In a chain reaction, the light goes out on the prefrontal cortex, your IQ drains like a cold beer going down on a hot afternoon, and it easier to put off the decision, make a bad decision, or make no decision at all.\nMatthew Lieberman, a neuroscientist has found an inverse relationship between the activation of the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex. When the amygdala is active with blood and oxygen, there is less activation in the prefrontal cortex. Our thinking power is disrupted and there are deficits in our problem-solving because the blood and oxygen are in the amygdala versus the prefrontal cortex.\nLogic is suppressed by the powerful tunnel vision survival reaction of the amygdala. No one can make you do something against your better judgment, but the amygdala always can.\nAny strong emotion, fear, stress, anxiety, anger, joy, or betrayal trips off the amygdala and impairs the prefrontal cortex's working memory. The power of emotions overwhelms rationality. That is why when we are emotionally upset or stressed we can't think straight. The IQ points we need to thoughtfully consider decisions are depleted temporarily.\nNew brain science research from Srinivasan Pillay's new book, Your Brain and Business, reports that even information heard and not consciously registered can activate the amygdala region. The TV in the background giving the latest reports of the Japanese tragedy creates a fear response if heard for 10-30 milliseconds so fast that you can't register it. The brain needs 30 milliseconds for the brain to consciously pick it up. So that unconscious fear and anxiety residing in the amygdala can be blocking critical IQ and decision making resources without you knowing it.\nNow any decision you make today can be complicated and overwhelming when you add websites to check out, friends on Facebook or Twitter's opinions, and the multiple and different reviews. The easiest thing is to put off this decision till you have more energy. Your brain resources to make great decisions are spent.\nIf your multitude of decision considerations are in conflict it also activates the Anterior Cingulate Cortex of the brain which deals with conflict. It then quickly connects to the amygdala and keeps it activated and your IQ in a brain freeze.\nHow to Counteract the Brain Freeze and Gain back your IQ Points?\n1. Give your brain a recess. Think of young kids in school, when the bell rings for recess. They yell and scream with free time. Your mind needs a recess to wander in an unstructured manner. Often in this recess, an idea or solution may emerge to an issue you have been dealing with.\n2. Turn off the TV or radio if you aren't consciously wanting to get news or entertainment. This is so you don't burn critical brain resources by stimulating a fear response without knowing it.\n3. Seed your unconscious. Give your unconscious instructions to work on an issue in the background as you focus on something else.\n4. Clear the deck. Focus on something else for a while or talk to a friend who is positive to change your sense of overwhelm. Allow the prefrontal cortex and your working memory to recharge.\n5. Practice a mindfulness exercise. Focus on your breathing or really stay focused on what you are doing in the moment. Feel your body in space as you sit or move. Meditation, yoga, walking or a massage are ways to allow the prefrontal cortex to recharge gain your IQ points back.\nRead the next post for how you can lose IQ points with anger outbursts.\nFor more information and resources, go to truenorthleadership.com.\nContact: Rnadler@truenorthleadership.com\nCopyright (2011) Relly Nadler, Psy.D.\nRelly Nadler, M.C.C., is a licensed psychologist, author and Master Certified Coach (MCC) for executives and executive teams.\nGet the help you need from a therapist near you\u2013a FREE service from Psychology Today.\nPsychology Today \u00a9 2025 Sussex Publishers, LLC\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

A National Toxicology Program (NTP) study concluded that there was \u201cequivocal evidence\u201d of carcinogenic activity of sodium fluoride in male rats that were given extremely high doses (100 ppm and 175 ppm) for 2 yrs (NTP, 1990). Other animal studies have not provided evidence of an association between fluoride and osteosarcoma (Maurer et al., 1990; NTP, 1992).\nNumerous descriptive studies, with self-reported or ecological level data used to determine fluoride exposure from drinking water, failed to demonstrate an association (Hoover et al., 1976; Doll and Kinlen, 1977, 1978; Newbrun, 1977; Hrudey et al., 1990; Mahoney et al., 1991; Freni and Gaylor, 1992). Similarly, case-control studies have not found any significant association between osteosarcoma risk and fluoridated drinking water (McGuire et al., 1991; Moss et al., 1995) or total lifetime fluoride (Gelberg et al., 1995). One exploratory analysis reported an increased risk among a subset of males exposed to fluoride in drinking water during childhood (Bassin et al., 2006).\nFluoride has an affinity for calcified tissues, with 99% of fluoride in the body contained within the skeleton. Thus, bone fluoride levels can serve as a biomarker for chronic fluoride exposure, providing a more objective measure of fluoride exposure. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether fluoride levels in bone are associated with the occurrence of osteosarcoma.\nPatients were identified by physicians in the orthopedic departments from 9 hospitals across the US between 1993 and 2000. The study sample included incident cases of primary osteosarcoma, including osteoblastic, parosteal, and periosteal subtypes, and two control groups: tumor controls, patients with newly diagnosed malignant bone tumors; and orthopedic controls, surgical patients with benign tumors or non-neoplastic conditions. Since tumor controls were the only ones with available bone specimens for assay, they comprised the control series for this report. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the respective hospitals, Harvard Medical School, and the Medical College of Georgia.\nAll eligible patients who consented to participate were interviewed in person during hospitalization, pre-admission, or post-admission. Medical information was requested for all living patients born in the US. Patients who completed at least 80% of the questionnaire were considered to be enrolled in the study. Although the study protocol called for matching of cases and controls based on gender, age (\u00b1 5 yrs), and distance from their medical center, this approach was abandoned early in the study, since it proved to be a barrier to recruiting controls. Thus, all available tumor patients were recruited, and the statistical analysis was adjusted for age and gender.\nCancer diagnoses were confirmed by pathology reports. Specimens of both the tumor and normal bone adjacent to the margins of tumor tissue, herein referred to as tumor-adjacent bone, were collected from cases and tumor controls during surgery. Given that bone at the tumor site was destroyed as a result of the tumor, tumor-adjacent bone was analyzed for fluoride content. In some centers, a segment of bone from the iliac crest was also requested for cases, to assess the correlation between fluoride in iliac crest bone and in tumor-adjacent bone.\nMethods used to measure fluoride concentration in the bone specimens have been described in detail elsewhere (Medina et al., 2006). A 4- to 6-mg portion of bone was ashed, pulverized, and analyzed for fluoride concentrations (ash weight, mg F/kg, or ppm) according to a method developed by Taves (1968) and modified by Whitford (1996). With blinding to the case or control status of the bone specimens, each specimen was analyzed in duplicate; if measurements differed by more than 10%, another specimen was analyzed. Deer bone specimens with known fluoride concentrations were included in each batch of specimens for quality control (Medina et al., 2006) and confirmed the validity of the bone fluoride assay procedure.\nWe used Chi-square and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests to evaluate differences in patient characteristics and median fluoride concentrations between tumor-adjacent bone and iliac crest bone.

Lesions of the amygdala cause changes in social dominance hierarchies, such that previously high-status monkeys become lower in status after the lesion (Rosvold et al., 1954). But, other times, Kl\u00fcver -Bucy Syndrome (Kl\u00fcver & Bucy, 1939) in monkeys makes the monkey act tame, even though the situation would typically elicit aggression. Thus, lesions impair the normal anger behavior changes, sometimes resulting in patterns that are opposite the expected patterns for anger. Some recent work is suggesting that the amygdala plays an important role in regulating anger and aggression. Lesions to the human amygdala both increased and decreased aggression (for a review, Haller, 2018; van Elst et al., 2000). Taken together, damage to the amygdala suggests that this structure regulates behavior changes during an anger experience \u2013 either by increasing aggressive approach or down-regulating aggression. Some work (Matthies et al., 2012) has found that amygdala volume and trait aggression are negatively correlated. This means that as the amygdala volume decreases, people exhibit greater levels of an aggressive personality trait. Research on mice, voles, hamsters, and even lizards suggests that different parts of the amygdala may be specific to different types of aggression (for a review, see Haller, 2018). For instance, the medial amygdala is activated for male rivalry aggression to acquire dominance (activated with the intruder test discussed in fear), the central amygdala for predatory aggression, and maternal aggression activated both the medial and central amygdala.\nOne study (Coccaro et al., 2007) compared control participants to participants diagnosed with intermittent explosive disorder (IED), a disorder defined by overly aggressive behaviors. While an fMRI scanned their brain, participants viewed seven of Ekman\u2019s FACS emotional expressions and clicked a button to indicate the gender of the individual in the photo. Results showed that when participants viewed only the ANGRY faces, IED participants exhibited greater activity in the amygdala, but less activity in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), compared to control participants. Does this show anger results in an overactive amygdala and underactive OFC? Maybe! But consider which emotions participants may have been experiencing when viewing the ANGRY face.\nThe orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is located in the prefrontal cortex. The OFC is activated when viewing anger facial expressions, highlighting the role of anger perception (Blair et al., 1999), and this activation increases as the intensity of the anger expression increases. Damage to the OFC is associated with 1) impairment in identifying negative, but not positive emotion facial expressions, 2) difficulty identifying the intensity of emotions on facial expressions, and 3) greater reactive aggression (Blair, 2012; Blair & Cipolotti, 2000; Dal Monte et al., 2013; Heberlein, et al., 2008; Marinkovic et al., 2000; Zald & Andreotti, 2010). A recent study (Willis et al., 2014) found that OFC damaged-patients experienced difficulty recognizing emotions of faces in the first 500 ms that a photo was shown but were able to eventually correctly identify the emotion. These findings suggest that impairments may occur at a more nonconscious level. Studies on normal populations have shown that as the OFC shows greater activation to angry faces, people exhibit reduced aggressive behavior (Beyer et al, 2015). These findings would suggest that for normal functioning individuals, when we experience anger, the OFC helps us to regulate our aggressive approach behaviors.\nActivation of the OFC is negatively correlated with aggressive behavior. But remember when we view an anger expression on another person\u2019s face, that might cause us to experience fear. Taken together, these findings might suggest that the OFC helps us to perceive anger in others, to down-regulate our anger/aggression, and maybe even to engage in fear avoidance. Paralleling findings on the ventral striatum, lesions to the OFC hinder recognition of anger facial expressions and can also increase aggressive behavior. Said another way, if the OFC is not normally operating, then we might fail to perceive anger and our OFC cannot regulate our anger expression.\nIn the study discussed above (Coccaro et al., 2007), IED participants reported reduced OFC activation when viewing angry and happy faces, suggesting underactive OFC relates to positive emotions too.\nIn the 1960\u2019s, Reynolds (1969) accidentally learned that stimulating the PAG in rats allowed him to perform surgery on the rats without using anesthetics. This was the first study to notice the role of the PAG in reducing pain. The PAG also regulates other physiological responses during an emotion, such as the heart rate or blood pressure. Siegel et al. (1999) discusses that electrically stimulating the hypothalamus and PAG results in aggression in cats.\nThe ventral striatum is located in the basal ganglia and is considered part of the brain\u2019s reward circuit. This reward circuit contains high levels of dopamine, so often these structures are activated when people anticipate upcoming rewards. When people recalled and described personal stories of anger, the ventral striatum was activated (Hornak et al., 2003). While describing these stories, participants reported angry subjective feelings, suggesting the ventral striatum is activated when we experience anger. In one study (Hornak et al., 2003), participants recalled times that they felt angry and rated their subjective feelings, all while an fMRI scanned their brain. Findings showed that self-reported feelings of anger were positively correlated with activity in the reward circuit. BUT the problem is that self-reported po\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

However, they point out research by Ding (2011) suggested that low water fluoride levels had significant negative associations with children\u2019s intelligence.\nChoi et al. write, \u201cAlthough fluoride may cause neurotoxicity in animal models and acute fluoride poisoning causes neurotoxicity in adults, very little is known of its effects on children\u2019s neurodevelopment. They recommend more brain/fluoride research on children and at individual-level doses.\n\u201cIt\u2019s senseless to keep subjecting our children to this ongoing fluoridation experiment to satisfy the political agenda of special-interest groups,\u201d says attorney Paul Beeber, NYSCOF President. \u201cEven if fluoridation reduced cavities, is tooth health more important than brain health? It\u2019s time to put politics aside and stop artificial fluoridation everywhere,\u201d says Beeber.\nAfter reviewing fluoride toxicological data, the NRC reported in 2006, \u201cIt\u2019s apparent that fluorides have the ability to interfere with the functions of the brain.\u201d\nChoi\u2019s team writes, \u201cFluoride readily crosses the placenta. Fluoride exposure to the developing brain, which is much more susceptible to injury caused by toxicants than is the mature brain, may possibly lead to damage of a permanent nature.\u201d\nFluoride accumulates in the body.

There is a concern, however, that some pregnant women and children may be getting more fluoride than they need because they now get fluoride from many sources including treated public water, water-added foods and beverages, teas, toothpaste, floss, and mouthwash, and the combined total intake of fluoride may exceed safe amounts.\nTherefore, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) conducted a systematic review of the published scientific literature on the association between fluoride exposure and neurodevelopment and cognition. The NTP released their findings in a State of the Science Monograph (available below under Documents). A corresponding meta-analysis on children's IQ was published in JAMA Pediatrics on January 6, 2025 (see sidebar).\nThe NTP started this work in 2016. As with all research documents intended for publication, the NTP fluoride monograph and meta-analysis underwent rigorous scientific evaluation. The evaluation process has involved many steps. The draft fluoride monograph received critical feedback during peer-review by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM), from other external experts, and from experts in several federal health agencies. After modifications were made, additional evaluation following a rigorous scientific framework was conducted by subject matter experts organized by the NTP Board of Scientific Counselors. This document is now complete and available for reference.\nThe monograph represents a thorough review of the data, and the various interpretations of the data, to accurately reflect what we know and where additional research is needed.\nThe NTP monograph concluded, with moderate confidence, that higher levels of fluoride exposure, such as drinking water containing more than 1.5 milligrams of fluoride per liter, are associated with lower IQ in children. The NTP review was designed to evaluate total fluoride exposure from all sources and was not designed to evaluate the health effects of fluoridated drinking water alone. It is important to note that there were insufficient data to determine if the low fluoride level of 0.7 mg/L currently recommended for U.S. community water supplies has a negative effect on children\u2019s IQ. The NTP found no evidence that fluoride exposure had adverse effects on adult cognition.\nThe NTP uses 4 confidence levels - high, moderate, low, or very low - to characterize the strength of scientific evidence that associates a particular health outcome with an exposure. After evaluating studies published through October 2023, the NTP Monograph concluded there is moderate confidence in the scientific evidence that showed an association between higher levels of fluoride and lower IQ in children.\nThe determination about lower IQs in children was based primarily on epidemiology studies in non-U.S. countries such as Canada, China, India, Iran, Pakistan, and Mexico where some pregnant women, infants, and children received total fluoride exposure amounts higher than 1.5 mg fluoride/L of drinking water. The U.S. Public Health Service currently recommends 0.7 mg/L, and the World Health Organization has set a safe limit for fluoride in drinking water of 1.5 mg/L.\nAn association indicates a connection between fluoride and lower IQ; it does not prove a cause and effect. Many substances are healthy and beneficial when taken in small doses but may cause harm at high doses. More research is needed to better understand if there are health risks associated with low fluoride exposures. This NTP monograph may provide important information to regulatory agencies that set standards for the safe use of fluoride. It does not, and was not intended to, assess the benefits of fluoride.\nBoard of Scientific Counselors - BSC Meeting\nBoard of Scientific Counselors - BSC Meeting\nExpert Panels - Other Panels\nExpert Panels - Other Panels\nBoard of Scientific Counselors - BSC Meeting\nSupplemental materials for some events, meetings, and workshops prior to 2021 have been archived.

(NYSCOF)\n\u201cThe children in high fluoride areas had significantly lower IQ than those who lived in low fluoride areas,\u201d write Choi et al.\nFurther, the EPA says fluoride is a chemical \u201cwith substantial evidence of developmental neurotoxicity.\u201d\nFluoride (fluosilicic acid) is added to US water supplies at approximately 1 part per million attempting to reduce tooth decay.\nWater was the only fluoride source in the studies reviewed and was based on high water fluoride levels. However, they point out research by Ding (2011) suggested that low water fluoride levels had significant negative associations with children\u2019s intelligence.\nChoi et al. write, \u201cAlthough fluoride may cause neurotoxicity in animal models and acute fluoride poisoning causes neurotoxicity in adults, very little is known of its effects on children\u2019s neurodevelopment. They recommend more brain/fluoride research on children and at individual-level doses.\n\u201cIt\u2019s senseless to keep subjecting our children to this ongoing fluoridation experiment to satisfy the political agenda of special-interest groups,\u201d says attorney Paul Beeber, NYSCOF President. \u201cEven if fluoridation reduced cavities, is tooth health more important than brain health? It\u2019s time to put politics aside and stop artificial fluoridation everywhere,\u201d says Beeber.\nAfter reviewing fluoride toxicological data, the NRC reported in 2006, \u201cIt\u2019s apparent that fluorides have the ability to interfere with the functions of the brain.\u201d\nChoi\u2019s team writes, \u201cFluoride readily crosses the placenta. Fluoride exposure to the developing brain, which is much more susceptible to injury caused by toxicants than is the mature brain, may possibly lead to damage of a permanent nature.\u201d\nFluoride accumulates in the body. Even low doses are harmful to babies, the thyroid, kidney patients and heavy water-drinkers. There are even doubts about fluoridation\u2019s effectiveness. New York City Legislation is pending to stop fluoridation. Many communities have already stopped.\nInfant formula when mixed with fluoridated water delivers 100-200 times more fluoride than breastmilk. (3)\n\u00a9 2025 American Environmental Health Studies.

Our analysis was limited to cases less than 20 years old. We standardized fluoride exposure estimates based on CDC-recommended target levels that take climate into account. We categorized exposure into three groups (<30%, 30-99%, >99% of target) and used conditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios.\nResults: Analysis is based on 103 cases under the age of 20 and 215 matched controls. For males, the unadjusted odds ratios for higher exposures were greater than 1.0 at each exposure age, reaching a peak of 4.07 (95% CI 1.43, 11.56) at age 7 years for the highest exposure. Adjusting for potential confounders produced similar results with an adjusted odds ratio for males of 5.46 (95% CI 1.50, 19.90) at age 7 years. This association was not apparent among females.\nConclusions: Our exploratory analysis found an association between fluoride exposure in drinking water during childhood and the incidence of osteosarcoma among males but not consistently among females.

The recent article in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Pediatrics \u201cFluoride Exposure and Children\u2019s IQ Scores: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis\u201d consists of the metanalysis left out of the National Toxicology Program\u2019s (NTP) monograph released in August and does not provide any new evidence to warrant changing current community water fluoridation practices.\nAn accompanying commentary, \u201cCaution Needed in Interpreting the Evidence Base on Fluoride and IQ,\u201d by University of Iowa dental professor and international expert on fluoride intake, Steven Levy, D.D.S., M.P.H., cautions that the systematic review and meta-analysis, which contend fluoride exposure can lower children\u2019s IQ levels, are deeply flawed. \u201cWhile I have serious concerns about biases and other methodological flaws in this meta-analysis, the main takeaway is that it did not find any connection between lower IQ and fluoride intake at the level recommended for community water fluoridation,\u201d Dr. Levy\u2019s commentary explains. Dr. Levy is also a member of the ADA\u2019s National Fluoridation Advisory Committee.\n\u201cThe public needs to understand that the levels examined in NTP report are from countries with high levels of naturally occurring fluoride that is more than double the amount recommended by the U.S. Public Health Service to optimally fluoridate community water systems and help prevent dental disease,\u201d said Brett Kessler, D.D.S., president of the American Dental Association. \u201cA more recent study in which the level of fluoride in water is comparable to that in the U.S. found no measurable effect on cognitive neurodevelopment or IQ scores in children. To prevent dental disease the ADA continues to recommend drinking optimally fluoridated water along with twice daily brushing with fluoride toothpaste and eating a healthy diet, low in added sugars,\u201d said Dr. Kessler.\nThe ADA\u2019s National Fluoridation Advisory Committee and other experts concluded the final National Toxicology Program did not adequately address or overcome biases and weaknesses of the studies reviewed as identified from initial NTP draft reports. The report twice failed peer review by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM), required additional scientific review by an NTP Board of Scientific Counselors (BSC), and underwent a significant number of revisions and edits before it was finally released earlier this year.\nThe final NTP report was also considered in a recent District Court case, and the key takeaway from the District Court ruling is that the final NTP report \u201cdoes not conclude with any certainty that fluoridated water is injurious to public health,\u201d as stated by District Court Judge Edward Chen.\n\u201cAs a science-based organization with health care professionals dedicated to improving the oral and overall health of the public, the ADA welcomes future U.S.-based research and data relevant to this country\u2019s practice of fluoridating water,\u201d Dr. Kessler states. \u201cThe ADA has yet to see any peer-reviewed published research that would alter its long-standing position that optimally fluoridated water is beneficial and safe for the oral health of the public.\u201d\nFor more information on community water fluoridation and ADA advocacy, visit ADA.org/fluoride.\nAbout the American Dental Association The not-for-profit ADA is the nation's largest dental association, representing 154,000 dentist members.

There is a concern, however, that some pregnant women and children may be getting more fluoride than they need because they now get fluoride from many sources including treated public water, water-added foods and beverages, teas, toothpaste, floss, and mouthwash, and the combined total intake of fluoride may exceed safe amounts.\nTherefore, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) conducted a systematic review of the published scientific literature on the association between fluoride exposure and neurodevelopment and cognition. The NTP released their findings in a State of the Science Monograph (available below under Documents). A corresponding meta-analysis on children's IQ was published in JAMA Pediatrics on January 6, 2025 (see sidebar).\nThe NTP started this work in 2016. As with all research documents intended for publication, the NTP fluoride monograph and meta-analysis underwent rigorous scientific evaluation. The evaluation process has involved many steps. The draft fluoride monograph received critical feedback during peer-review by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM), from other external experts, and from experts in several federal health agencies. After modifications were made, additional evaluation following a rigorous scientific framework was conducted by subject matter experts organized by the NTP Board of Scientific Counselors. This document is now complete and available for reference.\nThe monograph represents a thorough review of the data, and the various interpretations of the data, to accurately reflect what we know and where additional research is needed.\nThe NTP monograph concluded, with moderate confidence, that higher levels of fluoride exposure, such as drinking water containing more than 1.5 milligrams of fluoride per liter, are associated with lower IQ in children. The NTP review was designed to evaluate total fluoride exposure from all sources and was not designed to evaluate the health effects of fluoridated drinking water alone. It is important to note that there were insufficient data to determine if the low fluoride level of 0.7 mg/L currently recommended for U.S. community water supplies has a negative effect on children\u2019s IQ. The NTP found no evidence that fluoride exposure had adverse effects on adult cognition.\nThe NTP uses 4 confidence levels - high, moderate, low, or very low - to characterize the strength of scientific evidence that associates a particular health outcome with an exposure. After evaluating studies published through October 2023, the NTP Monograph concluded there is moderate confidence in the scientific evidence that showed an association between higher levels of fluoride and lower IQ in children.\nThe determination about lower IQs in children was based primarily on epidemiology studies in non-U.S. countries such as Canada, China, India, Iran, Pakistan, and Mexico where some pregnant women, infants, and children received total fluoride exposure amounts higher than 1.5 mg fluoride/L of drinking water. The U.S. Public Health Service currently recommends 0.7 mg/L, and the World Health Organization has set a safe limit for fluoride in drinking water of 1.5 mg/L.\nAn association indicates a connection between fluoride and lower IQ; it does not prove a cause and effect. Many substances are healthy and beneficial when taken in small doses but may cause harm at high doses. More research is needed to better understand if there are health risks associated with low fluoride exposures.

Dr. Levy is also a member of the ADA\u2019s National Fluoridation Advisory Committee.\n\u201cThe public needs to understand that the levels examined in NTP report are from countries with high levels of naturally occurring fluoride that is more than double the amount recommended by the U.S. Public Health Service to optimally fluoridate community water systems and help prevent dental disease,\u201d said Brett Kessler, D.D.S., president of the American Dental Association. \u201cA more recent study in which the level of fluoride in water is comparable to that in the U.S. found no measurable effect on cognitive neurodevelopment or IQ scores in children. To prevent dental disease the ADA continues to recommend drinking optimally fluoridated water along with twice daily brushing with fluoride toothpaste and eating a healthy diet, low in added sugars,\u201d said Dr. Kessler.\nThe ADA\u2019s National Fluoridation Advisory Committee and other experts concluded the final National Toxicology Program did not adequately address or overcome biases and weaknesses of the studies reviewed as identified from initial NTP draft reports. The report twice failed peer review by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM), required additional scientific review by an NTP Board of Scientific Counselors (BSC), and underwent a significant number of revisions and edits before it was finally released earlier this year.\nThe final NTP report was also considered in a recent District Court case, and the key takeaway from the District Court ruling is that the final NTP report \u201cdoes not conclude with any certainty that fluoridated water is injurious to public health,\u201d as stated by District Court Judge Edward Chen.\n\u201cAs a science-based organization with health care professionals dedicated to improving the oral and overall health of the public, the ADA welcomes future U.S.-based research and data relevant to this country\u2019s practice of fluoridating water,\u201d Dr. Kessler states. \u201cThe ADA has yet to see any peer-reviewed published research that would alter its long-standing position that optimally fluoridated water is beneficial and safe for the oral health of the public.\u201d\nFor more information on community water fluoridation and ADA advocacy, visit ADA.org/fluoride.\nAbout the American Dental Association The not-for-profit ADA is the nation's largest dental association, representing 154,000 dentist members.

The purpose of this study was to determine if bone fluoride levels are higher in individuals with osteosarcoma. Incident cases of osteosarcoma (N = 137) and tumor controls (N = 51) were identified by orthopedic physicians, and segments of tumor-adjacent bone and iliac crest bone were analyzed for fluoride content. Logistic regression adjusted for age and sex and potential confounders of osteosarcoma was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). There was no significant difference in bone fluoride levels between cases and controls. The OR adjusted for age, gender, and a history of broken bones was 1.33 (95% CI: 0.56-3.15). No significant association between bone fluoride levels and osteosarcoma risk was detected in our case-control study, based on controls with other tumor diagnoses.\nKeywords: fluoride, osteosarcoma, case-control study, bone, oncology, epidemiology\nOsteosarcoma, a rare, painful, primary malignant bone tumor, is more prevalent in males (Homa et al., 1991), in the long bones (Patel and Benjamin, 2005), and in individuals < 20 yrs old (Gurney et al., 1999).\nChemicals and genetic factors have been suggested as risk factors of osteosarcoma (Miller et al., 1996), while ionizing radiation is the only documented environmental risk factor for bone cancer (Steiner, 1965; Tucker et al., 1987). A National Toxicology Program (NTP) study concluded that there was \u201cequivocal evidence\u201d of carcinogenic activity of sodium fluoride in male rats that were given extremely high doses (100 ppm and 175 ppm) for 2 yrs (NTP, 1990). Other animal studies have not provided evidence of an association between fluoride and osteosarcoma (Maurer et al., 1990; NTP, 1992).\nNumerous descriptive studies, with self-reported or ecological level data used to determine fluoride exposure from drinking water, failed to demonstrate an association (Hoover et al., 1976; Doll and Kinlen, 1977, 1978; Newbrun, 1977; Hrudey et al., 1990; Mahoney et al., 1991; Freni and Gaylor, 1992). Similarly, case-control studies have not found any significant association between osteosarcoma risk and fluoridated drinking water (McGuire et al., 1991; Moss et al., 1995) or total lifetime fluoride (Gelberg et al., 1995). One exploratory analysis reported an increased risk among a subset of males exposed to fluoride in drinking water during childhood (Bassin et al., 2006).\nFluoride has an affinity for calcified tissues, with 99% of fluoride in the body contained within the skeleton. Thus, bone fluoride levels can serve as a biomarker for chronic fluoride exposure, providing a more objective measure of fluoride exposure. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether fluoride levels in bone are associated with the occurrence of osteosarcoma.\nPatients were identified by physicians in the orthopedic departments from 9 hospitals across the US between 1993 and 2000. The study sample included incident cases of primary osteosarcoma, including osteoblastic, parosteal, and periosteal subtypes, and two control groups: tumor controls, patients with newly diagnosed malignant bone tumors; and orthopedic controls, surgical patients with benign tumors or non-neoplastic conditions. Since tumor controls were the only ones with available bone specimens for assay, they comprised the control series for this report. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the respective hospitals, Harvard Medical School, and the Medical College of Georgia.\nAll eligible patients who consented to participate were interviewed in person during hospitalization, pre-admission, or post-admission. Medical information was requested for all living patients born in the US. Patients who completed at least 80% of the questionnaire were considered to be enrolled in the study. Although the study protocol called for matching of cases and controls based on gender, age (\u00b1 5 yrs), and distance from their medical center, this approach was abandoned early in the study, since it proved to be a barrier to recruiting controls. Thus, all available tumor patients were recruited, and the statistical analysis was adjusted for age and gender.\nCancer diagnoses were confirmed by pathology reports. Specimens of both the tumor and normal bone adjacent to the margins of tumor tissue, herein referred to as tumor-adjacent bone, were collected from cases and tumor controls during surgery. Given that bone at the tumor site was destroyed as a result of the tumor, tumor-adjacent bone was analyzed for fluoride content. In some centers, a segment of bone from the iliac crest was also requested for cases, to assess the correlation between fluoride in iliac crest bone and in tumor-adjacent bone.\nMethods used to measure fluoride concentration in the bone specimens have been described in detail elsewhere (Medina et al., 2006). A 4- to 6-mg portion of bone was ashed, pulverized, and analyzed for fluoride concentrations (ash weight, mg F/kg, or ppm) according to a method developed by Taves (1968) and modified by Whitford (1996). With blinding to the case or control status of the bone specimens, each specimen was analyzed in duplicate; if measurements differed by more than 10%, another specimen was analyzed. Deer bone specimens with known fluoride concentrations were included in each batch of specimens for quality control (Medina et al., 2006) and confirmed the validity of the bone fluoride assay procedure.\nWe used Chi-square and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests to evaluate differences in patient characteristics and median fluoride concentrations between tumor-adjacent bone and iliac crest bone. We also evaluated all specimens of tumor-adjacent bone and iliac crest bone among the cases, taking into account the within-person correlation for those patients who had both types of bone specimens. We used Spearman\u2019s correlation to assess the correlation between fl\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The report was a long time coming. NPR's Pien Huang has this story.\nPIEN HUANG, BYLINE: It's hefty, it's over 300 pages long and it comes from the National Toxicology Program, which is part of the National Institutes of Health. Ashley Malin studies toxic exposures at the University of Florida. She did not help write the report, but she does support it.\nASHLEY MALIN: I think it is the most comprehensive and rigorously conducted report of its kind and so important for our understanding of impacts of fluoride exposure on child IQ.\nHUANG: The report addresses concerns that have been circulating for a while. Linda Birnbaum is a toxicologist and former head of the National Toxicology Program.\nLINDA BIRNBAUM: The question was, is fluoride a developmental neurotoxicant? And the analysis clearly said it certainly has the potential to be.\nHUANG: The authors of the report gathered animal and human studies from around the world and weighed the available evidence. They conclude with moderate confidence that there is an association between higher levels of fluoride and lower IQ in children. The report didn't quantify the effects, but some of the studies they included showed a decrease of a few IQ points.\nNow, by higher levels of fluoride, they mean 1.5 milligrams per liter or more. This applies to about 2 million people in the U.S. who live in places where high levels of fluoride naturally occur in the soil and rocks. That level is twice as high as what's added to the public drinking water in many places to prevent cavities, and the report does not address whether lower fluoride exposures come with health risks. Still, Birnbaum says concerns from fluoride advocates delayed the report's publication for several years.\nBIRNBAUM: There was a great deal of concern raised, especially by the dental community, and they were concerned that this report would be misconstrued to say that any fluoridation of drinking water is a problem.\nHUANG: The report kept getting sent between inside and outside committees for review. Howard Pollick is a dentist and spokesman for the American Dental Association. He critiqued earlier drafts of the report, and he says he's OK with the final version for now.\nHOWARD POLLICK: This is not conclusive evidence. They didn't indicate it was conclusive evidence, and so more studies need to be done.\nHUANG: The report itself calls for more research into how fluoride could affect brain development and whether it has an effect at lower levels. Some, like Birnbaum and Malin, think there's already reason to tell those who are pregnant or who care for babies to reduce their fluoride intake. Pollick thinks these calls are premature.\nPOLLICK: Especially when you've got a proven method of preventing a potentially very serious disease, tooth decay, you need a lot more evidence.\nHUANG: Now that this report is finally out, it may open up more funding and research.\nPien Huang, NPR News.\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 NPR.

NPR's Pien Huang has this story.\nPIEN HUANG, BYLINE: It's hefty, it's over 300 pages long and it comes from the National Toxicology Program, which is part of the National Institutes of Health. Ashley Malin studies toxic exposures at the University of Florida. She did not help write the report, but she does support it.\nASHLEY MALIN: I think it is the most comprehensive and rigorously conducted report of its kind and so important for our understanding of impacts of fluoride exposure on child IQ.\nHUANG: The report addresses concerns that have been circulating for a while. Linda Birnbaum is a toxicologist and former head of the National Toxicology Program.\nLINDA BIRNBAUM: The question was, is fluoride a developmental neurotoxicant? And the analysis clearly said it certainly has the potential to be.\nHUANG: The authors of the report gathered animal and human studies from around the world and weighed the available evidence. They conclude with moderate confidence that there is an association between higher levels of fluoride and lower IQ in children. The report didn't quantify the effects, but some of the studies they included showed a decrease of a few IQ points.\nNow, by higher levels of fluoride, they mean 1.5 milligrams per liter or more. This applies to about 2 million people in the U.S. who live in places where high levels of fluoride naturally occur in the soil and rocks. That level is twice as high as what's added to the public drinking water in many places to prevent cavities, and the report does not address whether lower fluoride exposures come with health risks. Still, Birnbaum says concerns from fluoride advocates delayed the report's publication for several years.\nBIRNBAUM: There was a great deal of concern raised, especially by the dental community, and they were concerned that this report would be misconstrued to say that any fluoridation of drinking water is a problem.\nHUANG: The report kept getting sent between inside and outside committees for review. Howard Pollick is a dentist and spokesman for the American Dental Association. He critiqued earlier drafts of the report, and he says he's OK with the final version for now.\nHOWARD POLLICK: This is not conclusive evidence. They didn't indicate it was conclusive evidence, and so more studies need to be done.\nHUANG: The report itself calls for more research into how fluoride could affect brain development and whether it has an effect at lower levels. Some, like Birnbaum and Malin, think there's already reason to tell those who are pregnant or who care for babies to reduce their fluoride intake. Pollick thinks these calls are premature.\nPOLLICK: Especially when you've got a proven method of preventing a potentially very serious disease, tooth decay, you need a lot more evidence.\nHUANG: Now that this report is finally out, it may open up more funding and research.\nPien Huang, NPR News.\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 NPR.

The research, ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nA rigorous nine-year research review looking at the relationship between fluoride and intelligence in children concludes that as fluoride levels rise, IQ drops.\nEvery 1 part per million increase in fluoride in urine \u2014 a way of measuring all the sources of fluoride a person consumes \u2014 was associated with a roughly 1 point drop in a child\u2019s IQ score, the review concluded.\nAlthough an impact like that may seem small for any one person, on a wider scale, the study authors note, the consequences are significant, especially for those who are vulnerable because of risk factors like poverty and nutrition.\n\u201cA 5-point decrease in a population\u2019s IQ would nearly double the number of people classified as intellectually disabled,\u201d they write in their conclusions.\nThe study, which was published Monday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, comes with a backstory. It was conducted by scientists at the government\u2019s National Toxicology Program, which evaluates chemicals and other things people are exposed to, like cell phone radiation, for their potential to harm health. It began in 2015 and was subject to several rounds of reviews in a process that some critics charge was designed to delay its public release.\nRELATED ARTICLE What to know about fluoride in drinking water\nThe full review was finally published as a lengthy monograph in August, and in September, the study became the basis of a federal judge\u2019s ruling ordering the US Environmental Protection Agency to further regulate fluoride to protect children\u2019s intellectual development.\n\u201cSimply put, the risk to health at exposure levels in United States drinking water is sufficiently high to trigger regulatory response by the EPA\u201d under federal law, US District Judge Edward Chen wrote in the ruling.\nIn November, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick for US Health and Human Services secretary, made headlines after he called fluoride \u201can industrial waste\u201d and pledged that the Trump administration would advise utilities to stop adding to public water supplies.\nFluoride is a naturally occurring mineral that\u2019s found in soil, rocks and water to varying degrees. It is also a byproduct of fertilizer production. On the recommendation of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, many cities have added fluoride to their treated drinking water for decades to protect teeth from cavities.\nAs it washes over teeth, fluoride can stop early decay by putting minerals back into tooth enamel. It also makes teeth more resistant to acid and interferes with bacteria\u2019s ability erode teeth.\nIn some places, including areas that have well water that\u2019s naturally high in fluoride, children were getting so much fluoride that it left streaks and spots on their teeth, a condition called dental fluorosis. In 2015, HHS lowered its recommended levels for fluoride in drinking water from a range of 0.7 parts per million to 1.2 parts per million to 0.7 parts per million, to prevent fluorosis.\nThe CDC reiterated its faith in the health benefits of fluoride in 2015, naming water fluoridation one of the \u201c10 Greatest Public Health Achievements of the 21st Century.\u201d\nNow, though, environmental health experts say health agencies need to reassess the risks and benefits of fluoride, because of its potential neurotoxicity.\n\u201cThe evidence is sufficient. It\u2019s not definitive,\u201d says Dr. Bruce Lanphear, an epidemiologist and professor at Simon Fraser University in Canada. Lanphear wrote a commentary on the new paper, and one of his studies was included in the review, but he was not involved in the report\u2019s conclusions.\n\u201cWe need to pause,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to review the evidence, rather than just stick their head in the sand.\u201d\nIn a separate commentary on the study, Dr. Steven Levy, a professor of preventive and community dentistry at the University of Iowa, questions the conclusions of the research and the way JAMA Pediatrics is presenting them, since the study itself doesn\u2019t talk about the rounds of reviews and the delay in its public release.\nLevy says that just publishing the meta-analysis of human studies doesn\u2019t give readers important context about animal studies conducted by the National Toxicology Program, which found no apparent decrease in learning and memory in rodents exposed to low to moderate fluoride levels. He points out that all of the human studies included in the review were from countries outside the US and that the majority are classified by the study authors as having a high risk of bias.\n\u201cThus, despite the presentation of some evidence of a possible association between IQ and high fluoride levels in water, there is no evidence of an adverse effect at the lower fluoride levels commonly used in [community water fluoridation] systems,\u201d he wrote.\nThe study authors agree with him on that point.\nIn a statement, they say they didn\u2019t have enough data to know whether the level of fluoride that\u2019s recommended for drinking water has any effect on children\u2019s IQ.\nThe new review includes 74 studies from 10 countries. Most of the studies \u2013 45 \u2013 come from China, where researchers first noticed differences in intelligence between communities exposed to high fluoride levels and those that were not.\nResearchers then picked apart the methods of each study, looking at factors like the age of the children who were involved, how they were tested for intelligence and how researchers measured their exposure to fluoride, whether they estimated it from less exact metrics like amount of fluoride in the water where they lived, or whether it came from more precise measures such as lab testing fluoride in urine.\nSome of the strongest studies, from Canada and Mexico, looked at measures of fluoride in the urine of pregnant women and then tested the IQ of their children years later.\nRELATED ARTICLE RFK Jr. says fluoride is \u2018an industrial waste\u2019 linked to cancer, diseases and disorders.

There is a concern, however, that some pregnant women and children may be getting more fluoride than they need because they now get fluoride from many sources including treated public water, water-added foods and beverages, teas, toothpaste, floss, and mouthwash, and the combined total intake of fluoride may exceed safe amounts.\nTherefore, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) conducted a systematic review of the published scientific literature on the association between fluoride exposure and neurodevelopment and cognition. The NTP released their findings in a State of the Science Monograph (available below under Documents). A corresponding meta-analysis on children's IQ was published in JAMA Pediatrics on January 6, 2025 (see sidebar).\nThe NTP started this work in 2016. As with all research documents intended for publication, the NTP fluoride monograph and meta-analysis underwent rigorous scientific evaluation. The evaluation process has involved many steps. The draft fluoride monograph received critical feedback during peer-review by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM), from other external experts, and from experts in several federal health agencies. After modifications were made, additional evaluation following a rigorous scientific framework was conducted by subject matter experts organized by the NTP Board of Scientific Counselors. This document is now complete and available for reference.\nThe monograph represents a thorough review of the data, and the various interpretations of the data, to accurately reflect what we know and where additional research is needed.\nThe NTP monograph concluded, with moderate confidence, that higher levels of fluoride exposure, such as drinking water containing more than 1.5 milligrams of fluoride per liter, are associated with lower IQ in children. The NTP review was designed to evaluate total fluoride exposure from all sources and was not designed to evaluate the health effects of fluoridated drinking water alone. It is important to note that there were insufficient data to determine if the low fluoride level of 0.7 mg/L currently recommended for U.S. community water supplies has a negative effect on children\u2019s IQ. The NTP found no evidence that fluoride exposure had adverse effects on adult cognition.\nThe NTP uses 4 confidence levels - high, moderate, low, or very low - to characterize the strength of scientific evidence that associates a particular health outcome with an exposure. After evaluating studies published through October 2023, the NTP Monograph concluded there is moderate confidence in the scientific evidence that showed an association between higher levels of fluoride and lower IQ in children.\nThe determination about lower IQs in children was based primarily on epidemiology studies in non-U.S. countries such as Canada, China, India, Iran, Pakistan, and Mexico where some pregnant women, infants, and children received total fluoride exposure amounts higher than 1.5 mg fluoride/L of drinking water. The U.S. Public Health Service currently recommends 0.7 mg/L, and the World Health Organization has set a safe limit for fluoride in drinking water of 1.5 mg/L.\nAn association indicates a connection between fluoride and lower IQ; it does not prove a cause and effect. Many substances are healthy and beneficial when taken in small doses but may cause harm at high doses. More research is needed to better understand if there are health risks associated with low fluoride exposures. This NTP monograph may provide important information to regulatory agencies that set standards for the safe use of fluoride. It does not, and was not intended to, assess the benefits of fluoride.\nBoard of Scientific Counselors - BSC Meeting\nBoard of Scientific Counselors - BSC Meeting\nExpert Panels - Other Panels\nExpert Panels - Other Panels\nBoard of Scientific Counselors - BSC Meeting\nSupplemental materials for some events, meetings, and workshops prior to 2021 have been archived.

The purpose of this study was to determine if bone fluoride levels are higher in individuals with osteosarcoma. Incident cases of osteosarcoma (N = 137) and tumor controls (N = 51) were identified by orthopedic physicians, and segments of tumor-adjacent bone and iliac crest bone were analyzed for fluoride content. Logistic regression adjusted for age and sex and potential confounders of osteosarcoma was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). There was no significant difference in bone fluoride levels between cases and controls. The OR adjusted for age, gender, and a history of broken bones was 1.33 (95% CI: 0.56-3.15). No significant association between bone fluoride levels and osteosarcoma risk was detected in our case-control study, based on controls with other tumor diagnoses.\nKeywords: fluoride, osteosarcoma, case-control study, bone, oncology, epidemiology\nOsteosarcoma, a rare, painful, primary malignant bone tumor, is more prevalent in males (Homa et al., 1991), in the long bones (Patel and Benjamin, 2005), and in individuals < 20 yrs old (Gurney et al., 1999).\nChemicals and genetic factors have been suggested as risk factors of osteosarcoma (Miller et al., 1996), while ionizing radiation is the only documented environmental risk factor for bone cancer (Steiner, 1965; Tucker et al., 1987). A National Toxicology Program (NTP) study concluded that there was \u201cequivocal evidence\u201d of carcinogenic activity of sodium fluoride in male rats that were given extremely high doses (100 ppm and 175 ppm) for 2 yrs (NTP, 1990). Other animal studies have not provided evidence of an association between fluoride and osteosarcoma (Maurer et al., 1990; NTP, 1992).\nNumerous descriptive studies, with self-reported or ecological level data used to determine fluoride exposure from drinking water, failed to demonstrate an association (Hoover et al., 1976; Doll and Kinlen, 1977, 1978; Newbrun, 1977; Hrudey et al., 1990; Mahoney et al., 1991; Freni and Gaylor, 1992). Similarly, case-control studies have not found any significant association between osteosarcoma risk and fluoridated drinking water (McGuire et al., 1991; Moss et al., 1995) or total lifetime fluoride (Gelberg et al., 1995). One exploratory analysis reported an increased risk among a subset of males exposed to fluoride in drinking water during childhood (Bassin et al., 2006).\nFluoride has an affinity for calcified tissues, with 99% of fluoride in the body contained within the skeleton. Thus, bone fluoride levels can serve as a biomarker for chronic fluoride exposure, providing a more objective measure of fluoride exposure. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether fluoride levels in bone are associated with the occurrence of osteosarcoma.\nPatients were identified by physicians in the orthopedic departments from 9 hospitals across the US between 1993 and 2000. The study sample included incident cases of primary osteosarcoma, including osteoblastic, parosteal, and periosteal subtypes, and two control groups: tumor controls, patients with newly diagnosed malignant bone tumors; and orthopedic controls, surgical patients with benign tumors or non-neoplastic conditions. Since tumor controls were the only ones with available bone specimens for assay, they comprised the control series for this report. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the respective hospitals, Harvard Medical School, and the Medical College of Georgia.\nAll eligible patients who consented to participate were interviewed in person during hospitalization, pre-admission, or post-admission. Medical information was requested for all living patients born in the US. Patients who completed at least 80% of the questionnaire were considered to be enrolled in the study. Although the study protocol called for matching of cases and controls based on gender, age (\u00b1 5 yrs), and distance from their medical center, this approach was abandoned early in the study, since it proved to be a barrier to recruiting controls. Thus, all available tumor patients were recruited, and the statistical analysis was adjusted for age and gender.\nCancer diagnoses were confirmed by pathology reports. Specimens of both the tumor and normal bone adjacent to the margins of tumor tissue, herein referred to as tumor-adjacent bone, were collected from cases and tumor controls during surgery. Given that bone at the tumor site was destroyed as a result of the tumor, tumor-adjacent bone was analyzed for fluoride content. In some centers, a segment of bone from the iliac crest was also requested for cases, to assess the correlation between fluoride in iliac crest bone and in tumor-adjacent bone.\nMethods used to measure fluoride concentration in the bone specimens have been described in detail elsewhere (Medina et al., 2006). A 4- to 6-mg portion of bone was ashed, pulverized, and analyzed for fluoride concentrations (ash weight, mg F/kg, or ppm) according to a method developed by Taves (1968) and modified by Whitford (1996). With blinding to the case or control status of the bone specimens, each specimen was analyzed in duplicate; if measurements differed by more than 10%, another specimen was analyzed. Deer bone specimens with known fluoride concentrations were included in each batch of specimens for quality control (Medina et al., 2006) and confirmed the validity of the bone fluoride assay procedure.\nWe used Chi-square and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests to evaluate differences in patient characteristics and median fluoride concentrations between tumor-adjacent bone and iliac crest bone. We also evaluated all specimens of tumor-adjacent bone and iliac crest bone among the cases, taking into account the within-person correlation for those patients who had both types of bone specimens. We used Spearman\u2019s correlation to assess the correlation between fl\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Analysis of 59 studies with group-level measures of ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nSince 1945, the use of fluoride has been a successful public health initiative for reducing dental cavities and improving general oral health of adults and children. There is a concern, however, that some pregnant women and children may be getting more fluoride than they need because they now get fluoride from many sources including treated public water, water-added foods and beverages, teas, toothpaste, floss, and mouthwash, and the combined total intake of fluoride may exceed safe amounts.\nTherefore, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) conducted a systematic review of the published scientific literature on the association between fluoride exposure and neurodevelopment and cognition. The NTP released their findings in a State of the Science Monograph (available below under Documents). A corresponding meta-analysis on children's IQ was published in JAMA Pediatrics on January 6, 2025 (see sidebar).\nThe NTP started this work in 2016. As with all research documents intended for publication, the NTP fluoride monograph and meta-analysis underwent rigorous scientific evaluation. The evaluation process has involved many steps. The draft fluoride monograph received critical feedback during peer-review by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM), from other external experts, and from experts in several federal health agencies. After modifications were made, additional evaluation following a rigorous scientific framework was conducted by subject matter experts organized by the NTP Board of Scientific Counselors. This document is now complete and available for reference.\nThe monograph represents a thorough review of the data, and the various interpretations of the data, to accurately reflect what we know and where additional research is needed.\nThe NTP monograph concluded, with moderate confidence, that higher levels of fluoride exposure, such as drinking water containing more than 1.5 milligrams of fluoride per liter, are associated with lower IQ in children. The NTP review was designed to evaluate total fluoride exposure from all sources and was not designed to evaluate the health effects of fluoridated drinking water alone. It is important to note that there were insufficient data to determine if the low fluoride level of 0.7 mg/L currently recommended for U.S. community water supplies has a negative effect on children\u2019s IQ. The NTP found no evidence that fluoride exposure had adverse effects on adult cognition.\nThe NTP uses 4 confidence levels - high, moderate, low, or very low - to characterize the strength of scientific evidence that associates a particular health outcome with an exposure. After evaluating studies published through October 2023, the NTP Monograph concluded there is moderate confidence in the scientific evidence that showed an association between higher levels of fluoride and lower IQ in children.\nThe determination about lower IQs in children was based primarily on epidemiology studies in non-U.S. countries such as Canada, China, India, Iran, Pakistan, and Mexico where some pregnant women, infants, and children received total fluoride exposure amounts higher than 1.5 mg fluoride/L of drinking water. The U.S. Public Health Service currently recommends 0.7 mg/L, and the World Health Organization has set a safe limit for fluoride in drinking water of 1.5 mg/L.\nAn association indicates a connection between fluoride and lower IQ; it does not prove a cause and effect. Many substances are healthy and beneficial when taken in small doses but may cause harm at high doses. More research is needed to better understand if there are health risks associated with low fluoride exposures. This NTP monograph may provide important information to regulatory agencies that set standards for the safe use of fluoride. It does not, and was not intended to, assess the benefits of fluoride.\nBoard of Scientific Counselors - BSC Meeting\nBoard of Scientific Counselors - BSC Meeting\nExpert Panels - Other Panels\nExpert Panels - Other Panels\nBoard of Scientific Counselors - BSC Meeting\nSupplemental materials for some events, meetings, and workshops prior to 2021 have been archived.

It is a mineral that is naturally present in varying amounts in almost all foods and water supplies. The benefits of fluoride have been well known for over 50 years and are supported by many health and professional organizations.\nFluoride works in two ways:\nTopical fluoride strengthens the teeth once they have erupted by seeping into the outer surface of the tooth enamel, making the teeth more resistant to decay. We gain topical fluoride by using fluoride containing dental products such as toothpaste, mouth rinses, and gels. Dentists and dental hygienists generally recommend that children have a professional application of fluoride twice a year during dental check-ups.\nSystemic fluoride strengthens the teeth that have erupted as well as those that are developing under the gums. We gain systemic fluoride from most foods and our community water supplies. It is also available as a supplement in drop or gel form and can be prescribed by your dentist or physician. Generally, fluoride drops are recommended for infants, and tablets are best suited for children up through the teen years. It is very important to monitor the amounts of fluoride a child ingests. If too much fluoride is consumed while the teeth are developing, a condition called fluorosis (white spots on the teeth) may result.\nAlthough most people receive fluoride from food and water, sometimes it is not enough to help prevent decay. Your dentist or dental hygienist may recommend the use of home and/or professional fluoride treatments for the following reasons:\nRemember, fluoride alone will not prevent tooth decay! It is important to brush at least twice a day, floss regularly, eat balanced meals, reduce sugary snacks, and visit your dentist on a regular basis.\nWe encourage you to contact us with any questions or comments you may have.

Loc Do, Ph.D., co-author of the study, said factors that could impact the relationship between fluoride and IQ, such as socioeconomic status, were taken into account when determining the results.\nHe added that while there are claims water fluoridation can negatively affect children\u2019s neurodevelopment, \u201cthese results provide consistent evidence this is not the case.\u201d\n\u201cThis population-based follow-up study has provided consistent scientific evidence that early-life exposure to fluoride was not negatively associated with cognitive neurodevelopment.

Boost your emotional intelligence as you find the answers.\n\nFull Page Content:\nPosted March 20, 2021 | Reviewed by Gary Drevitch\nThe desire for mental and physical safety is a core motivational force for all of us. Fortunately, we experience certain emotions that assist us in achieving this goal. Specifically, fear and anger arise when we perceive a threat to our safety\u2013whether related to our resources, those we love, or our overall emotional or physical well-being. A key word here is \u201cperceive\u201d: There is a difference between a genuine threat and one triggered by distorted thoughts or a physiological sensitivity for experiencing threat. While making this distinction is not always easy, doing so provides us the pause we need to respond rather than react to these highly charged emotions.\nFear and anger share some similarities but they are also distinctly different from each other. Fear is most often described as an emotional response that pushes us away from what we currently experience or anticipate experiencing, real or imagined. It may involve both an emotional and physical withdrawal. We may be fearful of external forces as well as those that arise from our inner landscape\u2014our thoughts, feelings, and sensations.\nIn fact, fear of our own emotions is a major contributor to disruptions in our emotional well-being. This is the primary cause of \u201cemotional avoidance\u201d that leads to constriction in emotional flexibility and resilience. Such fear drains our attention and forces us to be guarded\u2013in our thoughts, feelings and behavior\u2013lest we arouse thoughts or feelings that threaten our sense of self.\nFear, like other negative emotions, can trigger our anger. For example, we might feel anger in response to our fear when someone suddenly cuts in front of us while driving down the highway. Similarly, fear of Covid19 can certainly trigger anger toward the virus. Fear of financial pressure can provoke anger with a partner who is perceived as not being frugal.\nWhen excessive, fear can morph into ongoing anxiety that undermines our capacity to be fully present with others and ourselves. Ultimately, it can cripple our capacity to be open to many of life\u2019s experiences.\nWhile fear leads us to feel vulnerable and not in control, anger can be energizing and empowering. As such, it can become the go-to reaction to experiencing fear. Unlike fear, it moves us toward the source of our anger.\nBoth fear and anger trigger our threat system, physiological reactions associated with the \u201cfight-flight or freeze\u201d response. While there is some overlap, these emotions also arouse distinctly different reactions.\nThis was best identified by an early study in which 43 subjects were stimulated to experience fear and anger, while a variety of physiological reactions were recorded (Ax, 1953). These included (1) heart rate, (2) ballistocardiogram, (3) respiration rate, (4) face temperature, (5) hand temperature, (6) skin conductance, and (7) integrated muscle potential. The scores used were the maximum rise and fall from the preceding resting level.\nOf the 14 scores, 7 showed significant discrimination between anger and fear. Diastolic blood pressure rises, heart rate falls, the number of rises in skin conductance and muscle potential were greater for anger than for fear. Additionally, there were greater intercorrelations for anger than for fear, which was interpreted as indicating greater physiological integration during anger.\nA more recent study explored physiological reactions in 183 students and employees of a large university (Moons, Eisenberger and Taylor, 2009). Participant\u2019s baseline levels of anger, fear, cortisol, and two pro-inflammatory markers were assessed at the beginning of a stress session. They then completed the Trier Social Stress Task. This consists of presenting a speech and solving arithmetic problems in front of an audience.\nBaseline anger and fear were related to greater cortisol and the pro-inflammatory markers. Anger reactions to the stressor were associated with increases in cortisol over time but not the pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, fear reactions were associated with increases in stress-related pro-inflammatory cytokines over time and a decrease in cortisol. The study supported the perspective that these distinct emotional experiences appear to trigger physiological processes that mobilize energy in response to anger and promote withdrawal in response to fear.\nBoth fear and anger motivate us, with fear being more powerful in doing so. As such, companies often employ fear in advertising their products. They first instill fear and subsequently identify their product as the best way to alleviate it. Such advertising might state, implicitly or explicitly, that social approval and connection hinges on purchasing a particular brand of product, whether jeans, running shoes or a car.\nPoliticians may similarly use fear, in both their words and images of their campaign. Rather than highlight specific programs or policy they can offer, they may instead point out a fearful scenario as an outcome for not voting for them. When extreme, promoting fear and anger is a hallmark strategy used by authoritarian leaders to intensify our sense of threat and subsequently gain power. Additionally, targeting selective groups of \u201cothers\u201d as being responsible for the threat. Once identified, anger and fear support prejudice toward and dehumanizing them. It is no surprise then, that fear and anger can culminate in hostility and aggression.\nBoth fear and anger can hijack and constrict our attention. This reaction is often associated with the \u201cfight, flight, or freeze\u201d mode. Such narrowing of attention is powerfully revealed in both tunnel vision and auditory exclusion, two reactions reported by police officers involved in shootings. During tunnel vision, attention focuses on the target while the peripheral vision becomes a blur. And, while training may help reduce these effects, their arousal is less subject to personal will.\nIn one study of 40 college students, it was found that anger and fear \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Emotions can be denoted as the mental state because of the neurophysiological changes. Emotions are related to mood, personality, temperament, and consciousness. People exhibit different emotions in different situations causing changes in cognitive functions. One of the major cognitive functions is the ability to learn, to store the acquired information in the parts of the brain such as the hippocampus, amygdala, cortex, and cerebellum. Learning and memory are affected by different types of emotions. Emotional responses such as fear, depression, and stress have impaired effects on cognitive functions such as learning and memory, whereas optimistic and happy emotions have positive effects on long-term memory. Certain disorders have greater effects on the regions of the brain which are also associated with synaptic plasticity and Learning and Memory(LM). Neuroimaging techniques are involved in studying the changing regions of the brain due to varied emotions and treatment strategies based on the changes observed. There are many drugs, and in advancements, nanotechnology is also utilized in the treatment of such psychiatric disorders. To improve mental health and physical health, emotional balance is most important, and effective care should be provided for people with less emotional quotient and different types of disorders to inhibit cognitive dysfunctions. In this review, emotions and their varied effects on a cognitive function named learning and memory, disorders associated with the defects of learning due to emotional instability, the areas of the brain that are in control of emotions, diagnosis, and treatment strategies for psychiatric disorders dependent on emotions are discussed.\nKeywords: Emotions, health care, learning and memory, psychiatric disorders, regions of the brain, synaptic plasticity, treatment\nEmotions are general expressions that exhibit one\u2019s feelings. This involves fear, anger, happiness, eroticism, sadness, and tenderness. These all can be understood from the changes in the respiratory level, postural patterns, and facial expressions. Some feedback mechanisms in the brain are associated with changes in different emotions.[1] The influence of emotions in us and also in others refers to emotion regulation. This has become a popular subtopic in psychology, related to cognitive reappraisal, which is all about the thoughts of a person in a situation based on one\u2019s own emotions.[2,3] Emotions can also be evoked due to different art forms such as music, poetry, and dance.[4] One of the prevailing studies is the role of poetry in evoking an emotional response. There are different sorts of stimulation in studying the activity. The first sort of stimulation is understanding the natural language which can yield a mind-level model for stimulation. Prosody plays an important role in the second sort of stimulation of the emotional response. It helps in mimicking the emotional states of people and their characteristics. In the third sort of stimulation, we consider ourselves as a model and this helps to engage ourselves with the poetry and we start to cherish the emotion which leads to a condition named esthetic emotion.[5] Thus, emotions are involved in our daily activities, and they serve as a model for one\u2019s well-being.\nMany types of research are taking place to understand the areas of the brain that are responsible for emotional response, and in one such experiment with animal models, emotional learning and memory, the way emotions modulate memory, and the influence of emotion on attention and perception were studied. It is proven that the amygdala is involved in fear and other emotional activities.[6] The sensory input signals are received by the amygdala and these signals stop at the end of the lateral nucleus (LA). If there is any damage in the LA, it leads to fear conditions. There will be plasticity in the amygdala during the conditioning, and there might be some lesions that cause changes in cognitive functions.[7] There is a theory named the Need-Informational Theory of Emotions which signifies that there are different neural pathways for motivations, emotions, and intuition.[8] Some circuitries are involved in positive and negative emotional responses. The amygdala-neocortical circuitry explicitly shows the immediate consciousness of the implicit processing of emotions and the explicit processing of thoughts that are semantic based and are managed by the hippocampal-neocortical circuitry. The right hemisphere of the brain is responsible for regulating negative emotions. The left hemisphere is responsible for regulating positive emotions. The amygdala which is more involved in fear sensitization may lead to several phobias due to the increased sensitization-associated amygdala activity and these are proved through animal sensitization studies. This shows that there is a direct connection between emotions with learning and memory consolidation.[9]\nLearning is an activity of acquiring knowledge or information which is followed by storing the acquired information. Memory has been qualitatively differentiated in ways of storing information as declarative and nondeclarative. The categories of memories are formulated according to time, and they are of three classes, immediate memory which can last for seconds, short-term memory which can last for seconds to minutes, and long-term memory which can remain for about days to years.[10] These memories are stored in the form of synaptic connections. There will be a change in the connections of neurons, and the stability of synapses is established to be the mechanism through which the memory is encoded and stored as different types in the regions such as the hippocampus, cortex, amygdala, and cerebellum. This mechanism is defined as the induction of appropriate synapses during the formation of memory, and the storage of informa\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

While known for its wealth of cattle, in the \u201830s and \u201840s it also boasted another, less conventional claim to fame: None of its residents had cavities. The phenomenon was discovered by an Alabama-transplant dentist, Dr. G.W. Heard. In 1939, the 74-year-old Heard commented about the town\u2019s collective dental health to Austin-based dentist Dr. Edward Taylor, the Texas State Dental Health Officer \u2013 positing that the likely cause of the en masse dental health was a wealth of fluoride in the town\u2019s water supply, as well as the mineral-rich soil.\nTaylor commissioned a survey of the town\u2019s residents, finding that 43 of all natives surveyed, from a 2-year-old to pre-senior residents, had no cavities or fillings ever in their lifetime. What\u2019s more, Taylor found that cavities of non-native transplants had been lulled into a relative stasis \u2013 they didn\u2019t develop new cavities, and the previous cavities they\u2019d had weren\u2019t reactive anymore.\nTaylor published the results of his survey in the Journal of the American Dental Association in 1942, and his work inspired studies that were examined in a national profile on Hereford in Collier\u2019s, \u201cThe Town Without a Toothache,\u201d which rooted the connection between fluoridation and cavity-free teeth in the public consciousness. The article failed to mention, however, the town\u2019s water contained a high concentration of fluoride \u2013 three parts per million (ppm), compared to the CDC\u2019s recommendation of 0.7 ppm \u2013 that caused dental fluorosis, or \u201cTexas Teeth.\u201d Considering research that preceded Taylor\u2019s and the pro-fluoride studies that followed in his wake, in 1950, the American Dental Association officially endorsed fluoridation of water.\nThat same year, when many cities were considering fluoridating their water supplies in an effort to promote dental health \u2013 20 alone in Texas \u2013 another Taylor, Dr. Alfred Taylor, began a study testing a possible link between fluoride and cancer \u2013 initially to test a hypothesis that it was anti-carcinogenic.\nTaylor\u2019s study at UT\u2019s Clayton Biomedical Institute fed cancer-prone mice fluoridated water to test if they would grow tumors more quickly than mice that were fed distilled water. He and his team hadn\u2019t even finalized the study before its results were revealed to the general public. It seems somebody on his research team leaked the results.\nThose 20 cities in Texas halted their fluoridation efforts after Taylor\u2019s study was published. Taylor testified before a Congressional committee in 1952 and the AP\u2019s coverage, for some, cemented the connection between fluoride and cancer.\n\u201cThe rumor afforded the opponents, the diehards, and the lukewarms a screen to hide behind,\u201d said his counterpart Edward Taylor of the study.\nIt even prompted the attention of the Public Health Service, which came to Austin to attempt to replicate Alfred Taylor\u2019s experiment. They couldn\u2019t. As it turns out, Taylor had been feeding his mice fluoridated water and Purina food, which contained 60 times the amount of fluoride recommended by CDC guidelines.\nStill, Taylor completed another study that found harmful effects in 1965 that's still cited by anti-fluoride advocates.\nThe Austin City Council suggested in 1953 that the issue should be put to a vote \u201cwhenever that became an issue\u201d and the council continuously heard arguments for and against fluoridation at over a dozen meetings in the 1960s. In 1971, council put the item on the April ballot and it passed. Council again put on the ballot after pushback, and fluoridation appeared on the ballot in September of the following year. That proposal was binding, but, because it was initiated by council and not a citizen petition, it meant the council could decide upon the issue if it were taken up at the dais.\nYears later, the issue still rankles many Austinites and, because of that 1972 ballot initiative, the city\u2019s practice is still subject to council approval.\nThis story originally said it was the Health and Human Services Committee that discussed this issue, but it was also the Public Utilities Committee. It's been updated.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",
