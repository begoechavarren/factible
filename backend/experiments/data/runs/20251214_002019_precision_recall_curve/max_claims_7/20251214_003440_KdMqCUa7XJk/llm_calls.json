    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nThe week of Valentine's Day 2021, the temperature dropped below zero. Nobody could remember it being this cold for this long. This was Texas, not Siberia. But Texas is the energy state. There was nothing to fear. Just go home, turn on the heat, and hunker down. That's how it should have gone. Instead, over five days, four million Texans lost power during what turned out to be the coldest winter storm in a half a century. Hundreds died, including an 11-year-old boy who froze to death in his sleep. The state's electric grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, ERCOT, later reported the state was just four minutes away from total grid collapse. The media was quick to blame the state government for not being fully prepared and not acting fast enough. This may be true, but ERCOT's mistakes were symptoms, not the cause, of the problem. The real cause is decades of misguided policies that have left the Lone Star state with an unreliable energy infrastructure. It's a cautionary tale that the rest of the country needs to learn from. From 2010 to 2020, the population of Texas increased by 4 million people, and the state's economy grew by 35%. But while all this growth was happening, the state's reliable energy capacity was actually shrinking. Meanwhile, its unreliable energy capacity was surging. In fact, it almost tripled. Let's break this down. Reliable energy is fossil fuels\u2014coal and natural gas\u2014and nuclear. These fuels produce a near-constant flow of electricity. Unreliable, or variable energy, is renewable energy\u2014wind and solar. They're unreliable because they depend on the whims of Mother Nature. In 2020, Texans got 25% of their energy from renewables. During the February storm, however, that fell to 8%, at one point reaching a deadly low of just 1.5%. The reason? Renewable energy only works when the weather cooperates, but it's useless when it doesn't\u2014like when it conjures up a giant snowstorm. Solar panels don't capture sunlight and wind turbines don't spin when covered in snow and ice. Given renewables' unreliability, how is it that Texas, of all places, became so dependent on them? That story begins in 1999, when Texas politicians on the left and the right fell in love with the idea that they could turn the state into a green energy powerhouse. It sounded like a great idea at the time: Instead of passing any new mandates, they would do it by offering massive subsidies, marketed as \"incentives,\" to produce wind and solar power. This ended up working out great for the wind and solar companies, but not so great for reliable energy providers. To illustrate this, imagine that you own a restaurant. One day you learn that your competitor down the street is getting government support. He gets so much help that, instead of charging his customers, he can pay them to eat his food. Not surprisingly, your customers abandon your restaurant for his. Your competitor prospers off the taxpayers' backs while your business withers. Let's apply this analogy to the real world of renewable energy. Wind and solar get so much in subsidies they're guaranteed a profit. And unlike fossil fuel producers, they're not even required to provide reliable power. It's no wonder fossil fuel plants are closing, and nuclear plants are not being built. The wind and solar companies are protected from the laws of supply and demand. They can't lose, and the fossil fuel plants can't compete. That's how out of whack the Texas electricity market has become. Since 2006, the state has subsidized renewable energy to the tune of $19 billion. All of this came right out of Texans' wallets, courtesy of ever-increasing electric bills and rising property taxes. And what does Texas have to show for it? An electric grid that failed when Texans needed it most. Unfortunately, this scenario is playing out across America. Over the past decade, the federal government has spent over $230 billion on energy subsidies, and that doesn't even include subsidies the states give away. It's true that Uncle Sam also grants favors to fossil fuel companies. Renewable energy advocates love to point this out, but here's what they neglect to mention: compared to fossil fuel companies, for every unit of electricity generated, Washington subsidizes wind 17 times and solar 75 times more. Yet, despite all this aid, renewables provide just 4 percent of the country's total energy supply. The verdict is in: renewable energy is expensive and unreliable. And if it can render America's leading power producer powerless, it can do the same to your state. Government meddling got us into this mess. It's time for politicians to step aside and let the free market get us out of it. I'm Jason Isaac from the Texas Public Policy Foundation, for Prager University.",

(Texas Workforce Commission, September); Texas gained 168,000 jobs from ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nInflation, income growth, and population changes are key drivers of sales tax revenue growth. Adjusted for inflation, Texas\u2019 sales tax growth over the past two decades appears more modest. While nominal revenues grew at an average annual rate of 6.0%, real growth was only 3.5%. In other words, although the dollar value of sales tax revenues more than tripled, their actual purchasing power only doubled.\nFigure 2 \u2014 Texas Sales Tax Collections, 2003\u201324 ($000): Nominal vs. Inflation Adjusted\nTypically, changes in sales tax revenues and population are expected to be closely correlated. Between 2003 and 2024 in Texas, there was a positive correlation of approximately 2:1, meaning that sales tax revenue grew twice as fast as the population growth. Specifically, inflation-adjusted sales tax receipts during this period averaged a growth rate of 3.5%, outpacing the 1.6% population growth.\nMany factors impact this correlation: the growth in income, income concentration, changes in the consumption patterns of the population, and various demographic factors, such as age and the proportion of the population that is recent immigrants. Further research is warranted to establish comparable data on these factors, and the magnitude of their impacts on sales tax revenue.\nThe Texas Demographic Center issues population projections through 2060, the most recent release being projections for 2024. Like the U.S. Census, its projections include three immigration scenarios: high, mid, and low. The mid-case estimates predict that population growth in Texas will gradually slow over the next several decades, declining to 0.6% annually by the mid-2050s, with an average growth rate of 0.9% annually over the next 35 years. (Mid-case estimates typically refer to projections or forecasts that represent a moderate or central scenario among a range of possible outcomes, given a set of realistic assumptions and conditions.) If the state\u2019s population growth slows as projected, that will exert downward pressure on sales tax collections. For FY 2026 and FY 2027, the comptroller is estimating increases of 4.8% and 3.7%, respectively (BRE Table A-3).\nAfter federal transfer payments and sales taxes, the next largest revenue source for the state was categorized as state health service fees and rebates. As explained by the comptroller, this category includes \u201crevenue from the federally mandated and state supplemental Medicaid vendor drug programs,\u201d which \u201cconsists of rebates the state collects from drug manufacturers for drugs covered by state Medicaid programs.\u201d\nAlthough a detailed review of this category is beyond the scope of this brief, it is worth noting that the rebate has more than doubled since 2019, rising from $7 billion to $14 billion. More importantly, the comptroller projects a 17% decline this year (BRE Table A-16), followed by a continued but more gradual decrease over the remainder of the biennium.\nThe energy sector, especially oil and natural gas production, remains the backbone of the Texas economy. Texas imposes a 4.6% tax on the value of oil and a 7.5% tax on the value of natural gas produced in the state. Combined, these two taxes generated $8.5 billion in revenue for the state in 2024, just under 5% of total revenue.\nThese production taxes, often referred to as severance taxes, have historically fluctuated significantly depending on the volume of oil and natural gas extracted and their respective market prices. Since the widespread adoption of fracking technology and the resulting increases in production, Texas\u2019 oil production tax has increased sixfold since 2010.\nNatural gas production in the U.S. has also increased steadily over the last two decades, driven by advances in hydraulic fracturing. In more recent years, though, its growth has been less dramatic than that of oil, due to market gluts, lower prices, and infrastructure constraints. As a result, Texas\u2019 natural gas production has shown more volatility and less growth.\nFigure 3 \u2014 Oil and Natural Gas Production Tax Collections ($000)\nThe future of the fossil fuel industry remains uncertain. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration\u2019s reference case, oil production is expected to peak in 2027 at around 14 million barrels per day, then gradually decline to 11 million barrels by 2050. Under this scenario, state production tax revenues would likely remain relatively stable over the next 25 years, though without the dramatic growth seen over the past two decades.\nHistorical data and recent projections from the comptroller suggest that the period of consistent budget surpluses may be drawing to a close. This shift will likely require future legislatures to take a more deliberate approach to budgeting and revenue allocation. Nonetheless, Texas remains better positioned than many other states, owing to its relatively stable and diversified revenue base.\nUnless otherwise indicated, statistics are based on authors\u2019 analysis of publicly available revenue estimate data.\nUpdated on Nov. 14, 2023, at 12:10 pm CST.\nThis publication was produced on behalf of Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy.

What might have been a rare opportunity for residents to experience significant snow accumulation turned catastrophic as power blackouts spanned most of the state from Feb. 15-18. A survey conducted by the University of Houston (UH) Hobby School of Public Affairs in mid-March found that more than two out of three, or 69 percent, of Texans lost power at some point during Feb. 14-20, and almost half, or about 49 percent, had disruptions in water service. The storm contributed to at least 210 deaths, and sources cited by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas estimated the state\u2019s storm-related financial losses would range from $80 billion to $130 billion.\nLike many other things in Texas, energy is big, and much of it also is independent. That independence extends to Texas\u2019 unique place as the only state in the continental United States that is not substantially interconnected with either the Eastern Interconnection or the Western Interconnection (Exhibit 1). The Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC) regulates the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which manages the electricity grid.\nSource: ERCOT\nMore than 26 million Texas customers, or nearly 90 percent of the state\u2019s population, depend on ERCOT for electricity services. ERCOT does not have its own grid infrastructure but instead relies on power generation companies, electricity providers/utilities (i.e., investor-owned and municipally owned providers, electric cooperatives and the river authorities), and transmission and distribution utilities that participate in the wholesale energy market.\nTexas energy is generated from a variety of sources (PDF) with the majority supplied by natural gas, wind and coal \u2014 51 percent, 24.8 percent and 13.4 percent, respectively (Exhibit 2). More than 1,800 active market participants generate, move, buy, sell or use wholesale electricity, and ERCOT works with them to provide individual consumers with electricity. To ensure that the process runs smoothly, ERCOT produces seasonal planning reports to prepare for changes in weather and demand, as well as for potential emergencies based on historical data and planned outages for maintenance as well as other similar purposes.\nSource: ERCOT\nWinter Storm Uri far exceeded the parameters of ERCOT\u2019s seasonal planning. According to the National Weather Service, freezing rain and drizzle coated North and Central Texas as the storm began rolling in on Feb. 11, 2021, causing up to one-half inch of ice accumulation in some locations. Snow later followed on Feb. 14-17, with 5 inches recorded at Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) International Airport and 4.6 inches recorded at Waco Regional Airport. DFW recorded 139 consecutive hours of at or below freezing temperatures, and the Waco airport recorded 205 consecutive hours.\nGov. Greg Abbott issued a state of emergency declaration (PDF) on Feb. 12 due to the severity of the storm. On Feb. 13, some electricity generators began experiencing outages, and on Feb. 14, ERCOT issued a public plea for customers to reduce energy usage after power generation could not be increased to meet demand. As the grid continued to struggle to meet demand, controlled blackouts occurred, and on Feb. 15, ERCOT issued a declaration of emergency. According to a University of Texas at Austin (UT-Austin) Energy Report (PDF), the grid did not normalize until Feb. 19 and narrowly missed a catastrophic failure that potentially could have caused a total blackout throughout the state.\nThe UT-Austin report found that Uri, although not the most severe Texas winter storm on record, caused the most loss of electricity. The report also stated that rolling blackouts were intended to take stress off the power grid but turned into outages that \u2014 in some parts of the state \u2014 lasted several days. According to the report, multiple factors caused those extended blackouts, including that ERCOT underestimated peak demand by nearly 14 percent and weather forecasts misjudged the severity and timing of the storm.\nWhile planned generator outages fell within the appropriate range listed in ERCOT\u2019s seasonal plan, the report found that outages were still high in number. Additionally, energy power generators failed on all fronts, including those powered by natural gas, wind and coal.\nSource: University of Houston, Hobby School of Public Affairs, \u201cThe Winter Storm of 2021\u201d survey\nAs mentioned, 210 people perished because of Winter Storm Uri. According to the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS), most fatalities can be attributed to hypothermia, vehicle crashes, carbon monoxide poisoning and chronic medical conditions complicated by the storm. (DSHS continues to monitor and update this figure as new information becomes available.)\nMany residents found conditions within their homes unbearable, with indoor temperatures at or below freezing. Texas residents who were dependent on electrically powered medical equipment were especially vulnerable. According to the UH survey, of the 69 percent of Texans who lost power during the storm, their average disruption was 42 hours \u2014 31 of those consecutive. And of the 49 percent of Texans who lost running water, their average disruption was 52 hours (Exhibit 3).\nIn addition to electricity and other utility disruptions, Texas residents experienced a host of negative effects from the winter storm (Exhibit 4). The UH survey found that three-quarters of respondents had difficulty procuring food and groceries. Meanwhile, 31 percent had water damage to their residences, and of those, only 18 percent believed insurance would likely cover the damage.\nSource: University of Houston, Hobby School of Public Affairs, \u201cThe Winter Storm of 2021\u201d survey\nA recent study by the Texas Real Estate Center at Texas A&M University reported that, in 2019, 11 percent of homeowners in metropolitan areas had n\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

What might have been a rare opportunity for residents to experience significant snow accumulation turned catastrophic as power blackouts spanned most of the state from Feb. 15-18. A survey conducted by the University of Houston (UH) Hobby School of Public Affairs in mid-March found that more than two out of three, or 69 percent, of Texans lost power at some point during Feb. 14-20, and almost half, or about 49 percent, had disruptions in water service. The storm contributed to at least 210 deaths, and sources cited by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas estimated the state\u2019s storm-related financial losses would range from $80 billion to $130 billion.\nLike many other things in Texas, energy is big, and much of it also is independent. That independence extends to Texas\u2019 unique place as the only state in the continental United States that is not substantially interconnected with either the Eastern Interconnection or the Western Interconnection (Exhibit 1). The Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC) regulates the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which manages the electricity grid.\nSource: ERCOT\nMore than 26 million Texas customers, or nearly 90 percent of the state\u2019s population, depend on ERCOT for electricity services. ERCOT does not have its own grid infrastructure but instead relies on power generation companies, electricity providers/utilities (i.e., investor-owned and municipally owned providers, electric cooperatives and the river authorities), and transmission and distribution utilities that participate in the wholesale energy market.\nTexas energy is generated from a variety of sources (PDF) with the majority supplied by natural gas, wind and coal \u2014 51 percent, 24.8 percent and 13.4 percent, respectively (Exhibit 2). More than 1,800 active market participants generate, move, buy, sell or use wholesale electricity, and ERCOT works with them to provide individual consumers with electricity. To ensure that the process runs smoothly, ERCOT produces seasonal planning reports to prepare for changes in weather and demand, as well as for potential emergencies based on historical data and planned outages for maintenance as well as other similar purposes.\nSource: ERCOT\nWinter Storm Uri far exceeded the parameters of ERCOT\u2019s seasonal planning.

Adjusted for inflation, Texas\u2019 sales tax growth over the past two decades appears more modest. While nominal revenues grew at an average annual rate of 6.0%, real growth was only 3.5%. In other words, although the dollar value of sales tax revenues more than tripled, their actual purchasing power only doubled.\nFigure 2 \u2014 Texas Sales Tax Collections, 2003\u201324 ($000): Nominal vs. Inflation Adjusted\nTypically, changes in sales tax revenues and population are expected to be closely correlated. Between 2003 and 2024 in Texas, there was a positive correlation of approximately 2:1, meaning that sales tax revenue grew twice as fast as the population growth. Specifically, inflation-adjusted sales tax receipts during this period averaged a growth rate of 3.5%, outpacing the 1.6% population growth.\nMany factors impact this correlation: the growth in income, income concentration, changes in the consumption patterns of the population, and various demographic factors, such as age and the proportion of the population that is recent immigrants. Further research is warranted to establish comparable data on these factors, and the magnitude of their impacts on sales tax revenue.\nThe Texas Demographic Center issues population projections through 2060, the most recent release being projections for 2024. Like the U.S. Census, its projections include three immigration scenarios: high, mid, and low. The mid-case estimates predict that population growth in Texas will gradually slow over the next several decades, declining to 0.6% annually by the mid-2050s, with an average growth rate of 0.9% annually over the next 35 years. (Mid-case estimates typically refer to projections or forecasts that represent a moderate or central scenario among a range of possible outcomes, given a set of realistic assumptions and conditions.) If the state\u2019s population growth slows as projected, that will exert downward pressure on sales tax collections. For FY 2026 and FY 2027, the comptroller is estimating increases of 4.8% and 3.7%, respectively (BRE Table A-3).\nAfter federal transfer payments and sales taxes, the next largest revenue source for the state was categorized as state health service fees and rebates. As explained by the comptroller, this category includes \u201crevenue from the federally mandated and state supplemental Medicaid vendor drug programs,\u201d which \u201cconsists of rebates the state collects from drug manufacturers for drugs covered by state Medicaid programs.\u201d\nAlthough a detailed review of this category is beyond the scope of this brief, it is worth noting that the rebate has more than doubled since 2019, rising from $7 billion to $14 billion. More importantly, the comptroller projects a 17% decline this year (BRE Table A-16), followed by a continued but more gradual decrease over the remainder of the biennium.\nThe energy sector, especially oil and natural gas production, remains the backbone of the Texas economy. Texas imposes a 4.6% tax on the value of oil and a 7.5% tax on the value of natural gas produced in the state. Combined, these two taxes generated $8.5 billion in revenue for the state in 2024, just under 5% of total revenue.\nThese production taxes, often referred to as severance taxes, have historically fluctuated significantly depending on the volume of oil and natural gas extracted and their respective market prices. Since the widespread adoption of fracking technology and the resulting increases in production, Texas\u2019 oil production tax has increased sixfold since 2010.\nNatural gas production in the U.S. has also increased steadily over the last two decades, driven by advances in hydraulic fracturing. In more recent years, though, its growth has been less dramatic than that of oil, due to market gluts, lower prices, and infrastructure constraints. As a result, Texas\u2019 natural gas production has shown more volatility and less growth.\nFigure 3 \u2014 Oil and Natural Gas Production Tax Collections ($000)\nThe future of the fossil fuel industry remains uncertain. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration\u2019s reference case, oil production is expected to peak in 2027 at around 14 million barrels per day, then gradually decline to 11 million barrels by 2050. Under this scenario, state production tax revenues would likely remain relatively stable over the next 25 years, though without the dramatic growth seen over the past two decades.\nHistorical data and recent projections from the comptroller suggest that the period of consistent budget surpluses may be drawing to a close. This shift will likely require future legislatures to take a more deliberate approach to budgeting and revenue allocation. Nonetheless, Texas remains better positioned than many other states, owing to its relatively stable and diversified revenue base.\nUnless otherwise indicated, statistics are based on authors\u2019 analysis of publicly available revenue estimate data.\nUpdated on Nov. 14, 2023, at 12:10 pm CST.\nThis publication was produced on behalf of Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy.

A powerful winter storm affected much of the country from February 13-17, 2021. This resulted in over 170 million Americans being placed under various National Weather Service-issued winter weather warnings and advisories. The storm caused power outages for more than 9.9 million people in the U.S. and Mexico. On February 14, the entire state of Texas was under a Winter Storm Warning.\nBy February 21, the death toll from the winter storm had climbed to at least 82, including 70 people in the United States and 12 people in Mexico. It is the deadliest winter storm in North America since the ice storm in January 2007, which killed 87 people. Just a few days later, another strong winter storm swept across the country. This brought more record-breaking wintry precipitation and cold weather.\nMany records were broken during mid-February 2021, especially in Texas. The average temperature across Texas on February 15 was 11.8 F, which is unusually low. Numerous areas in Texas saw temperatures that were 35-40 degrees below normal. Keep in mind that many Texas residents had no power during this record cold snap, making for a very dangerous situation. Areas further north such as in Minnesota and Nebraska broke their daily low temperature records, with temperatures reaching between -30 and -40 F.\nAcross the United States from February 7-20, there were 9,027 daily cold temperature records that were either tied or broken, says preliminary data from NOAA. These include both daily cold high and low (lowest high and lowest low) temperatures from locations that have at least a 30-year history of weather data. In addition, some of the records set were not only for a single day or month, but the lowest temperature ever recorded at that location.\nThere were also many snowfall records that were shattered this February. On February 16, 73% of the continental U.S. was covered in snow. This is a new record dating back to the fall of 2003 when those measurements began. Many areas that generally see little to no snow during the winter received snow in mid-February. Some of those towns broke their all-time snowfall record. Perhaps most notably, Del Rio, Texas, which is very close to the Mexican border, received 11.2 inches of snow on February 18. This was its snowiest day ever. Del Rio had not seen an inch of snow in one day since 1993.\nWhile the mid-February storms that affected Texas, the Great Plains and other parts of the South made the biggest headlines, that wasn\u2019t all that this past February brought. A snowstorm that began on January 31 and continued through February 2 set snowfall records in parts of the Northeast. Mount Arlington, New Jersey saw 35.1 inches of snowfall across the 3 days. This would be a state record for a 3-day snowfall. However, the snowfall amount is still being confirmed. Many areas saw over 2 feet of snow from that storm. With temperatures remaining cold and additional smaller snowfalls occurring, much of the Northeast saw snow cover on the ground throughout the entire month of February. The\nPacific Northwest wasn\u2019t left out of the fun, as Seattle and Portland had their biggest two-day snowfalls in about 50 years.\nFebruary 2021 was definitely a month of extremes that affected almost everyone in the United States in some way, whether it be via snowfall, cold temperatures, or even tornadoes, as there were a couple of those. March was a quieter month, but there\u2019s always more weather events just around the corner, and more records to set.\nGive CompuWeather a call at 1 (800) 825-4445.

It is possible that the collections immediately following the decision may include a one-time increase in the level of sales taxes collected.\nInflation, income growth, and population changes are key drivers of sales tax revenue growth. Adjusted for inflation, Texas\u2019 sales tax growth over the past two decades appears more modest. While nominal revenues grew at an average annual rate of 6.0%, real growth was only 3.5%. In other words, although the dollar value of sales tax revenues more than tripled, their actual purchasing power only doubled.\nFigure 2 \u2014 Texas Sales Tax Collections, 2003\u201324 ($000): Nominal vs. Inflation Adjusted\nTypically, changes in sales tax revenues and population are expected to be closely correlated. Between 2003 and 2024 in Texas, there was a positive correlation of approximately 2:1, meaning that sales tax revenue grew twice as fast as the population growth. Specifically, inflation-adjusted sales tax receipts during this period averaged a growth rate of 3.5%, outpacing the 1.6% population growth.\nMany factors impact this correlation: the growth in income, income concentration, changes in the consumption patterns of the population, and various demographic factors, such as age and the proportion of the population that is recent immigrants. Further research is warranted to establish comparable data on these factors, and the magnitude of their impacts on sales tax revenue.\nThe Texas Demographic Center issues population projections through 2060, the most recent release being projections for 2024. Like the U.S. Census, its projections include three immigration scenarios: high, mid, and low. The mid-case estimates predict that population growth in Texas will gradually slow over the next several decades, declining to 0.6% annually by the mid-2050s, with an average growth rate of 0.9% annually over the next 35 years. (Mid-case estimates typically refer to projections or forecasts that represent a moderate or central scenario among a range of possible outcomes, given a set of realistic assumptions and conditions.) If the state\u2019s population growth slows as projected, that will exert downward pressure on sales tax collections. For FY 2026 and FY 2027, the comptroller is estimating increases of 4.8% and 3.7%, respectively (BRE Table A-3).\nAfter federal transfer payments and sales taxes, the next largest revenue source for the state was categorized as state health service fees and rebates. As explained by the comptroller, this category includes \u201crevenue from the federally mandated and state supplemental Medicaid vendor drug programs,\u201d which \u201cconsists of rebates the state collects from drug manufacturers for drugs covered by state Medicaid programs.\u201d\nAlthough a detailed review of this category is beyond the scope of this brief, it is worth noting that the rebate has more than doubled since 2019, rising from $7 billion to $14 billion. More importantly, the comptroller projects a 17% decline this year (BRE Table A-16), followed by a continued but more gradual decrease over the remainder of the biennium.\nThe energy sector, especially oil and natural gas production, remains the backbone of the Texas economy. Texas imposes a 4.6% tax on the value of oil and a 7.5% tax on the value of natural gas produced in the state. Combined, these two taxes generated $8.5 billion in revenue for the state in 2024, just under 5% of total revenue.\nThese production taxes, often referred to as severance taxes, have historically fluctuated significantly depending on the volume of oil and natural gas extracted and their respective market prices. Since the widespread adoption of fracking technology and the resulting increases in production, Texas\u2019 oil production tax has increased sixfold since 2010.\nNatural gas production in the U.S. has also increased steadily over the last two decades, driven by advances in hydraulic fracturing. In more recent years, though, its growth has been less dramatic than that of oil, due to market gluts, lower prices, and infrastructure constraints. As a result, Texas\u2019 natural gas production has shown more volatility and less growth.\nFigure 3 \u2014 Oil and Natural Gas Production Tax Collections ($000)\nThe future of the fossil fuel industry remains uncertain. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration\u2019s reference case, oil production is expected to peak in 2027 at around 14 million barrels per day, then gradually decline to 11 million barrels by 2050. Under this scenario, state production tax revenues would likely remain relatively stable over the next 25 years, though without the dramatic growth seen over the past two decades.\nHistorical data and recent projections from the comptroller suggest that the period of consistent budget surpluses may be drawing to a close. This shift will likely require future legislatures to take a more deliberate approach to budgeting and revenue allocation. Nonetheless, Texas remains better positioned than many other states, owing to its relatively stable and diversified revenue base.\nUnless otherwise indicated, statistics are based on authors\u2019 analysis of publicly available revenue estimate data.\nUpdated on Nov. 14, 2023, at 12:10 pm CST.\nThis publication was produced on behalf of Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy.

Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar recognized the importance of building on the strength of the state\u2019s infrastructure in his Good for Texas Tour: Energy Edition which highlighted key energy components that keep the state economy running.\nAlthough there\u2019s work to do, there\u2019s a lot to build on. Texas is the largest oil and natural gas producer in the United States, accounting for 42 percent and 27 percent of the nation\u2019s total, respectively. Texas has 32 petroleum refineries, more than any other state, capable of processing more than 5.9 million barrels of crude oil per day, or 32 percent of U.S. refining capacity. Texas alone produces more than 12 percent of the nation\u2019s total electricity. Additionally, Texas has nearly 25 percent of U.S. dry natural gas reserves, meaning natural gas that has a high concentration of methane and no liquefiable hydrocarbon. In 2021, Texas liquefied natural gas terminals accounted for 50 percent of U.S. natural gas exports.\nNot only is Texas a national leader in energy production, but it also leads in energy consumption. In 2021, Texas consumed more than 14 trillion Btu (British thermal units, a measurement of heat content as energy), nearly twice that of the second-leading consumer of energy, California (Exhibit 1). Texas\u2019 industrial sector, including chemical manufacturing, natural gas extraction and petroleum refining, is the largest energy user, consuming more than half of the state\u2019s energy. As Texas\u2019 energy demand is higher than ever, the need to update the state\u2019s electricity infrastructure is of utmost importance. The availability of both fossil fuels and renewable energy is crucial for maintaining the dependability of the state\u2019s electrical grid.\nSource: U.S. Energy Information Administration\nDuring his latest Good for Texas Tour series, Hegar visited energy sites across Texas to explore their innovative efforts to bolster the state\u2019s diverse energy portfolio and meet the demands of a rapidly growing population and industry base.\nBoth fossil fuels and renewable energy sources play an important role in Texas\u2019 energy profile, which includes natural gas, coal, nuclear, wind, solar and biomass (Exhibit 2). Wind is the most-used renewable energy source in Texas; the state also ranks first nationally in wind energy production, accounting for 26 percent of the U.S. total, but it is intermittent by nature and thus cannot be relied upon as a sole source of power.\nFossil fuels such as natural gas provide the greatest portion of reliable, dispatchable energy and are particularly crucial when renewable energy is not available. (Dispatchable energy is composed of sources of electricity that can be programmed or adjusted on demand based on market needs.) Natural gas is abundant and is the state\u2019s largest single source of power, providing 41.8 percent of Texas\u2019 electric-generating capacity in 2023, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). Texas leads the country in natural gas production, accounting for more than one-fourth of the nation\u2019s natural gas production in 2022, and it supports the global economy with its natural gas exports.\nSource: U.S. Energy Information Administration\nIn November 2023, Texas voters approved Proposition 7, a constitutional amendment to establish the Texas Energy Fund to support the reliability of the state\u2019s electric grid, with a focus on natural gas. The Texas Legislature appropriated $5 billion to the new fund contingent on voter approval of the amendment. Senate Bill 2627, enabling legislation for the amendment, allows the Public Utility Commission (PUC) to award grants and loans to support Texas\u2019 dispatchable energy fleet through construction of new natural gas power plants and improvements to existing natural gas power plants.\nThe effort of this amendment is twofold: to increase generation of dispatchable electricity to improve grid reliability and help reverse the trend of an aging dispatchable energy infrastructure. About 41 percent of Texas\u2019 thermal power generation \u2015 a category including natural gas, nuclear and coal \u2015 comes from facilities that are more than three decades old according to information collected by ERCOT.\nIn addition to state-funded efforts to increase grid reliability, federal incentives such as Residential Clean Energy Credits have kicked off greater interest in battery storage capacity, which is particularly important to renewable energy. Battery storage is also receiving increased support from private projects, like the completion of battery developer Plus Power\u2019s $1.8 billion financing package to incorporate renewables and stabilize the power grid including supporting the construction of 700 megawatts (MW) of batteries on ERCOT\u2019s grid. Improvements in technology and further development of battery storage in Texas will play an increasing part in grid reliability as our state\u2019s population continues to grow.\nTexas has been affected by a nationwide shortage of electrical distribution transformers, used to convert transmission line voltage into usable electricity for homes and businesses, typically through utility poles or underground power lines. This shortage is caused by the U.S.\u2019 lack of ability to produce needed amounts of grain-oriented electrical steel, which is needed to make transformers, leading the country to seek transformers from other countries instead. The lack of transformer availability has caused electric grid expansions and construction to pause, or in some cases, cancel. Wait times and costs to receive transformers continue to increase drastically. For example, in 2023, only six out of 149 transformers were supplied for an order placed in June 2022 by New Braunfels Utilities, the power provider for th\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Statewide supply ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nFebruary 2021 was one for the record books in terms of cold, wintry weather across the United States. A powerful winter storm affected much of the country from February 13-17, 2021. This resulted in over 170 million Americans being placed under various National Weather Service-issued winter weather warnings and advisories. The storm caused power outages for more than 9.9 million people in the U.S. and Mexico. On February 14, the entire state of Texas was under a Winter Storm Warning.\nBy February 21, the death toll from the winter storm had climbed to at least 82, including 70 people in the United States and 12 people in Mexico. It is the deadliest winter storm in North America since the ice storm in January 2007, which killed 87 people. Just a few days later, another strong winter storm swept across the country. This brought more record-breaking wintry precipitation and cold weather.\nMany records were broken during mid-February 2021, especially in Texas. The average temperature across Texas on February 15 was 11.8 F, which is unusually low. Numerous areas in Texas saw temperatures that were 35-40 degrees below normal. Keep in mind that many Texas residents had no power during this record cold snap, making for a very dangerous situation. Areas further north such as in Minnesota and Nebraska broke their daily low temperature records, with temperatures reaching between -30 and -40 F.\nAcross the United States from February 7-20, there were 9,027 daily cold temperature records that were either tied or broken, says preliminary data from NOAA. These include both daily cold high and low (lowest high and lowest low) temperatures from locations that have at least a 30-year history of weather data. In addition, some of the records set were not only for a single day or month, but the lowest temperature ever recorded at that location.\nThere were also many snowfall records that were shattered this February. On February 16, 73% of the continental U.S. was covered in snow. This is a new record dating back to the fall of 2003 when those measurements began. Many areas that generally see little to no snow during the winter received snow in mid-February. Some of those towns broke their all-time snowfall record. Perhaps most notably, Del Rio, Texas, which is very close to the Mexican border, received 11.2 inches of snow on February 18. This was its snowiest day ever. Del Rio had not seen an inch of snow in one day since 1993.\nWhile the mid-February storms that affected Texas, the Great Plains and other parts of the South made the biggest headlines, that wasn\u2019t all that this past February brought. A snowstorm that began on January 31 and continued through February 2 set snowfall records in parts of the Northeast. Mount Arlington, New Jersey saw 35.1 inches of snowfall across the 3 days. This would be a state record for a 3-day snowfall. However, the snowfall amount is still being confirmed. Many areas saw over 2 feet of snow from that storm. With temperatures remaining cold and additional smaller snowfalls occurring, much of the Northeast saw snow cover on the ground throughout the entire month of February. The\nPacific Northwest wasn\u2019t left out of the fun, as Seattle and Portland had their biggest two-day snowfalls in about 50 years.\nFebruary 2021 was definitely a month of extremes that affected almost everyone in the United States in some way, whether it be via snowfall, cold temperatures, or even tornadoes, as there were a couple of those. March was a quieter month, but there\u2019s always more weather events just around the corner, and more records to set.\nGive CompuWeather a call at 1 (800) 825-4445.

Could you explain what led to these widespread power outages?\nWhat\u2019s happening now is that demand is at record highs as we\u2019re trying to keep our homes warm in the coldest freeze that we\u2019ve had in three decades. Demand for power right now is around 70 gigawatts and power plants in Texas right now can only supply about 45 gigawatts.\nAnd so the system simply isn\u2019t able to handle demand at the level it is, mostly because so many power plants are down right now. People are trying to keep their homes warm. Yet power plants aren\u2019t able to operate the way they normally do both because they weren\u2019t designed to operate well in freezing cold conditions and freezing rain conditions, and because many of the natural gas power plants aren\u2019t able to get enough gas to burn.\nBeyond the current conditions that are limiting operations and driving up demand, is there anything unique about Texas' energy infrastructure that has led us to this moment?\nWhat makes it challenging to handle this is that we don\u2019t have options that might give us more flexibility. We can\u2019t import power from other states because we have so few lines connecting the Texas grid to our neighboring states. When it comes to electricity, what happens in Texas stays in Texas. Because Texas made a decision many decades ago to have its own power grid that wouldn\u2019t connect to the rest of the country, in part because we didn\u2019t want federal rules telling us the way Texas would handle things. And we\u2019re paying the price for that now. Because just when we need the power most, we\u2019re not able to import any of it from our neighboring states.\nFROM THE TEXAS TRIBUNE | Why Does Texas Have Its Own Power Grid?\nTexas relies heavily on natural gas. But what about the other energy sources?\nIn general, the state gets around half of its power from natural gas, and around 20% from wind, around 20% from coal and most of the rest from nuclear. And usually it leads to pretty reliable power because usually wind and solar are able to generate as much as they can, and natural gas adjusts to be able to meet the ups and downs of wind and solar and of when we need power the most.\nWhat\u2019s happening now is what has traditionally been thought of as a viable source of power \u2014 natural gas \u2014 has been struggling. There\u2019s record demand for natural gas, not just from power plants, but also from burning natural gas directly in our homes and offices.\nLooking beyond right here, right now and keeping the bigger picture in mind, what can Texas do to prevent blackouts like this during cold weather weather events in the future?\nThere is no one silver bullet to keep this from happening again, we\u2019re going to need a menu of options. We\u2019re going to need to better insulate (and) weatherize our homes so that we can bring down the demand. We need to think about building some transmission lines to connect our isolated island with other states to be able to trade power. We need to have more storage on the grid \u2014 at the moment, there\u2019s only a very tiny, tiny amount of power that can be stored in batteries.\nAnd we need to be sure we\u2019re maintaining a diversified supply, especially during daytime \u2014 now, solar panels are working great, but we don\u2019t have many of them in the state. Having wind turbines in different parts of the state means that if we have icing conditions in some areas, then wind turbines can be operating well in others. So I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s an all-of-the-above approach, but it\u2019s not going to be a single approach.\nWhat do you think Texas can learn from the historic winter conditions and widespread power outages happening today?\nIf you had asked me a year ago whether to plan for an event like this, I would have thought this was very unlikely. Overall with climate change, warming is happening more strongly in the wintertime. In the 1970s, freezing events \u2014 nights that got below 32 \u00b0F \u2014 happened five times as often as they do today.\nSo most of the time when we\u2019re thinking about resiliency planning, we\u2019re thinking about preparing for the hottest summer afternoons, which are getting hotter than they ever were before.\nSo I think this event is going to tell us that even though we have this warming happening, we still do need to be prepared for winter freeze events and perhaps stronger winter freeze events than we thought seemed possible.\nHave a News Tip?

On February 14, the entire state of Texas was under a Winter Storm Warning.\nBy February 21, the death toll from the winter storm had climbed to at least 82, including 70 people in the United States and 12 people in Mexico. It is the deadliest winter storm in North America since the ice storm in January 2007, which killed 87 people. Just a few days later, another strong winter storm swept across the country. This brought more record-breaking wintry precipitation and cold weather.\nMany records were broken during mid-February 2021, especially in Texas. The average temperature across Texas on February 15 was 11.8 F, which is unusually low. Numerous areas in Texas saw temperatures that were 35-40 degrees below normal. Keep in mind that many Texas residents had no power during this record cold snap, making for a very dangerous situation. Areas further north such as in Minnesota and Nebraska broke their daily low temperature records, with temperatures reaching between -30 and -40 F.\nAcross the United States from February 7-20, there were 9,027 daily cold temperature records that were either tied or broken, says preliminary data from NOAA. These include both daily cold high and low (lowest high and lowest low) temperatures from locations that have at least a 30-year history of weather data. In addition, some of the records set were not only for a single day or month, but the lowest temperature ever recorded at that location.\nThere were also many snowfall records that were shattered this February. On February 16, 73% of the continental U.S. was covered in snow. This is a new record dating back to the fall of 2003 when those measurements began. Many areas that generally see little to no snow during the winter received snow in mid-February. Some of those towns broke their all-time snowfall record. Perhaps most notably, Del Rio, Texas, which is very close to the Mexican border, received 11.2 inches of snow on February 18. This was its snowiest day ever. Del Rio had not seen an inch of snow in one day since 1993.\nWhile the mid-February storms that affected Texas, the Great Plains and other parts of the South made the biggest headlines, that wasn\u2019t all that this past February brought. A snowstorm that began on January 31 and continued through February 2 set snowfall records in parts of the Northeast. Mount Arlington, New Jersey saw 35.1 inches of snowfall across the 3 days. This would be a state record for a 3-day snowfall. However, the snowfall amount is still being confirmed. Many areas saw over 2 feet of snow from that storm. With temperatures remaining cold and additional smaller snowfalls occurring, much of the Northeast saw snow cover on the ground throughout the entire month of February. The\nPacific Northwest wasn\u2019t left out of the fun, as Seattle and Portland had their biggest two-day snowfalls in about 50 years.\nFebruary 2021 was definitely a month of extremes that affected almost everyone in the United States in some way, whether it be via snowfall, cold temperatures, or even tornadoes, as there were a couple of those. March was a quieter month, but there\u2019s always more weather events just around the corner, and more records to set.\nGive CompuWeather a call at 1 (800) 825-4445.

Could you explain what led to these widespread power outages?\nWhat\u2019s happening now is that demand is at record highs as we\u2019re trying to keep our homes warm in the coldest freeze that we\u2019ve had in three decades. Demand for power right now is around 70 gigawatts and power plants in Texas right now can only supply about 45 gigawatts.\nAnd so the system simply isn\u2019t able to handle demand at the level it is, mostly because so many power plants are down right now. People are trying to keep their homes warm. Yet power plants aren\u2019t able to operate the way they normally do both because they weren\u2019t designed to operate well in freezing cold conditions and freezing rain conditions, and because many of the natural gas power plants aren\u2019t able to get enough gas to burn.\nBeyond the current conditions that are limiting operations and driving up demand, is there anything unique about Texas' energy infrastructure that has led us to this moment?\nWhat makes it challenging to handle this is that we don\u2019t have options that might give us more flexibility. We can\u2019t import power from other states because we have so few lines connecting the Texas grid to our neighboring states. When it comes to electricity, what happens in Texas stays in Texas. Because Texas made a decision many decades ago to have its own power grid that wouldn\u2019t connect to the rest of the country, in part because we didn\u2019t want federal rules telling us the way Texas would handle things. And we\u2019re paying the price for that now. Because just when we need the power most, we\u2019re not able to import any of it from our neighboring states.\nFROM THE TEXAS TRIBUNE | Why Does Texas Have Its Own Power Grid?\nTexas relies heavily on natural gas. But what about the other energy sources?\nIn general, the state gets around half of its power from natural gas, and around 20% from wind, around 20% from coal and most of the rest from nuclear. And usually it leads to pretty reliable power because usually wind and solar are able to generate as much as they can, and natural gas adjusts to be able to meet the ups and downs of wind and solar and of when we need power the most.\nWhat\u2019s happening now is what has traditionally been thought of as a viable source of power \u2014 natural gas \u2014 has been struggling. There\u2019s record demand for natural gas, not just from power plants, but also from burning natural gas directly in our homes and offices.\nLooking beyond right here, right now and keeping the bigger picture in mind, what can Texas do to prevent blackouts like this during cold weather weather events in the future?\nThere is no one silver bullet to keep this from happening again, we\u2019re going to need a menu of options. We\u2019re going to need to better insulate (and) weatherize our homes so that we can bring down the demand. We need to think about building some transmission lines to connect our isolated island with other states to be able to trade power. We need to have more storage on the grid \u2014 at the moment, there\u2019s only a very tiny, tiny amount of power that can be stored in batteries.\nAnd we need to be sure we\u2019re maintaining a diversified supply, especially during daytime \u2014 now, solar panels are working great, but we don\u2019t have many of them in the state. Having wind turbines in different parts of the state means that if we have icing conditions in some areas, then wind turbines can be operating well in others. So I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s an all-of-the-above approach, but it\u2019s not going to be a single approach.\nWhat do you think Texas can learn from the historic winter conditions and widespread power outages happening today?\nIf you had asked me a year ago whether to plan for an event like this, I would have thought this was very unlikely. Overall with climate change, warming is happening more strongly in the wintertime. In the 1970s, freezing events \u2014 nights that got below 32 \u00b0F \u2014 happened five times as often as they do today.\nSo most of the time when we\u2019re thinking about resiliency planning, we\u2019re thinking about preparing for the hottest summer afternoons, which are getting hotter than they ever were before.\nSo I think this event is going to tell us that even though we have this warming happening, we still do need to be prepared for winter freeze events and perhaps stronger winter freeze events than we thought seemed possible.\nHave a News Tip?

Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar recognized the importance of building on the strength of the state\u2019s infrastructure in his Good for Texas Tour: Energy Edition which highlighted key energy components that keep the state economy running.\nAlthough there\u2019s work to do, there\u2019s a lot to build on. Texas is the largest oil and natural gas producer in the United States, accounting for 42 percent and 27 percent of the nation\u2019s total, respectively. Texas has 32 petroleum refineries, more than any other state, capable of processing more than 5.9 million barrels of crude oil per day, or 32 percent of U.S. refining capacity. Texas alone produces more than 12 percent of the nation\u2019s total electricity. Additionally, Texas has nearly 25 percent of U.S. dry natural gas reserves, meaning natural gas that has a high concentration of methane and no liquefiable hydrocarbon. In 2021, Texas liquefied natural gas terminals accounted for 50 percent of U.S. natural gas exports.\nNot only is Texas a national leader in energy production, but it also leads in energy consumption. In 2021, Texas consumed more than 14 trillion Btu (British thermal units, a measurement of heat content as energy), nearly twice that of the second-leading consumer of energy, California (Exhibit 1). Texas\u2019 industrial sector, including chemical manufacturing, natural gas extraction and petroleum refining, is the largest energy user, consuming more than half of the state\u2019s energy. As Texas\u2019 energy demand is higher than ever, the need to update the state\u2019s electricity infrastructure is of utmost importance. The availability of both fossil fuels and renewable energy is crucial for maintaining the dependability of the state\u2019s electrical grid.\nSource: U.S. Energy Information Administration\nDuring his latest Good for Texas Tour series, Hegar visited energy sites across Texas to explore their innovative efforts to bolster the state\u2019s diverse energy portfolio and meet the demands of a rapidly growing population and industry base.\nBoth fossil fuels and renewable energy sources play an important role in Texas\u2019 energy profile, which includes natural gas, coal, nuclear, wind, solar and biomass (Exhibit 2). Wind is the most-used renewable energy source in Texas; the state also ranks first nationally in wind energy production, accounting for 26 percent of the U.S. total, but it is intermittent by nature and thus cannot be relied upon as a sole source of power.\nFossil fuels such as natural gas provide the greatest portion of reliable, dispatchable energy and are particularly crucial when renewable energy is not available. (Dispatchable energy is composed of sources of electricity that can be programmed or adjusted on demand based on market needs.) Natural gas is abundant and is the state\u2019s largest single source of power, providing 41.8 percent of Texas\u2019 electric-generating capacity in 2023, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). Texas leads the country in natural gas production, accounting for more than one-fourth of the nation\u2019s natural gas production in 2022, and it supports the global economy with its natural gas exports.\nSource: U.S. Energy Information Administration\nIn November 2023, Texas voters approved Proposition 7, a constitutional amendment to establish the Texas Energy Fund to support the reliability of the state\u2019s electric grid, with a focus on natural gas. The Texas Legislature appropriated $5 billion to the new fund contingent on voter approval of the amendment. Senate Bill 2627, enabling legislation for the amendment, allows the Public Utility Commission (PUC) to award grants and loans to support Texas\u2019 dispatchable energy fleet through construction of new natural gas power plants and improvements to existing natural gas power plants.\nThe effort of this amendment is twofold: to increase generation of dispatchable electricity to improve grid reliability and help reverse the trend of an aging dispatchable energy infrastructure. About 41 percent of Texas\u2019 thermal power generation \u2015 a category including natural gas, nuclear and coal \u2015 comes from facilities that are more than three decades old according to information collected by ERCOT.\nIn addition to state-funded efforts to increase grid reliability, federal incentives such as Residential Clean Energy Credits have kicked off greater interest in battery storage capacity, which is particularly important to renewable energy. Battery storage is also receiving increased support from private projects, like the completion of battery developer Plus Power\u2019s $1.8 billion financing package to incorporate renewables and stabilize the power grid including supporting the construction of 700 megawatts (MW) of batteries on ERCOT\u2019s grid. Improvements in technology and further development of battery storage in Texas will play an increasing part in grid reliability as our state\u2019s population continues to grow.\nTexas has been affected by a nationwide shortage of electrical distribution transformers, used to convert transmission line voltage into usable electricity for homes and businesses, typically through utility poles or underground power lines. This shortage is caused by the U.S.\u2019 lack of ability to produce needed amounts of grain-oriented electrical steel, which is needed to make transformers, leading the country to seek transformers from other countries instead. The lack of transformer availability has caused electric grid expansions and construction to pause, or in some cases, cancel. Wait times and costs to receive transformers continue to increase drastically. For example, in 2023, only six out of 149 transformers were supplied for an order placed in June 2022 by New Braunfels Utilities, the power provider for th\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar recognized the importance of building on the strength of the state\u2019s infrastructure in his Good for Texas Tour: Energy Edition which highlighted key energy components that keep the state economy running.\nAlthough there\u2019s work to do, there\u2019s a lot to build on. Texas is the largest oil and natural gas producer in the United States, accounting for 42 percent and 27 percent of the nation\u2019s total, respectively. Texas has 32 petroleum refineries, more than any other state, capable of processing more than 5.9 million barrels of crude oil per day, or 32 percent of U.S. refining capacity. Texas alone produces more than 12 percent of the nation\u2019s total electricity. Additionally, Texas has nearly 25 percent of U.S. dry natural gas reserves, meaning natural gas that has a high concentration of methane and no liquefiable hydrocarbon. In 2021, Texas liquefied natural gas terminals accounted for 50 percent of U.S. natural gas exports.\nNot only is Texas a national leader in energy production, but it also leads in energy consumption. In 2021, Texas consumed more than 14 trillion Btu (British thermal units, a measurement of heat content as energy), nearly twice that of the second-leading consumer of energy, California (Exhibit 1). Texas\u2019 industrial sector, including chemical manufacturing, natural gas extraction and petroleum refining, is the largest energy user, consuming more than half of the state\u2019s energy. As Texas\u2019 energy demand is higher than ever, the need to update the state\u2019s electricity infrastructure is of utmost importance. The availability of both fossil fuels and renewable energy is crucial for maintaining the dependability of the state\u2019s electrical grid.\nSource: U.S. Energy Information Administration\nDuring his latest Good for Texas Tour series, Hegar visited energy sites across Texas to explore their innovative efforts to bolster the state\u2019s diverse energy portfolio and meet the demands of a rapidly growing population and industry base.\nBoth fossil fuels and renewable energy sources play an important role in Texas\u2019 energy profile, which includes natural gas, coal, nuclear, wind, solar and biomass (Exhibit 2). Wind is the most-used renewable energy source in Texas; the state also ranks first nationally in wind energy production, accounting for 26 percent of the U.S. total, but it is intermittent by nature and thus cannot be relied upon as a sole source of power.\nFossil fuels such as natural gas provide the greatest portion of reliable, dispatchable energy and are particularly crucial when renewable energy is not available. (Dispatchable energy is composed of sources of electricity that can be programmed or adjusted on demand based on market needs.) Natural gas is abundant and is the state\u2019s largest single source of power, providing 41.8 percent of Texas\u2019 electric-generating capacity in 2023, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). Texas leads the country in natural gas production, accounting for more than one-fourth of the nation\u2019s natural gas production in 2022, and it supports the global economy with its natural gas exports.\nSource: U.S. Energy Information Administration\nIn November 2023, Texas voters approved Proposition 7, a constitutional amendment to establish the Texas Energy Fund to support the reliability of the state\u2019s electric grid, with a focus on natural gas. The Texas Legislature appropriated $5 billion to the new fund contingent on voter approval of the amendment. Senate Bill 2627, enabling legislation for the amendment, allows the Public Utility Commission (PUC) to award grants and loans to support Texas\u2019 dispatchable energy fleet through construction of new natural gas power plants and improvements to existing natural gas power plants.\nThe effort of this amendment is twofold: to increase generation of dispatchable electricity to improve grid reliability and help reverse the trend of an aging dispatchable energy infrastructure. About 41 percent of Texas\u2019 thermal power generation \u2015 a category including natural gas, nuclear and coal \u2015 comes from facilities that are more than three decades old according to information collected by ERCOT.\nIn addition to state-funded efforts to increase grid reliability, federal incentives such as Residential Clean Energy Credits have kicked off greater interest in battery storage capacity, which is particularly important to renewable energy. Battery storage is also receiving increased support from private projects, like the completion of battery developer Plus Power\u2019s $1.8 billion financing package to incorporate renewables and stabilize the power grid including supporting the construction of 700 megawatts (MW) of batteries on ERCOT\u2019s grid. Improvements in technology and further development of battery storage in Texas will play an increasing part in grid reliability as our state\u2019s population continues to grow.\nTexas has been affected by a nationwide shortage of electrical distribution transformers, used to convert transmission line voltage into usable electricity for homes and businesses, typically through utility poles or underground power lines. This shortage is caused by the U.S.\u2019 lack of ability to produce needed amounts of grain-oriented electrical steel, which is needed to make transformers, leading the country to seek transformers from other countries instead. The lack of transformer availability has caused electric grid expansions and construction to pause, or in some cases, cancel. Wait times and costs to receive transformers continue to increase drastically. For example, in 2023, only six out of 149 transformers were supplied for an order placed in June 2022 by New Braunfels Utilities, the power provider for th\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The final report includes additional details regarding the need to strengthen rules for cold weather preparedness and coordination to prevent a recurrence of last winter\u2019s blackouts.\nIn February 2021, a severe cold weather event \u2013 also known as Winter Storm Uri \u2013 caused numerous outages, derates or failures to start at electric generating plants scattered across the region. The Texas grid operator (Electric Reliability Council of Texas or ERCOT) ordered a total of 20,000 MW of rolling blackouts in an effort to prevent grid collapse; this represents the largest manually controlled load shedding event in U.S. history. More than 4.5 million people in Texas lost power \u2013 some for as long as four days. Tragically, the loss of electricity caused the deaths of numerous Texans.\n\u201cThe final report on Winter Storm Uri is a sobering analysis that highlights the significant work that needs to be done. I previously committed to take the recommendations seriously, and I plan to do exactly that,\u201d FERC Chairman Rich Glick said. \u201cThe devastating effects of extreme cold on our bulk power system\u2019s ability to operate in 2011 and now, 2021, must not be allowed to happen again. We have a duty to protect the bulk power system and public safety and we will do just that.\u201d\n\u201cExtreme weather events, such as the one in February 2021, are unfortunately becoming more commonplace and the electricity ecosystem needs to come together to plan for and prepare to operate under more extreme, longer duration, and wide area weather events,\u201d NERC President and Chief Executive Officer Jim Robb said. \u201cThe FERC-NERC-Regional Entity Staff Report also highlights the need for substantially better coordination between the natural gas system and the electric system to ensure a reliable supply that nearly 400 million people across North America depend upon to support their way of life.\u201d\nToday\u2019s final report highlights the critical need for stronger mandatory electric reliability standards, particularly with respect to generator cold weather-critical components and systems. Notably, a combination of freezing issues (44.2 percent) and fuel issues (31.4 percent) caused 75.6 percent of the unplanned generating unit outages, derates and failures to start. Of particular note, protecting just four types of power plant components from icing and freezing could have reduced outages by 67 percent in the ERCOT region, 47 percent in the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) and 55 percent in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator South (MISO) regions. Natural gas-fired units represented 58 percent of all generating units experiencing unplanned outages, derates or failures to start. The remaining portion was comprised of wind (27 percent), coal (6 percent), solar (2 percent) and other generation types (7 percent), with four nuclear units making up less than 1 percent.\nToday\u2019s final report provides more details:\nThe Final Report includes 28 formal recommendations that seek to prevent a recurrence of the failures experienced during the February 2021 cold weather event. These recommendations include important revisions to the NERC Reliability Standards surrounding generator winterization and gas-electric coordination.\nAdditional recommendations are included regarding topics such as cold weather impacts on mechanical and electrical components, utilization of weather forecasts to better predict electric demand, and increasing the ability to rotate rolling blackouts, amongst other recommendations. The report also encourages additional study of the ERCOT system\u2019s reliability issues, guidance on identification of natural gas infrastructure for protection from rolling blackouts, and additional ways to address natural gas fuel supply shortfalls during extreme cold weather events.\nThe full report is available here.\nThe presentation of the preliminary findings released in September 2021 is available here.\nR22-6\nThis page was last updated on November 16, 2021\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Some Houston-area residents haven\u2019t had power since Monday morning, as the region enters its second day of below-freezing temperatures.\nHouston Public Media spoke with Dan Cohan, a professor of environmental engineering at Rice University, to learn more about what led to these widespread power outages and if they could have been prevented.\nRead or listen to our interview with him below, edited for length and clarity.\nTo embed this piece of audio in your site, please use this code:\nLarge swaths of Texas have experienced blackouts in the past day. Could you explain what led to these widespread power outages?\nWhat\u2019s happening now is that demand is at record highs as we\u2019re trying to keep our homes warm in the coldest freeze that we\u2019ve had in three decades. Demand for power right now is around 70 gigawatts and power plants in Texas right now can only supply about 45 gigawatts.\nAnd so the system simply isn\u2019t able to handle demand at the level it is, mostly because so many power plants are down right now. People are trying to keep their homes warm. Yet power plants aren\u2019t able to operate the way they normally do both because they weren\u2019t designed to operate well in freezing cold conditions and freezing rain conditions, and because many of the natural gas power plants aren\u2019t able to get enough gas to burn.\nBeyond the current conditions that are limiting operations and driving up demand, is there anything unique about Texas' energy infrastructure that has led us to this moment?\nWhat makes it challenging to handle this is that we don\u2019t have options that might give us more flexibility. We can\u2019t import power from other states because we have so few lines connecting the Texas grid to our neighboring states. When it comes to electricity, what happens in Texas stays in Texas. Because Texas made a decision many decades ago to have its own power grid that wouldn\u2019t connect to the rest of the country, in part because we didn\u2019t want federal rules telling us the way Texas would handle things. And we\u2019re paying the price for that now. Because just when we need the power most, we\u2019re not able to import any of it from our neighboring states.\nFROM THE TEXAS TRIBUNE | Why Does Texas Have Its Own Power Grid?\nTexas relies heavily on natural gas. But what about the other energy sources?\nIn general, the state gets around half of its power from natural gas, and around 20% from wind, around 20% from coal and most of the rest from nuclear. And usually it leads to pretty reliable power because usually wind and solar are able to generate as much as they can, and natural gas adjusts to be able to meet the ups and downs of wind and solar and of when we need power the most.\nWhat\u2019s happening now is what has traditionally been thought of as a viable source of power \u2014 natural gas \u2014 has been struggling. There\u2019s record demand for natural gas, not just from power plants, but also from burning natural gas directly in our homes and offices.\nLooking beyond right here, right now and keeping the bigger picture in mind, what can Texas do to prevent blackouts like this during cold weather weather events in the future?\nThere is no one silver bullet to keep this from happening again, we\u2019re going to need a menu of options. We\u2019re going to need to better insulate (and) weatherize our homes so that we can bring down the demand. We need to think about building some transmission lines to connect our isolated island with other states to be able to trade power. We need to have more storage on the grid \u2014 at the moment, there\u2019s only a very tiny, tiny amount of power that can be stored in batteries.\nAnd we need to be sure we\u2019re maintaining a diversified supply, especially during daytime \u2014 now, solar panels are working great, but we don\u2019t have many of them in the state. Having wind turbines in different parts of the state means that if we have icing conditions in some areas, then wind turbines can be operating well in others. So I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s an all-of-the-above approach, but it\u2019s not going to be a single approach.\nWhat do you think Texas can learn from the historic winter conditions and widespread power outages happening today?\nIf you had asked me a year ago whether to plan for an event like this, I would have thought this was very unlikely. Overall with climate change, warming is happening more strongly in the wintertime. In the 1970s, freezing events \u2014 nights that got below 32 \u00b0F \u2014 happened five times as often as they do today.\nSo most of the time when we\u2019re thinking about resiliency planning, we\u2019re thinking about preparing for the hottest summer afternoons, which are getting hotter than they ever were before.\nSo I think this event is going to tell us that even though we have this warming happening, we still do need to be prepared for winter freeze events and perhaps stronger winter freeze events than we thought seemed possible.\nHave a News Tip?

That timeline showed the grid was just 4 minutes and 37 seconds away from a cascading series of events that could have left Texas in the dark for weeks \u2014 if not longer.\nTo keep the grid running, officials said, operators need to have enough power to maintain a constant frequency of around 60 hertz (you can learn more about that here). But on the evening of Sunday, Feb. 14, temperatures were falling, snow and ice were blanketing Texas, and people were turning up their thermostats.\nMeanwhile, power plants across the state were going offline because of the cold weather; natural gas, coal, nuclear and wind energy sources were all failing. Equipment and pipelines were freezing up. At 12:15 a.m. Monday, ERCOT went to its first level of energy emergency alert.\nRELATED | Here Are Some Terms You Need To Know To Understand The Debate Over The Texas Blackout\nBut that wasn\u2019t enough. At 1:07 a.m., ERCOT went to the second level. This triggered some power reductions for industrial customers that volunteer to have power turned off when supply gets scarce.\nThings kept getting worse. By 1:23 a.m., one-third of the state\u2019s power-generation capacity was down. The highest alert was triggered, and ERCOT ordered power providers to start rolling blackouts.\nIf there\u2019s not enough power on the grid to meet demand, ERCOT officials said, the frequency of the grid drops below that 60 hertz level. That can cause physical damage to equipment that moves power around the state. And it can force more power plants to shut down \u2014 possibly leading to a complete failure of the grid.\nBut those initial rolling blackouts didn\u2019t solve the problem.\nStill more power plants went offline because of the weather. And by 1:43 a.m. Monday, the frequency of the grid was falling to dangerous levels. At about 1:51 a.m., the grid dropped below 59.4 hertz. That may not sound much different than 60 hertz, but if the frequency stayed under that threshold for 9 minutes or more, ERCOT officials said, it would trigger that cascading failure of the grid.\nWithin minutes, the frequency fell to about 59.3 hertz. Grid operators told power providers to expand rolling blackouts again.\nFour minutes and 23 seconds after it dipped below 59.4 hertz, the frequency began to rise as more customers were dumped from the grid. If it had stayed below that threshold for another 4 minutes and 37 seconds, the lights might still be out in Texas, ERCOT officials said.\n\u201cThat is the thing that we cannot allow to happen,\u201d said Bill Magness, ERCOT\u2019s president and CEO, told the board Wednesday. \u201cBecause if we have a blackout of the system, the system is out for an indeterminate amount of time. We may still be here today talking about when is the power going to come back on if we had let the system get into that condition.\u201d\nBy about 2:03 a.m., the grid was back at or above 60 hertz. But by that time, there was not enough power being produced to undo the blackouts \u2014 and as many of us know, some of the lights would stay out for days, until more power plants came back online.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

That timeline showed the grid was just 4 minutes and 37 seconds away from a cascading series of events that could have left Texas in the dark for weeks \u2014 if not longer.\nTo keep the grid running, officials said, operators need to have enough power to maintain a constant frequency of around 60 hertz (you can learn more about that here).
