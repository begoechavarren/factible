    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nWhat if I told you that someone had developed an energy source that could help us solve our biggest environmental challenges, purify our water and air, make our cities and homes more sanitary, and keep us safe from potential catastrophic climate change? What if I also told you that this energy source was cheap, plentiful, and reliable? Well, there is such a source. You probably know it as fossil fuel. Oil. Natural gas. Coal. But wait? Don\u2019t fossil fuels pollute our environment and make our climate unlivable? That, of course, is what we\u2019re told\u2026and what our children are taught. But let\u2019s look at the data. Here\u2019s a graph you\u2019ve probably never seen: the correlation between use of fossil fuels and access to clean water. More fossil fuel. More clean water. Am I saying the more we that we have used fossil fuel, the cleaner our water has become? Yes, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying. In the developed world, we take clean water for granted. We turn on a tap and it\u2019s there. But getting it there takes a massive amount of energy. Think of the man-made reservoirs, the purification plants, the network of pipes. In the undeveloped world, it\u2019s a much different story. They lack the energy, so they lack clean water. More fossil fuel. More clean water. The same is true of sanitation. By the use of cheap, plentiful, and reliable energy from fossil fuels, we have made our environment cleaner. Take a look at this graph. More fossil fuel. Better sanitation. Okay, what about air quality? Here\u2019s a graph of the air pollution trends in the United States over the last half century based on data from the Environmental Protection Agency. Note the dramatic downward trend in emissions, even though we use more fossil fuel than ever. How was this achieved? Above all, by using anti-pollution technology powered by\u2026 fossil fuel: oil, natural gas and coal. But even without modern pollution control technology, fossil fuel makes our air cleaner. Indoor pollution\u2014caused by burning a fire inside your house, cabin, hut or tent to cook and keep warm\u2014was a deadly global problem until the late 19th century when cheap kerosene, a fossil fuel byproduct, became available in America and Europe. Indoor pollution is still a major issue in the developing world today. The best solution? Fossil fuel. And now we come to the biggest fossil fuel concern of all\u2014global warming. On this very sensitive topic we need to get our terms straight: There is a big difference between mild global warming and catastrophic global warming. We can all agree on that, right? The issue isn\u2019t: does burning fossil fuel have some warming impact? It does. The issue is: is the climate warming dangerously fast? In 1986 NASA climate scientist James Hansen\u2014one of the world\u2019s most prominent critics of the use of fossil fuels\u2014predicted that \u201cif current trends are unchanged,\u201d temperatures would rise 2 to 4 degrees in the first decade of the 2000s. But as you can see from this graph, since 2000 the trend line is essentially flat\u2014little or no warming in the last 15 years. That\u2019s probably why we hear much less talk about \u201cglobal warming\u201d and much more talk about \u201cclimate change.\u201d Has this \u201cclimate change\u201d made our world more dangerous? The key statistic here, one that is, unfortunately, almost never mentioned, is \u201cclimate-related deaths,\u201d that is, how many people die each year from a climate-related cause, including droughts, floods, storms, and extreme temperatures. In the last eighty years, as CO2 emissions have rapidly escalated, the annual rate of climate-related deaths worldwide has rapidly declined -- by 98%. The reason is that the energy from fossil fuel has allowed the developed world to build a durable civilization, one highly resilient to extreme heat, extreme cold, floods, storms, and so on. The developing world\u2014where natural disasters can still wreak terrible havoc\u2014 would like the chance to do the same. But to do that they will need a lot more energy. The cheapest, fastest and easiest way to get that energy is from fossil fuels. In sum, fossil fuels don\u2019t take a naturally safe environment and make it dangerous; they empower us to take a naturally dangerous environment and make it cleaner and safer.

These plants generate 35 percent of all carbon dioxide emissions in the United States.\nA Stanford study finds that methane emissions from natural gas leaks could be greatly reduced by targeting \u201csuper emitters.\u201d (Image credit: Shutterstock)\nClimate scientists say we need to reduce global emissions by about 4 percent a year, going to zero emissions, or even negative emissions, before the end of the century. But emissions-free technologies like wind, solar and nuclear may not be able to address the problem quickly enough.\nIn developing economies, the demand for cheap and reliable electricity from fossil fuels continues to grow, generating even more greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. But from an environmental standpoint, not all fossil fuels are created equal.\nNatural gas is primarily methane. When burnt, methane emits about half as much CO2 as a coal. In the last 10 years, the United States has seen a boom in the production of low-cost natural gas, which many electrical utilities are adopting as a cleaner alternative to coal.\nStanford researchers are exploring novel ways of satisfying our current energy needs with greener technologies for burning fossil fuels . Explore fossil fuel research at Stanford.\nBut one drawback of natural gas is the leakage of uncombusted methane, a far more potent greenhouse gas than CO2. Stanford faculty members Rob Jackson and Adam Brandt in the School of Earth, Energy and Environmental Sciences have been identifying the wells and pipes where those leaks are most likely to occur so that industry can prevent them. They\u2019ve found that a small number of wells produce most of the leaked methane.\nTo better understand the benefits and risks of increasing natural gas production, the Precourt Institute and the School of Earth created the Natural Gas Initiative (NGI), a campus-wide research program launched in 2015.\nOne key area of NGI research focuses on unconventional gas reservoirs and how they can be better managed to increase the gas-recovery rate, now well below 20 percent, said NGI Director Mark Zoback. By increasing recovery, gas production can be maintained with fewer land-use impacts, he added.\nBeyond switching from coal to natural gas, another approach for reducing emissions from fossil fuels is to capture the carbon dioxide and store it underground in deep geological formations, a technique known as carbon capture and sequestration.\nWith support from the Global Climate and Energy Project (GCEP), Lynn Orr, Sally Benson and other Stanford faculty members helped establish the scientific basis for safe and effective sequestration, including monitoring techniques demonstrating that captured CO2 is permanently trapped underground. Hamdi Tchelepi, a professor of energy resources engineering, uses supercomputers to study how injected CO2 gas interacts with rock and fluids underground. In addition to permanently sequestering CO2, Stanford faculty explore using the gas for sustainable purposes, like making renewable plastic.\nAs the world continues to burn 100 million barrels of oil a day \u2013 a rate that is expected to continue for the next 50 years \u2013 Stanford Earth researchers are developing greener ways of extracting the oil and mitigating the resulting greenhouse gases.\nThe land under our feet and the plant matter it contains could offset a significant amount of carbon emissions if managed properly. More research is needed to unlock soil\u2019s potential to mitigate global warming, improve crop yields and increase resilience to extreme weather.\nNew research finds far more abandoned oil and gas wells in Pennsylvania than previously thought and provides a framework for identifying wells across the United States and globally that are the worst methane leakers.\nNew findings by Stanford engineering Professor Alfred Spormann and colleagues could pave the way for microbial \"factories\" that produce renewable biofuels and chemicals.\nStanford University's Natural Gas Initiative will research many questions related to the responsible development of natural gas as a fuel supply in the United States and around the world.\nThe results, published in Nature, could pave the way to the cleaner production of methanol, an important industrial feedstock and potential green fuel.\nA new study finds that just a few natural gas wells account for more than half of the total volume of leaked methane gas in the United States. Fixing leaks at those top emitters could significantly reduce leaks of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.\n2016 marked the third year in a row when global CO2 emissions remained relatively flat, but actual declines won\u2019t materialize without advances in technology and growth in renewables.\nA new software tool can help reduce the risk of triggering manmade earthquakes by calculating the probability that oil and gas production activities will trigger slip in nearby faults.\nDetailed analysis about the role of natural gas in national and international energy plans.\nAs the world shifts from fossil fuels, additional sources of energy-on-demand will be needed to make up for lulls in wind or solar. A new way of extracting uranium from seawater could help even countries without uranium mines harness nuclear power in the post-carbon energy future.\nTaking a cue from plants, researchers figure out how to use the sun's energy to combine CO2 with H2O to create benign chemical products, as part of a futuristic technology called artificial photosynthesis.\nThe new technology could provide a green alternative to petroleum-based plastic bottles and other polyester products.\nStanford scientists exp\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Water is also at the heart of adaptation to climate change, serving as the crucial link between society and the environment.\nWater is also a rights issue. As the global population grows, there is an increasing need to balance all of the competing commercial demands on water resources, so that communities have enough for their needs. In particular, women and girls must have access to clean, private sanitation facilities to manage menstruation and maternity in dignity and safety.\nAt the human level, water cannot be seen in isolation from sanitation. Together, they are vital for reducing the global burden of disease and improving the health, education and economic productivity of populations.\nOne of the most important recent milestones has been the recognition in July 2010 by the United Nations General Assembly of the human right to water and sanitation. The Assembly recognized the right of every human being to have access to enough water for personal and domestic uses, meaning between 50 and 100 litres of water per person per day. The water must be safe, acceptable and affordable. The water costs should not exceed 3 per cent of household income. Moreover, the water source has to be within 1,000 metres of the home and collection time should not exceed 30 minutes.\nSustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 is to \u201cEnsure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all\u201d. The targets cover all aspects of both the water cycle and sanitation systems, and their achievement is designed to contribute to progress across a range of other SDGs, most notably on health, education, economics and the environment.\nThe United Nations has long been addressing the global crisis caused by insufficient water supply to satisfy basic human needs and growing demands on the world\u2019s water resources to meet human, commercial and agricultural needs.\nThe United Nations Water Conference (1977), the International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade (1981-1990), the International Conference on Water and the Environment (1992) and the Earth Summit (1992) \u2014 all focused on this vital resource.\nThe \u2018Water for Life\u2019 International Decade for Action 2005-2015 helped around 1.3 billion people in developing countries gain access to safe drinking water and drove progress on sanitation as part of the effort to meet the Millennium Development Goals.\nThe International Decade (2018\u20132028) for Action, \u2018Water for Sustainable Development\u2019, is helping put a greater focus on water in the approach to the end of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nThe UN 2023 Water Conference adopted the Water Action Agenda, which represents voluntary commitments by nations and stakeholders to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their water-related targets. This led directly to the development of the first-ever UN System-wide Strategy for Water and Sanitation, launched in 2024, which will maximize support to countries to accelerate progress.\nRecent milestone agreements include the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the 2015-2030 Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, the 2015 Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development, and the 2015 Paris Agreement within the UN Convention Framework on Climate Change.\nContaminated water, inadequate sanitation, and poor hygiene practices are undermining efforts to end extreme poverty and control disease outbreaks in the world\u2019s poorest countries.\nWithout safely managed water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services, people\u2019s wellbeing, dignity and opportunities are severely impacted, particularly women and girls.\nAccording to WHO, at least 1.7 billion people worldwide are estimated to drink water that is not protected against contamination from faeces. Even more drink water delivered through systems without adequate protection against sanitary hazards.\nThe infectious diseases, such as cholera, that spread through unsafe water from improperly disposed human waste and poor hygiene practices have a profound effect on high rates of infant mortality, malnutrition and chronic illness in the general population.\nThe links between lack of safe water and sanitation access and development goals are well established, and the solutions to the problem are known and cost-effective. A 2012 WHO study showed that every US $1 invested in improved sanitation translates into an average global economic return of US $5.5. Those benefits are experienced specifically by poor children and in the disadvantaged communities that need them most.\nEvery year, there are two UN international observances on water and sanitation: World Water Day, 22 March and World Toilet Day, 19 November. Each day is marked by a global public campaign which is about raising awareness of the issues and inspiring action.\nOver the years, World Water Day and World Toilet Day have focused on an array of themes, including health, culture, jobs, food, energy, disasters, peace and much more.\nIn 2026, both Observances will campaign on the vital role of water and sanitation in gender equality.\nRead more about water.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Fossil fuels are silently wreaking havoc on our environment, and the consequences are more severe than most people realize.\nFossil fuels are literally relics of the past. Think of them as nature\u2019s time capsules\u2014ancient plants and animals that got squished and cooked underground for millions of years. The result? Coal, oil, and natural gas. These energy-packed substances have been powering our world since the Industrial Revolution, and they\u2019re the main culprits behind our overheating planet.\nAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, fossil fuels make up about 79% of total U.S. primary energy production in 2022. They\u2019ve gotten us to where we are today, but it\u2019s time to upgrade to cleaner alternatives.\nNow, let\u2019s talk about the elephant in the room\u2014or, more accurately, the smog in the air. When we burn fossil fuels, we release a cocktail of pollutants into our atmosphere. The carbon dioxide produced is the primary culprit behind our overheating planet, acting as a blanket that lets in the light from the sun, but keeps the heat from getting out.\nOther byproducts like sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter also join the party, contributing to acid rain, smog, and respiratory issues. According to Bloomberg, as many as 1 in 10 American deaths today are caused by air pollution.\nBut the pollution doesn\u2019t stop at the air\u2014it is also causing quite a stir in our water. Harmful byproducts of fossil fuels make it into the water we drink. Fracking, a method used to extract natural gas, has been linked to groundwater pollution. A study found that in areas with shale gas development, there is 17 times more methane in the drinking water. And let\u2019s not forget about coal ash ponds and acid mine drainage, which sound like rejected supervillain lairs but are actually real threats to our rivers and streams, with the EPA identifying over 1,000 contaminated sites related to coal ash in the U.S. alone.\nThe environmental impacts of fossil fuels extend far beyond air and water pollution. Climate change due to carbon pollution causes the planet\u2019s rising temperatures, extreme weather events, wildfires, and rising sea levels.\nMining and drilling for fossil fuels destroys animal habitats, and the ocean becoming more acidic threatens marine life. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) states that the ocean absorbs about 30% of the CO2 released into the atmosphere, leading to a 30% increase in ocean acidity since the Industrial Revolution.\nThe use of dirty fossil fuel energy directly causes a lot of the environmental damage we see today. Thankfully, we can upgrade to clean energy, which has become much less expensive.\nThe cost of solar has fallen by 90% over the last decade, and the cost of wind by 70%. Many countries are also setting ambitious clean energy targets, with the United States promising to reduce emissions by 50% by 2030.\nWe\u2019re already upgrading to cleaner, safer, faster energy.

Water is also at the heart of adaptation to climate change, serving as the crucial link between society and the environment.\nWater is also a rights issue. As the global population grows, there is an increasing need to balance all of the competing commercial demands on water resources, so that communities have enough for their needs. In particular, women and girls must have access to clean, private sanitation facilities to manage menstruation and maternity in dignity and safety.\nAt the human level, water cannot be seen in isolation from sanitation. Together, they are vital for reducing the global burden of disease and improving the health, education and economic productivity of populations.\nOne of the most important recent milestones has been the recognition in July 2010 by the United Nations General Assembly of the human right to water and sanitation. The Assembly recognized the right of every human being to have access to enough water for personal and domestic uses, meaning between 50 and 100 litres of water per person per day. The water must be safe, acceptable and affordable. The water costs should not exceed 3 per cent of household income. Moreover, the water source has to be within 1,000 metres of the home and collection time should not exceed 30 minutes.\nSustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 is to \u201cEnsure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all\u201d. The targets cover all aspects of both the water cycle and sanitation systems, and their achievement is designed to contribute to progress across a range of other SDGs, most notably on health, education, economics and the environment.\nThe United Nations has long been addressing the global crisis caused by insufficient water supply to satisfy basic human needs and growing demands on the world\u2019s water resources to meet human, commercial and agricultural needs.\nThe United Nations Water Conference (1977), the International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade (1981-1990), the International Conference on Water and the Environment (1992) and the Earth Summit (1992) \u2014 all focused on this vital resource.\nThe \u2018Water for Life\u2019 International Decade for Action 2005-2015 helped around 1.3 billion people in developing countries gain access to safe drinking water and drove progress on sanitation as part of the effort to meet the Millennium Development Goals.\nThe International Decade (2018\u20132028) for Action, \u2018Water for Sustainable Development\u2019, is helping put a greater focus on water in the approach to the end of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nThe UN 2023 Water Conference adopted the Water Action Agenda, which represents voluntary commitments by nations and stakeholders to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their water-related targets. This led directly to the development of the first-ever UN System-wide Strategy for Water and Sanitation, launched in 2024, which will maximize support to countries to accelerate progress.\nRecent milestone agreements include the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the 2015-2030 Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, the 2015 Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development, and the 2015 Paris Agreement within the UN Convention Framework on Climate Change.\nContaminated water, inadequate sanitation, and poor hygiene practices are undermining efforts to end extreme poverty and control disease outbreaks in the world\u2019s poorest countries.\nWithout safely managed water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services, people\u2019s wellbeing, dignity and opportunities are severely impacted, particularly women and girls.\nAccording to WHO, at least 1.7 billion people worldwide are estimated to drink water that is not protected against contamination from faeces. Even more drink water delivered through systems without adequate protection against sanitary hazards.\nThe infectious diseases, such as cholera, that spread through unsafe water from improperly disposed human waste and poor hygiene practices have a profound effect on high rates of infant mortality, malnutrition and chronic illness in the general population.\nThe links between lack of safe water and sanitation access and development goals are well established, and the solutions to the problem are known and cost-effective. A 2012 WHO study showed that every US $1 invested in improved sanitation translates into an average global economic return of US $5.5. Those benefits are experienced specifically by poor children and in the disadvantaged communities that need them most.\nEvery year, there are two UN international observances on water and sanitation: World Water Day, 22 March and World Toilet Day, 19 November. Each day is marked by a global public campaign which is about raising awareness of the issues and inspiring action.\nOver the years, World Water Day and World Toilet Day have focused on an array of themes, including health, culture, jobs, food, energy, disasters, peace and much more.\nIn 2026, both Observances will campaign on the vital role of water and sanitation in gender equality.\nRead more about water.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Today, rural dwellers make up less than half of the global population. Still, as of 2024, roughly 3.44 billion people \u2014 nearly 44% of the world\u2019s population \u2014 continue to live in rural areas.\nThe decline in the share of rural populations \u2014 and the corresponding rise in urbanization\u2014 is a global trend seen across all regions. However, in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, rural areas still house the majority of the population. Sub-Saharan Africa is projected to become predominantly urban by 2036, while South Asia is expected to reach this milestone a decade later, by 2046\nRural populations remain disproportionately affected by poverty. Currently 80% of the poorest people who live on less than $2.15 per day live in rural areas. Achieving rural prosperity globally requires ensuring access to essential infrastructure services such as clean drinking water, modern cooking technologies, and reliable electricity.\nInvesting in rural infrastructure boosts productivity and helps shift economies beyond agriculture. This creates more jobs, raises incomes, and improves access to goods \u2014 reducing poverty. When access to basic services is more equal, income and rural-urban inequality also decline. Without it, poor communities often pay more for basic needs, like buying bottled water instead of having access to clean tap water.\nWhile global access to these essential services has steadily increased, stark inequalities persist between rural and urban populations across countries at different income levels, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa.\nGlobal access to safe water ensures good health and contributes to a prosperous society. Without access to clean drinking water, people face a high risk of waterborne diseases, some of which can be life-threatening. Generally, rural areas lag in access to safe drinking water compared to urban areas. In 2022, urban access to safe water (81 percent) was 19 percentage points higher than in rural areas (62 percent). Lack of specific attention to poor and vulnerable populations has allowed such gaps to persist.\nStark differences persist in low-income countries. Here, in 2022, less than 15 percent of rural dwellers had access to safely managed drinking water services compared to nearly 60 percent of urban dwellers.\nIn lower-middle income countries, the gap in access to safe drinking water has nearly closed over the last two decades: about 60 percent of both urban and rural populations have access to safe drinking water now. In fact, since 2000, access to urban residents hasn\u2019t changed but there has been a noticeable increase for rural residents, from 34 percent to 63 percent.\nEven in high-income countries, access to safe drinking water is uneven between urban and rural areas: while access to it is nearly universal (95 percent) in urban areas, 1 in 10 rural dwellers in high income countries still lack access to safe drinking water.\nWhen safe drinking water is readily available in rural areas, people no longer need to travel long distances to fetch it \u2014 saving time, reducing physical strain that can lead to chronic pain or disability, and improving overall productivity.\nAccess to electricity unlocks a range of opportunities: it provides lighting at night, helps manage extreme temperatures through heaters, fans, and refrigerators, and connects people to the wider world via phones and the internet. It also boosts productivity by powering appliances like washing machines and computers. Together, these benefits help integrate communities into the global economy, serving as a catalyst for economic development.\nIn 2000, more than 1.25 billion people lived without electricity. Over the last two decades, this number has nearly halved with 618 million people remaining without access to electricity. Of these, more than 500 million people live in rural areas.\nSince 2000, access to electricity in rural areas has improved significantly around the world. In regions like South Asia, Latin America & the Caribbean, and East Asia & the Pacific, the gap between urban and rural access has nearly closed. Even in the Middle East and North Africa, where disparities remain, there has been notable progress toward narrowing the divide.\nIn Sub-Saharan Africa, access to electricity has improved in both urban and rural areas. However, the gap between them remains wide \u2014 still hovering around 50 percentage points. In rural parts of the region, fewer than 2 in 5 people have access to electricity, highlighting a persistent and significant divide.\nFinally, access to electricity isn\u2019t as binary as it might seem.

However, population growth and enhanced living standards, together with the expansion of industrial and agricultural activities, are creating unprecedented demands on clean water supplies all over the world.\nLess than 0.5 percent of the water that covers 70 percent of our planet is fit for human consumption; the oceans account for 98 percent of all the water on Earth, and more than 1.5 percent of our water is locked up in ice caps and glaciers. Yet, in developed countries, we often take this most precious of natural resources for granted, despite the many campaigns we are exposed to reminding us that one in ten of the world\u2019s population has no access to safe drinking water. If you don\u2019t have clean water, you can\u2019t grow healthy food and you\u2019re more likely to be sick and unable to work or go to school, which means you are more likely to be trapped in poverty, with all the societal and security issues that poverty brings. Globally, one in five deaths of children under five is due to dirty water. Then factor in that the world's population tripled in the 20th century and is expected to increase by another 40-50 percent in the next 50 years; that industry and agriculture are placing unprecedented demands on clean water supplies, and that there isn't any more fresh water in the world today than there was a million years ago.\nAs water cannot be replaced in the same way that alternative fuel sources can replace fossil fuels, we urgently need to find new sources of water if we are to mitigate the impacts that the lack of clean water has on humanity. Tapping the seas is a popular option. Desalination of seawater is increasingly seen as the most practical solution and \u2014 for many countries \u2014 the only possible way to provide fresh water to meet increased demand due to population growth, expanding urbanization and industry. This is clearly reflected in the rapid development of water desalination technologies and their commercial exploitation in the last decades.\nHowever, despite the significant advances these technologies have brought about, and the successes they have made in reducing energy requirements (mainly in membrane-based processes), desalination remains an energy-intensive process that contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and subsequent impacts related to climate change. In countries across the Middle East and North Africa the situation is especially problematic in terms of experience, challenging sea water quality (especially in the Gulf) and energy use \u2014 the ready availability and limited cost of fossil fuels in these regions makes thermal-based processes more attractive. These energy-intensive processes dominate the desalination market, so there is tremendous interest in identifying breakthrough solutions that address water security and sustainability at a lower cost, while also being more environmentally friendly. That\u2019s the challenge that faces us. How can we provide enough clean, safe water to meet humanity\u2019s ever-growing needs, and do so with lower energy requirements, greenhouse gas emissions, and adverse climate impacts? There is an urgent need to undertake fundamental research in the water sciences to advance the development of water technologies so that we can deliver innovative solutions to address water security and the sustainability of finite water resources.\nOur objective should be to explore the development of new and emerging low-energy and renewable energy-driven desalination technologies, targeting a reduction in the specific energy consumption of seawater desalination and developing more sustainable desalination processes that are less dependent on conventional energy sources and that, consequently, are more environmentally friendly. But there are so many other questions we need to find answers to. What are the novel technologies for water desalination and reuse that we need to develop and exploit? How can we optimize and hybridize desalination and reuse technologies to deliver enhanced performance? How do we promote (and incentivize?) water technologies for sustainable urban, agricultural, and industrial applications? What research into urban and natural hydrologic systems is needed to improve our understanding and management of water resources? And how do we ensure that the results of this research reach the widest possible audience so that we can begin to address these challenges on a global scale?\nIf we can answer some of these questions and find a way to provide clean, safe water to everyone, irrespective of geographic and economic constraints, then we will, without doubt, improve the health, wellbeing, and prosperity of billions of people.\nWater security is the biggest challenge we face.\nNidal Hilal, DSc, PhD, CEng, FIChemE, FLSW, is a Professor of Engineering and Director of the NYUAD Water Research Center at NYU Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, and Founding Director of CWATER at Swansea University, United Kingdom.\nProfessor Nidal Hilal will be speaking at \u2018In the Future, How will we Live?\u2019, a programme of events hosted by the UK Pavilion at Expo 2020 Dubai from 11-18th January.

The negative impacts that non-renewable energy sources like fossil fuels have on air quality, climate change, and environmental health have become increasingly clear. By increasingly relying on renewable energy sources like wind and solar power, we can reap a wide variety of benefits including reduced air pollution, lower greenhouse gas emission levels, decreased healthcare costs, a more resilient electrical grid, and job generation.\nThe UN says that with technology available today, cheap electricity from renewable sources could provide 65 percent of the world\u2019s total electricity supply by 2030 and decarbonize 90 percent of the power sector by 2050, massively cutting carbon emissions and improving air quality. But what exactly is the relationship between energy production and air pollution? We\u2019ll take a deep dive into this topic and see that the benefits of investing in clean energy sources become even more compelling when both air quality and climate benefits are considered.\nNon-renewable energy comes from sources that cannot be replenished in our lifetime. The most common sources of non-renewable energy are carbon-containing fossil fuels, including coal, petroleum, and natural gas. According to data from the Central Intelligence Agency, more than 66% of world electric generation comes from fossil fuels today.\nIn contrast, renewable energy comes from sources that can be replenished faster than they are consumed.\nRenewable energy sources produce little to no greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change, even when considering their life cycle emissions that occur through each stage of the technology\u2019s use.\nAside from relying on dwindling and expensive resources, non-renewable energy sources \u2014 specifically, fossil fuel combustion \u2014 create vast harm by releasing toxic air pollution and greenhouse gases that threaten air quality and climate health.\nEstimates from Harvard calculate that air pollution from fossil fuels may be responsible for as many as one in five deaths worldwide. Air pollution from coal-fired power plants impacts not only people in the immediate vicinity but can travel long distances depending on the prevailing wind speed and direction and put large portions of the population at risk.\nThe most common renewable energy sources include wind, solar, and geothermal with two of the safest and most common being wind and solar.\nWind energy is created using wind turbines which can be placed anywhere with high-speed winds, including hilltops to open water. Wind energy is one of the cleanest sources of energy because wind turbines do not affect air pollution emissions in any direct way and do not need water for cooling.\nSolar energy, which uses solar or photovoltaic cells to convert sunlight into electricity, is also very clean in that it doesn\u2019t produce air pollutants or contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. However, the process of manufacturing solar panels may produce some emissions.\nGeothermal energy relies on the heat produced within the Earth. Water is injected deep underground and is heated by the Earth\u2019s molten interior and returns as hot water or steam; this steam is used to power a turbine to generate electricity. Geothermal energy produces only one-sixth of the carbon dioxide of a natural gas powerplant and little to no NO2 or SO2 pollution.\nWhile biomass is sometimes listed as a source of renewable energy, the American Lung Association opposes biomass combustion as a form of energy generation because this process creates particle pollution and releases other carcinogens. However, pyrolysis \u2014 where biomass is heated in an anaerobic environment without oxygen, breaking down into oils and gases \u2014 is a potential alternative to incineration that is known to produce fewer air pollutants than burning.\nAn exciting future may exist when it comes to nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion, a process where light elements are combined to form heavier elements and release energy in the process, made recent headlines due to a scientific breakthrough where scientists demonstrated a positive energy gain in the reaction for the first time.\nHowever, we\u2019re still far from being able to use nuclear fusion as a viable energy source. Though this process can not yet be practically applied commercially, it holds the potential for a clean, safe, carbon-free, and near-limitless source of energy in the future.\nRenewable energy use is growing across the globe but unfortunately still accounts for just a portion of overall energy generation.\nGlobally, even though fossil fuels still account for the majority of energy production, renewable energy sources now make up 29% of current electricity production.\nIn the United States, 29% of greenhouse gas emissions come from electricity production, particularly from fossil fuel combustion. However, the U.S. is increasing its use of nonfossil fuel sources of energy, with 21% of the country\u2019s energy consumption coming from renewable sources in 2020 \u2014 the highest share since the early 1900s.\nBy increasing the supply and use of renewable energy like wind and solar, we can replace carbon-intensive sources like fossil fuels and lower the amount of greenhouse gas emissions released.\nAir pollution is a severe global crisis, with the World Health Organi\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Water is injected deep underground and is heated by the Earth\u2019s molten interior and returns as hot water or steam; this steam is used to power a turbine to generate electricity.

The negative impacts that non-renewable energy sources like fossil fuels have on air quality, climate change, and environmental health have become increasingly clear. By increasingly relying on renewable energy sources like wind and solar power, we can reap a wide variety of benefits including reduced air pollution, lower greenhouse gas emission levels, decreased healthcare costs, a more resilient electrical grid, and job generation.\nThe UN says that with technology available today, cheap electricity from renewable sources could provide 65 percent of the world\u2019s total electricity supply by 2030 and decarbonize 90 percent of the power sector by 2050, massively cutting carbon emissions and improving air quality. But what exactly is the relationship between energy production and air pollution? We\u2019ll take a deep dive into this topic and see that the benefits of investing in clean energy sources become even more compelling when both air quality and climate benefits are considered.\nNon-renewable energy comes from sources that cannot be replenished in our lifetime. The most common sources of non-renewable energy are carbon-containing fossil fuels, including coal, petroleum, and natural gas. According to data from the Central Intelligence Agency, more than 66% of world electric generation comes from fossil fuels today.\nIn contrast, renewable energy comes from sources that can be replenished faster than they are consumed.\nRenewable energy sources produce little to no greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change, even when considering their life cycle emissions that occur through each stage of the technology\u2019s use.\nAside from relying on dwindling and expensive resources, non-renewable energy sources \u2014 specifically, fossil fuel combustion \u2014 create vast harm by releasing toxic air pollution and greenhouse gases that threaten air quality and climate health.\nEstimates from Harvard calculate that air pollution from fossil fuels may be responsible for as many as one in five deaths worldwide. Air pollution from coal-fired power plants impacts not only people in the immediate vicinity but can travel long distances depending on the prevailing wind speed and direction and put large portions of the population at risk.\nThe most common renewable energy sources include wind, solar, and geothermal with two of the safest and most common being wind and solar.\nWind energy is created using wind turbines which can be placed anywhere with high-speed winds, including hilltops to open water.
