    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\naccording to this i have to say remarkable piece that you just put up late last night read it in bed at midnight that the fbi was organizing the riots of january 6th well yes it certainly suggests that possibility and i'm hearing from people that this is the most important and the darkest investigative piece they've seen in years but the american people deserve the truth about 1-6 not just for the sake of ashley babbitt not just for the sake of the hundreds of people held in prison unjustly as a violation of human rights but for the sake of the 70 plus million people who are trump supporters or just against the corrupt ruling class who have effectively been labeled de facto domestic extremists by our own government and i believe the key that unlocks the truth to 1-6 is the following question to what extent were the main militia groups imputed to the 1-6 so-called capital siege to what extent was their infiltration of those groups by undercover agents or informants and to what extent when we see the unindicted co-conspirators who occupy senior positions in those groups to what extent are those people being spared prosecution on account of a prior relationship with the federal government those two questions create a thread and when we pull that thread the ugly truth of that event and perhaps even the country we live in will be exposed i gotta ask because it it may answer one of the great mysteries is this i think there are 14 000 hours of unreleased video footage from that day the administration is hiding from us do you think this is why i think that's certainly a possibility um it's it's extremely suspicious even going back to this so-called pipe bomber video remember the pipe bomber the capital pipeliner the fbi has been extremely suspicious in withholding evidence video evidence that could help and identify this bomber which presumably they want to do but if you may i'd like to make a general point and it really after seeing all this you have to ask yourself does the national security apparatus do anything but conspire against the american people i'm led to conclude that we cannot have a democracy everything in our politics will be fake and performative until we bring the national security state including the fbi to heal it's not a left issue it's not a right issue every politician who cares about our country should demand a church committee 2.0 immediately and people of good faith on the left should join it uh immediately darren b i appreciate your coming on signing the work you do at revolver.news thank you",

Horowitz announced today the release of a review examining the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s (FBI) handling of its confidential human sources (CHS) and intelligence collection efforts in the lead up to the events at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021.\nConsistent with OIG practice, in spring 2022 the OIG paused aspects of our review to ensure that the OIG\u2019s investigative work did not conflict with or compromise any ongoing DOJ criminal investigations or prosecutions. Having been informed by federal prosecutors last year that our review would no longer potentially interfere with pending criminal prosecutions, we resumed our work on this matter. In doing so, we were cognizant of the amount of time that had passed, as well as the number of non-DOJ OIG oversight reports that had been publicly released regarding the events of January 6. We determined that an area that had not yet been thoroughly reviewed by other entities was the FBI\u2019s direction and handling of its CHSs in the lead-up to and on January 6, and whether the FBI exploited its CHSs and other available information to determine the nature of threats in advance of the electoral vote certification on January 6. Accordingly, we focused our review on that topic.\nThe findings in today\u2019s report include:\nToday\u2019s report also details our findings regarding FBI CHSs who were in Washington, D.C., on January 6. Our review determined that none of these FBI CHSs was authorized by the FBI to enter the Capitol or a restricted area or to otherwise break the law on January 6, nor was any CHS directed by the FBI to encourage others to commit illegal acts on January 6. Our findings also include:\nThe DOJ OIG made one recommendation to the FBI to assess the policies and procedures it uses to prepare for events that it determines present potential domestic security issues. The FBI agreed with this recommendation.\nDepartment of Justice\nIn memory of OIG Special Agent William \"Buddy\" Sentner Privacy Policy | EEO Policy | Legal Policies & Disclaimers | No Fear Act | Vulnerability Disclosure | Sitemap\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",
