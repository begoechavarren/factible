    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nif you're thinking about leading a more active lifestyle you're not alone in recent years an increasing number of Americans have started participating in more sports fitness and recreation whether you're trying to get fit build muscle or you're just tired of the couch here are some changes you can expect along the way during that first workout you might feel more alert and energized because ramping up your heart rate means a boost in overall blood flow and oxygen to the brain but prepare yourself for the day after when you'll almost certainly get a case of Dom's short for delayed onset muscle soreness the soreness will persist for about 72 hours but the good news is you're less likely to get it again as long as you continue to regularly exercise those same muscles over the next few weeks you'll slowly start to ramp up production of mitochondria via a process called mitochondrial biogenesis mitochondria are the parts of your cells that convert carbs fat and protein and to feel that your muscles use to do their job like flexing contract after six to eight weeks studies have shown that people can increase their mitochondria by up to 50% with more mitochondria in your cells you'll start to feel more fit and your endurance will increase so running three miles will no longer feel as difficult as it did during the first week once your six months in all of that hard work should finally start to show if your workouts focus on strength training you'll notice your muscles begin to take shape you're also less likely to fall off the workout wagon at this point exercise programs often see a 50% dropout rate within the first six months but after that more people stick with it now if you're more focused on cardio than by nine months of regular exercise you should see about a 25% increase in your vo2 max vo2 max is often used as a measure of fitness and refers to the rate your body can transport oxygen to your muscles for fuel basically higher vo2 max means you can run faster for longer so a 25% increase means you can run about 20% further in the same amount of time after one year of regular exercise your bones will be denser which reduces your of osteoporosis in fact researchers have found that regular resistance training when combined with aerobic exercise can actually reverse the effects of osteoporosis after 12 months now if you maintain your exercise program long term your body might not be the only thing to benefit your bank account may also be one study revealed that older people who exercise 5 days a week for at least 30 minutes saved on average $2,500 a year in medical costs for heart related health problems alone you'll also be at a lower risk of developing arthritis type-2 diabetes dementia and certain types of cancer like breast and colon in all probability you are going to live longer than you otherwise would and that longer life it will likely feel more fulfilling because exercise lowers the risk of anxiety and depression by reducing levels of stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline of course all of these benefits depend on the type and intensity of your workout and how long you exercise for each week a balanced diet is also paramount to a healthy lifestyle for the average adult ages 18 to 64 the US Department of Health and Human Services recommends either a minimum of two and a half hours per week of moderately intense exercise like brisk walking or biking or at least one hour and 15 minutes each week that combines moderate and high intensity workouts like running and swimming sprints on top of that make sure and take two days each week to strengthen your muscles with some weights or resistance training this will help your overall speed and endurance as you begin it's important to pace yourself and not push too hard too fast or you risk serious injury you'll discover that the fitter you become the easier it will be to exert a little more energy the next week the week after and so forth exercise smart and often and you'll be running marathons in no time you",

Baptist Health funded the study.\nThe participants in the study who already had cardiovascular disease \u2014 specifically coronary artery disease, stroke, heart attack, arrhythmias or peripheral artery disease \u2014 had higher healthcare costs overall compared to those who did not have these health issues. But those patients from this group who regularly exercised at recommended levels logged average healthcare costs at about $2,500 lower than those who didn\u2019t meet exercise guidelines.\nTo improve overall cardiovascular health, the American Heart Association recommends at least 150 minutes per week of moderate exercise, or 75 minutes per week of vigorous exercise, or a combination of moderate and vigorous activity.\nBenefits Extend Beyond the Financial Of course, the benefits of exercising regularly for those individuals with heart disease, or at least one risk factor, extend beyond the financial rewards.\n\u201cEven among an established high-risk group such as those diagnosed with heart disease or stroke, those who engaged in regular exercise activities reported a much lower risk of being hospitalized, (having) an emergency room visit and use of prescription medications,\u201d says Dr. Nasir. \u201cThe message to the patient is clear: There is no better pill in reducing the risk of disease and healthcare costs than optimizing physical activity.\u201d\nEven those participants with no heart disease who exercised regularly \u2014 but had at most one cardiovascular risk factor \u2014 had yearly medical costs averaging about $500 lower than those who didn\u2019t exercise.\nThe new study looked at data from a 2012 national survey sample of more than 26,000 Americans age 18 or older. People who were underweight, pregnant, or unable to walk up to 10 steps were excluded. Nearly half the participants who did not have cardiovascular disease, and almost one-third who did, reported meeting exercise guidelines for weekly moderate-to-vigorous activity.\nStudy Participants Were Asked This Question Individuals in the study were classified as physically active based on their answers to the question: \u201cDo you currently spend half hour or more in moderate to vigorous physical activity, at least five times a week?\u201d\nThe study used the widely accepted definitions for moderate and vigorous physical activity: Moderate physical activity causes \u201conly light sweating or a slight or moderate increase in breathing or heart rate and would include activities such as fast walking, raking leaves, mowing the lawn, or heavy cleaning.\u201d Vigorous physical activity causes \u201cheavy sweating or large increases in breathing or heart rate and would include activities such as running, race walking, lap swimming, aerobic classes, or fast bicycling.\u201d\nThe healthcare expenditures considered by researchers included out-of\u2010pocket spending related to hospitalizations, prescribed medications, outpatient visits (hospital outpatient visits and office-based visits), emergency department (ED) visits, and other expenditures (including dental visits, vision aid, home health care, and other medical supplies). Among those with cardiovascular disease, the highest expenditures pertained to hospitalizations, followed by prescription medications and outpatient visits.\n\u201cThese robust estimates for potential healthcare savings strongly support the AHA\u2019s (American Heart Association\u2019s) strategic goals for optimizing physical activity levels as a mean to favorably impact the increasing burden of cardiovascular disease and associated costs,\u201d the study concluded.\nDecember 10, 2025\n5 min. read\nDecember 10, 2025\n17:09\nDecember 8, 2025\n4 min. read\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

But those patients from this group who regularly exercised at recommended levels logged average healthcare costs at about $2,500 lower than those who didn\u2019t meet exercise guidelines.\nTo improve overall cardiovascular health, the American Heart Association recommends at least 150 minutes per week of moderate exercise, or 75 minutes per week of vigorous exercise, or a combination of moderate and vigorous activity.\nBenefits Extend Beyond the Financial Of course, the benefits of exercising regularly for those individuals with heart disease, or at least one risk factor, extend beyond the financial rewards.\n\u201cEven among an established high-risk group such as those diagnosed with heart disease or stroke, those who engaged in regular exercise activities reported a much lower risk of being hospitalized, (having) an emergency room visit and use of prescription medications,\u201d says Dr. Nasir. \u201cThe message to the patient is clear: There is no better pill in reducing the risk of disease and healthcare costs than optimizing physical activity.\u201d\nEven those participants with no heart disease who exercised regularly \u2014 but had at most one cardiovascular risk factor \u2014 had yearly medical costs averaging about $500 lower than those who didn\u2019t exercise.\nThe new study looked at data from a 2012 national survey sample of more than 26,000 Americans age 18 or older. People who were underweight, pregnant, or unable to walk up to 10 steps were excluded. Nearly half the participants who did not have cardiovascular disease, and almost one-third who did, reported meeting exercise guidelines for weekly moderate-to-vigorous activity.\nStudy Participants Were Asked This Question Individuals in the study were classified as physically active based on their answers to the question: \u201cDo you currently spend half hour or more in moderate to vigorous physical activity, at least five times a week?\u201d\nThe study used the widely accepted definitions for moderate and vigorous physical activity: Moderate physical activity causes \u201conly light sweating or a slight or moderate increase in breathing or heart rate and would include activities such as fast walking, raking leaves, mowing the lawn, or heavy cleaning.\u201d Vigorous physical activity causes \u201cheavy sweating or large increases in breathing or heart rate and would include activities such as running, race walking, lap swimming, aerobic classes, or fast bicycling.\u201d\nThe healthcare expenditures considered by researchers included out-of\u2010pocket spending related to hospitalizations, prescribed medications, outpatient visits (hospital outpatient visits and office-based visits), emergency department (ED) visits, and other expenditures (including dental visits, vision aid, home health care, and other medical supplies). Among those with cardiovascular disease, the highest expenditures pertained to hospitalizations, followed by prescription medications and outpatient visits.\n\u201cThese robust estimates for potential healthcare savings strongly support the AHA\u2019s (American Heart Association\u2019s) strategic goals for optimizing physical activity levels as a mean to favorably impact the increasing burden of cardiovascular disease and associated costs,\u201d the study concluded.\nDecember 10, 2025\n5 min. read\nDecember 10, 2025\n17:09\nDecember 8, 2025\n4 min. read\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Therefore, strategies that maintain or increase mitochondrial function will likely be of benefit in a number of clinical settings. Endurance exercise has long been known to increase mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle. Comparatively little is known regarding the impact of resistance exercise training on skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiratory function.\nThe purpose of the current study was to determine the impact of chronic resistance training on skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiratory capacity and function.\nHere, we studied the impact of a 12-week resistance exercise training program on skeletal muscle mitochondrial function in eleven young healthy men. Muscle biopsies were collected before and after the 12-week training program and mitochondrial respiratory capacity determined in permeabilized myofibers by high-resolution respirometry.\nResistance exercise training increased lean body mass and quadriceps muscle strength by 4 and 15%, respectively (P<0.001). Coupled mitochondria respiration supported by complex I, and complex I and II substrates, increased by 2- and 1.4-fold, respectively (P<0.01). The ratio of coupled complex I supported respiration to maximal respiration increased with resistance exercise training (P<0.05), as did complex I protein abundance (P<0.05), while the substrate control ratio for succinate was reduced after resistance exercise training (P<0.001). Transcripts responsible for proteins critical to electron transfer and NAD+ production increased with training (P<0.05), while transcripts involved in mitochondrial biogenesis were unaltered.\nCollectively, 12-weeks of resistance exercise training resulted in qualitative and quantitative changes in skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration. This adaptation occurs with modest changes in mitochondrial proteins and transcript expression. Resistance exercise training appears to be a means to augment the respiratory capacity and intrinsic function of skeletal muscle mitochondria.\nKeywords: Resistance training, skeletal muscle, mitochondria, bioenergetic\nMitochondria are the cellular organelles responsible for aerobic ATP production; thus mitochondrial \u201chealth\u201d is of importance to overall cellular function. The abundance and functional characteristics of mitochondrion within an organ influences its physiological function (17, 23, 24, 27). For example, aging is synonymous with reduced skeletal muscle mitochondrial density and function (29), which is associated with reduced exercise capacity. Conversely, the number and functionality of skeletal muscle mitochondria positively correlate with exercise capacity in healthy humans (15, 25, 38). Further, aerobic exercise is known to be a potent regulator of skeletal muscle oxidative capacity (12, 36), where mitochondrial density and function are elevated in both animals and humans acclimated to endurance exercise (13, 15, 25).\nResistance exercise has emerged as an efficacious intervention which augments muscle mass and function, particularly in populations with diminished lean body mass. However, the impact of resistance exercise on skeletal muscle bioenergetics remains poorly understood. Early reports suggested that skeletal muscle mitochondrial volume (22) and oxidative capacity (5) were reduced by chronic resistance exercise training. More recently, others have shown that resistance exercise increases the activity of oxidative enzymes in tissue homogenates (33) and respiration in skinned muscle fibers (25). However, many other studies have also shown that mitochondrial density (21) and the activity of oxidative enzymes thought to reflect mitochondrial abundance and/or function, such as citrate synthase, \u03b2-hydroxyl-acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase, are largely unaltered by chronic resistance exercise training (1, 10, 11, 26, 34, 35, 37). The discordance in these results are likely attributable to numerous factors, such as the training regime used, participants pre-existing training status, the timing of biopsy collection after exercise (19), and the numerous analytical techniques used to quantify the abundance and activity of mitochondrial enzymes (18).\nThe majority of studies to date concerning the impact of resistance exercise training on skeletal muscle bioenergetics have determined surrogate measures of oxidative capacity (5, 10, 11, 22, 26, 34, 35, 37), which are more likely to reflect the abundance of mitochondrial proteins rather than mitochondrial function. Surprisingly, only a small number of studies have attempted to determine the impact of resistance exercise training on skeletal muscle mitochondrial function. Salvadego and colleagues measured skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration in a cross-section of resistance trained athletes and untrained controls (28). These researchersfound that coupled (ATP producing) mitochondrial respiration per mg of muscle was greater in resistance trained athletes, as was the respiratory control ratio for ADP (28), suggesting that mitochondrial ATP production is more efficient in resistance trained individuals.\nRecently, Pesta and colleagues showed that endurance training and strength training performed under hypoxia, resulted in similar qualitative and quantitative changes in skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration (25). Unfortunately, while Pesta and co-workers attempted to study the impact of strength training under normoxic conditions, only 3 participants completed the intervention (25), meaning statistical power was not achieved. As such, a significant knowledge-gap remains concerning the impact of resistance exercise training on skeletal muscle respiratory capacity and function. To address this, we set out to determine the impact of chronic resistance exercise on skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiratory function. To do this, skeletal muscle biopsies were collected from youn\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Perhaps not as well understood is the importance of regular physical activity in building and maintaining healthy bones. Inactivity causes loss of bone!\nAging, along with certain diseases and medications, can cause bones to become very weak and fragile over time \u2014 a condition called osteoporosis. It often occurs in women after menopause, and in men in older age. This bone-thinning disease puts people at greater risk for broken bones, which can seriously limit mobility and independence.\nWe also tend to lose muscle as we age \u2014 a condition called sarcopenia. People who develop osteoporosis or sarcopenia are considered frail: more likely to fall and more likely to break a bone.\nExercise works on bones much like it works on muscles \u2014 it makes them stronger. Exercise is important for building strong bones when we are younger, and it is essential for maintaining bone strength when we are older. Because bone is living tissue, it changes over time in response to the forces placed upon it. When you exercise regularly, your bone adapts by building more bone and becoming denser. This improvement in bone requires good nutrition, including adequate calcium and Vitamin D.\nAnother benefit of exercise is that it improves balance and coordination. This becomes especially important as we get older because it helps to prevent falls and the broken bones that may result.\nRegular physical activity helps build and maintain healthy bones.\nmonkeybusinessimages/iStock/Getty Images Plus\nThere are many different types of exercise and they all offer health benefits. The two types that are most effective for building strong bones are weight-bearing exercise and strength-training exercise. Exercises to improve bone strength are site-specific. For example, walking can improve bone strength in the legs and spine but not in the wrist.\nPostural stretching and strengthening can help prevent or decrease the amount of upper spine slumping seen in many older people. Leaning over to tie your shoes or sweeping and mopping can lead to spine fractures in people at high risk of spine fracture. Try to maintain good spine posture with all your activities.\nWeightbearing describes any activity you do on your feet that works your bones and muscles against gravity. When your feet and legs carry your body weight, more stress is placed on your bones, making your bones work harder. Weightbearing exercise after young adulthood can help prevent further bone loss and strengthen bone.\nExamples of weightbearing exercise include:\nHigher impact activities, such as jogging and jumping rope, increase the weight on bones and provide more bone-strengthening benefits. However, people who are frail or who have already been diagnosed with thinning bone should talk to their doctors about the types of physical activity that would be best for them.\nJogging and other weightbearing exercises force you to work against gravity.\nm-imagephotography/iStock/Getty Images Plus\nDuring strength-training activities, resistance is added to movement in order to make muscles work harder and, over time, become stronger. Although resistance exercises focus on increasing muscle mass, they also put stress on bones and have bone-building capacity.\nCommon types of strength training include weight machines, free weights, and exercises (such as push-ups) that use your own body weight. Elastic bands can also be used to add resistance to exercises.\nA general guideline for strength training is to exercise each major muscle group at least twice a week.

If you have a musculoskeletal health condition, such as arthritis, that prevents you from doing weightbearing activities, these are good alternatives.\nRelated Articles\nBone Health Basics\nExercise Walking\nCalcium, Nutrition, and Bone Health\nAn effective exercise program for bone health includes 30 minutes of weightbearing activity, four or more days a week.

Therefore, strategies that maintain or increase mitochondrial function will likely be of benefit in a number of clinical settings. Endurance exercise has long been known to increase mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle. Comparatively little is known regarding the impact of resistance exercise training on skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiratory function.\nThe purpose of the current study was to determine the impact of chronic resistance training on skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiratory capacity and function.\nHere, we studied the impact of a 12-week resistance exercise training program on skeletal muscle mitochondrial function in eleven young healthy men. Muscle biopsies were collected before and after the 12-week training program and mitochondrial respiratory capacity determined in permeabilized myofibers by high-resolution respirometry.\nResistance exercise training increased lean body mass and quadriceps muscle strength by 4 and 15%, respectively (P<0.001). Coupled mitochondria respiration supported by complex I, and complex I and II substrates, increased by 2- and 1.4-fold, respectively (P<0.01). The ratio of coupled complex I supported respiration to maximal respiration increased with resistance exercise training (P<0.05), as did complex I protein abundance (P<0.05), while the substrate control ratio for succinate was reduced after resistance exercise training (P<0.001). Transcripts responsible for proteins critical to electron transfer and NAD+ production increased with training (P<0.05), while transcripts involved in mitochondrial biogenesis were unaltered.\nCollectively, 12-weeks of resistance exercise training resulted in qualitative and quantitative changes in skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration.

Resistance exercise training appears to be a means to augment the respiratory capacity and intrinsic function of skeletal muscle mitochondria.\nKeywords: Resistance training, skeletal muscle, mitochondria, bioenergetic\nMitochondria are the cellular organelles responsible for aerobic ATP production; thus mitochondrial \u201chealth\u201d is of importance to overall cellular function. The abundance and functional characteristics of mitochondrion within an organ influences its physiological function (17, 23, 24, 27). For example, aging is synonymous with reduced skeletal muscle mitochondrial density and function (29), which is associated with reduced exercise capacity. Conversely, the number and functionality of skeletal muscle mitochondria positively correlate with exercise capacity in healthy humans (15, 25, 38). Further, aerobic exercise is known to be a potent regulator of skeletal muscle oxidative capacity (12, 36), where mitochondrial density and function are elevated in both animals and humans acclimated to endurance exercise (13, 15, 25).\nResistance exercise has emerged as an efficacious intervention which augments muscle mass and function, particularly in populations with diminished lean body mass. However, the impact of resistance exercise on skeletal muscle bioenergetics remains poorly understood. Early reports suggested that skeletal muscle mitochondrial volume (22) and oxidative capacity (5) were reduced by chronic resistance exercise training. More recently, others have shown that resistance exercise increases the activity of oxidative enzymes in tissue homogenates (33) and respiration in skinned muscle fibers (25). However, many other studies have also shown that mitochondrial density (21) and the activity of oxidative enzymes thought to reflect mitochondrial abundance and/or function, such as citrate synthase, \u03b2-hydroxyl-acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase, are largely unaltered by chronic resistance exercise training (1, 10, 11, 26, 34, 35, 37). The discordance in these results are likely attributable to numerous factors, such as the training regime used, participants pre-existing training status, the timing of biopsy collection after exercise (19), and the numerous analytical techniques used to quantify the abundance and activity of mitochondrial enzymes (18).\nThe majority of studies to date concerning the impact of resistance exercise training on skeletal muscle bioenergetics have determined surrogate measures of oxidative capacity (5, 10, 11, 22, 26, 34, 35, 37), which are more likely to reflect the abundance of mitochondrial proteins rather than mitochondrial function. Surprisingly, only a small number of studies have attempted to determine the impact of resistance exercise training on skeletal muscle mitochondrial function. Salvadego and colleagues measured skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration in a cross-section of resistance trained athletes and untrained controls (28). These researchersfound that coupled (ATP producing) mitochondrial respiration per mg of muscle was greater in resistance trained athletes, as was the respiratory control ratio for ADP (28), suggesting that mitochondrial ATP production is more efficient in resistance trained individuals.\nRecently, Pesta and colleagues showed that endurance training and strength training performed under hypoxia, resulted in similar qualitative and quantitative changes in skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration (25). Unfortunately, while Pesta and co-workers attempted to study the impact of strength training under normoxic conditions, only 3 participants completed the intervention (25), meaning statistical power was not achieved.

A new study by researchers at UT Southwestern shows that when older adults with mild memory loss followed an exercise program for a year, the blood flow to their brains increased. The results were published online today in the Journal of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease.\n\u201cThis is part of a growing body of evidence linking exercise with brain health,\u201d says study leader Rong Zhang, Ph.D., professor of neurology at UTSW. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown for the first time in a randomized trial in these older adults that exercise gets more blood flowing to your brain.\u201d\nAs many as one-fifth of people age 65 and older have some level of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) \u2013 slight changes to the brain that affect memory, decision-making, or reasoning skills. In many cases, MCI progresses to dementia, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nScientists have previously shown that lower-than-usual levels of blood flow to the brain, and stiffer blood vessels leading to the brain, are associated with MCI and dementia. Studies have also suggested that regular aerobic exercise may help improve cognition and memory in healthy older adults. However, scientists have not established whether there is a direct link between exercise, stiffer blood vessels, and brain blood flow.\n\u201cThere is still a lot we don\u2019t know about the effects of exercise on cognitive decline later in life,\u201d says C. Munro Cullum, Ph.D., professor of psychiatry at UTSW and co-senior author of the study. \u201cMCI and dementia are likely to be influenced by a complex interplay of many factors, and we think that, at least for some people, exercise is one of those factors.\u201d\nIn the study, Zhang, Cullum, and their colleagues followed 70 men and women aged 55 to 80 who had been diagnosed with MCI. Participants underwent cognitive exams, fitness tests, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Then they were randomly assigned to either follow a moderate aerobic exercise program or a stretching program for one year. The exercise program involved three to five exercise sessions a week, each with 30-40 minutes of moderate exercise such as a brisk walk.\nIn both programs, exercise physiologists supervised participants for the first four to six weeks, then had the patients record their exercises and wear a heart rate monitor during exercise.\nForty-eight study participants \u2013 29 in the stretching group and 19 in the aerobic exercise group \u2013 completed the full year of training and returned for follow-up tests. Among them, those who performed aerobic exercise showed decreased stiffness of blood vessels in their neck and increased overall blood flow to the brain. The more their oxygen consumption (one marker of aerobic fitness) increased, the greater the changes to the blood vessel stiffness and brain blood flow. Changes in these measurements were not found among people who followed the stretching program.\nWhile the study didn\u2019t find any significant changes in memory or other cognitive function, the researchers say that may be because of the small size or short length of the trial. Changes to blood flow could precede changes to cognition, they say.

Comparatively little is known regarding the impact of resistance ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nLoss of mitochondrial competency is associated with several chronic illnesses. Therefore, strategies that maintain or increase mitochondrial function will likely be of benefit in a number of clinical settings. Endurance exercise has long been known to increase mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle. Comparatively little is known regarding the impact of resistance exercise training on skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiratory function.\nThe purpose of the current study was to determine the impact of chronic resistance training on skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiratory capacity and function.\nHere, we studied the impact of a 12-week resistance exercise training program on skeletal muscle mitochondrial function in eleven young healthy men. Muscle biopsies were collected before and after the 12-week training program and mitochondrial respiratory capacity determined in permeabilized myofibers by high-resolution respirometry.\nResistance exercise training increased lean body mass and quadriceps muscle strength by 4 and 15%, respectively (P<0.001). Coupled mitochondria respiration supported by complex I, and complex I and II substrates, increased by 2- and 1.4-fold, respectively (P<0.01). The ratio of coupled complex I supported respiration to maximal respiration increased with resistance exercise training (P<0.05), as did complex I protein abundance (P<0.05), while the substrate control ratio for succinate was reduced after resistance exercise training (P<0.001). Transcripts responsible for proteins critical to electron transfer and NAD+ production increased with training (P<0.05), while transcripts involved in mitochondrial biogenesis were unaltered.\nCollectively, 12-weeks of resistance exercise training resulted in qualitative and quantitative changes in skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration. This adaptation occurs with modest changes in mitochondrial proteins and transcript expression. Resistance exercise training appears to be a means to augment the respiratory capacity and intrinsic function of skeletal muscle mitochondria.\nKeywords: Resistance training, skeletal muscle, mitochondria, bioenergetic\nMitochondria are the cellular organelles responsible for aerobic ATP production; thus mitochondrial \u201chealth\u201d is of importance to overall cellular function. The abundance and functional characteristics of mitochondrion within an organ influences its physiological function (17, 23, 24, 27). For example, aging is synonymous with reduced skeletal muscle mitochondrial density and function (29), which is associated with reduced exercise capacity. Conversely, the number and functionality of skeletal muscle mitochondria positively correlate with exercise capacity in healthy humans (15, 25, 38). Further, aerobic exercise is known to be a potent regulator of skeletal muscle oxidative capacity (12, 36), where mitochondrial density and function are elevated in both animals and humans acclimated to endurance exercise (13, 15, 25).\nResistance exercise has emerged as an efficacious intervention which augments muscle mass and function, particularly in populations with diminished lean body mass. However, the impact of resistance exercise on skeletal muscle bioenergetics remains poorly understood. Early reports suggested that skeletal muscle mitochondrial volume (22) and oxidative capacity (5) were reduced by chronic resistance exercise training. More recently, others have shown that resistance exercise increases the activity of oxidative enzymes in tissue homogenates (33) and respiration in skinned muscle fibers (25). However, many other studies have also shown that mitochondrial density (21) and the activity of oxidative enzymes thought to reflect mitochondrial abundance and/or function, such as citrate synthase, \u03b2-hydroxyl-acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase, are largely unaltered by chronic resistance exercise training (1, 10, 11, 26, 34, 35, 37). The discordance in these results are likely attributable to numerous factors, such as the training regime used, participants pre-existing training status, the timing of biopsy collection after exercise (19), and the numerous analytical techniques used to quantify the abundance and activity of mitochondrial enzymes (18).\nThe majority of studies to date concerning the impact of resistance exercise training on skeletal muscle bioenergetics have determined surrogate measures of oxidative capacity (5, 10, 11, 22, 26, 34, 35, 37), which are more likely to reflect the abundance of mitochondrial proteins rather than mitochondrial function. Surprisingly, only a small number of studies have attempted to determine the impact of resistance exercise training on skeletal muscle mitochondrial function. Salvadego and colleagues measured skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration in a cross-section of resistance trained athletes and untrained controls (28). These researchersfound that coupled (ATP producing) mitochondrial respiration per mg of muscle was greater in resistance trained athletes, as was the respiratory control ratio for ADP (28), suggesting that mitochondrial ATP production is more efficient in resistance trained individuals.\nRecently, Pesta and colleagues showed that endurance training and strength training performed under hypoxia, resulted in similar qualitative and quantitative changes in skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration (25). Unfortunately, while Pesta and co-workers attempted to study the impact of strength training under normoxic conditions, only 3 participants completed the intervention (25), meaning statistical power was not achieved. As such, a significant knowledge-gap remains concerning the impact of resistance exercise training on skeletal muscle respiratory capacity and function. To address this, we set out to determine the impact of chronic resistance exercise on skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiratory function. To do this, skeletal muscle biopsies were collected from youn\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The soreness increases to a peak between 24 and 72 hours then subsides by 7 days.\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nPost-exercise muscle soreness is a dull, aching sensation that follows unaccustomed muscular exertion. Primarily on the basis of previous laboratory-based research on eccentric exercise, soreness is usually said to follow an inverted U-shaped curve over time, peaking 24 \u2013 48 hours after exercise. As such, it is often described as \"delayed-onset\" muscle soreness. In a study of long-distance runners, soreness seemed to peak immediately and then reduce gradually over time. The study is a secondary analysis of clinical trial data that aims to determine whether the time course of soreness following a natural exercise, long-distance running, is different from that following a laboratory-based exercise, bench-stepping.\nThis is a reanalysis of data from three previous clinical trials. The trials included 400 runners taking part in long-distance races and 82 untrained volunteers performing a bench-stepping test. Subjects completed a Likert scale of muscle soreness every morning and evening for the five days following their exercise.\nInteraction between trial and time is highly significant, suggesting a different time course of soreness following running and bench-stepping. 45% of subjects in the bench-stepping trial experienced peak soreness at the third or fourth follow-up (approximately 36 \u2013 48 hours after exercise) compared to only 14% of those in the running trial. The difference between groups is robust to multivariate analysis incorporating possible confounding variables.\nSoreness in runners following long-distance running follows a different time course to that in untrained individuals undertaking bench-stepping. Research on exercise taking place in the laboratory context does not necessarily generalize to exercise undertaken by trained athletes when engaged in their chosen sport.\nPost-exercise muscle soreness \u2013 a dull, aching sensation following unaccustomed muscular exertion \u2013 is usually said to follow an inverted U-shaped curve over time. Typical statements found in the literature are that soreness: \"develops\" 24 to 48 hours after exercise [1] ; \"is usually perceived approximately 24 hours after the exercise bout [and] may linger for an additional 24 to 48 hours\" [2] and \"peaks 24\u201348 hours after exercise\" [3].\nThese claims are well supported by data from studies which have measured soreness at various times following an exercise bout. For example. High et al. [4] assessed soreness at 24 and 48 hours after eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors. Soreness scores were higher at the 48 hour follow-up. Similarly, Byrnes et al. [5] reported that muscle soreness steadily increased when measured 6, 18 and 42 hours following 30 minutes of downhill treadmill running. Soreness has also been found to be higher at 48 hours than at 24 hours in untreated controls undertaking bench-stepping [2] and to peak at 48 hours in three separate studies of eccentric exercise of the elbow flexors [6-8]. In our own studies of soreness following bench-stepping, soreness scores peaked at 48 hours [9] (see figure 1). Perhaps the only study inconsistent with these findings was that of Donelly et al, who found that soreness induced by downhill running on a treadmill was slightly higher at 24 than at 48 hours [3]. That said, a classic inverted U-shaped curve was reported, with soreness low immediately following exercise, highest at 24 and 48 hours and falling again at 72 hours. Such findings are so prevalent that post-exercise muscle soreness is generally described in the literature as \"delayed-onset\" muscle soreness.\nTime course of muscle soreness following long-distance running and benchstepping\nThe studies above involved exercise undertaken in a laboratory setting. With rare exceptions [10], post-exercise soreness has not been investigated in athletes undertaking their chosen sport. Whilst conducting data analysis on a study of long distance running, we noticed that soreness seemed to peak immediately and then reduce gradually over time (see figure 1). This was a similar time course to two previous studies in long-distance runners for which we had obtained original data [11,12]. We therefore decided to examine the hypothesis that the time course of post-exercise soreness is different for long-distance running than for bench-stepping by examining data from three clinical trials we had completed. If the time course of soreness resulting from an \"artificial\" laboratory based exercise (bench-stepping) is different from that resulting from a sport (long-distance running) it is plausible that these two methods of soreness induction have different physiological consequences.\nWe compared data from a study in which soreness was induced by a bench-stepping regime with those from a trial in which soreness resulted from long-distance running. In the bench-stepping trial, healthy volunteers undertook a 10 minute period of bench-stepping while carrying a backpack containing sandbags equivalent to 10% of their body weight. This is a previously validated method of soreness induction [2]. Only untrained individuals were eligible. Subjects were excluded if they regularly participated in vigorous exercise in the previous six months. \"Vigorous exercise\" was defined as playing a sport or undertaking an activity designed to increase physical fitness; \"regular participation\" was defined as undertaking the activity three or more times a week for more than three consecutive weeks and for more than 15 minutes at a time. We included data from 82 subjects in two trials in which the eligibility criteria and method of soreness induction were identical [9]. The running trial studied 400 runners expecting soreness after a long-distance run [13]. Subjects took part in a number of different runs. Mean race length was 21.4 miles SD (7.79).

How to decrease delayed onset muscle soreness\n\nGoogle Search Snippet:\nRecent clinical results show that using kinesiology tape before, during, and after your workout can help reduce post-workout muscle soreness by 50% for days.\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nPost-exercise muscle soreness is a dull, aching sensation that follows unaccustomed muscular exertion. Primarily on the basis of previous laboratory-based research on eccentric exercise, soreness is usually said to follow an inverted U-shaped curve over time, peaking 24 \u2013 48 hours after exercise. As such, it is often described as \"delayed-onset\" muscle soreness. In a study of long-distance runners, soreness seemed to peak immediately and then reduce gradually over time. The study is a secondary analysis of clinical trial data that aims to determine whether the time course of soreness following a natural exercise, long-distance running, is different from that following a laboratory-based exercise, bench-stepping.\nThis is a reanalysis of data from three previous clinical trials. The trials included 400 runners taking part in long-distance races and 82 untrained volunteers performing a bench-stepping test. Subjects completed a Likert scale of muscle soreness every morning and evening for the five days following their exercise.\nInteraction between trial and time is highly significant, suggesting a different time course of soreness following running and bench-stepping. 45% of subjects in the bench-stepping trial experienced peak soreness at the third or fourth follow-up (approximately 36 \u2013 48 hours after exercise) compared to only 14% of those in the running trial. The difference between groups is robust to multivariate analysis incorporating possible confounding variables.\nSoreness in runners following long-distance running follows a different time course to that in untrained individuals undertaking bench-stepping. Research on exercise taking place in the laboratory context does not necessarily generalize to exercise undertaken by trained athletes when engaged in their chosen sport.\nPost-exercise muscle soreness \u2013 a dull, aching sensation following unaccustomed muscular exertion \u2013 is usually said to follow an inverted U-shaped curve over time. Typical statements found in the literature are that soreness: \"develops\" 24 to 48 hours after exercise [1] ; \"is usually perceived approximately 24 hours after the exercise bout [and] may linger for an additional 24 to 48 hours\" [2] and \"peaks 24\u201348 hours after exercise\" [3].\nThese claims are well supported by data from studies which have measured soreness at various times following an exercise bout. For example. High et al. [4] assessed soreness at 24 and 48 hours after eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors. Soreness scores were higher at the 48 hour follow-up. Similarly, Byrnes et al. [5] reported that muscle soreness steadily increased when measured 6, 18 and 42 hours following 30 minutes of downhill treadmill running. Soreness has also been found to be higher at 48 hours than at 24 hours in untreated controls undertaking bench-stepping [2] and to peak at 48 hours in three separate studies of eccentric exercise of the elbow flexors [6-8]. In our own studies of soreness following bench-stepping, soreness scores peaked at 48 hours [9] (see figure 1). Perhaps the only study inconsistent with these findings was that of Donelly et al, who found that soreness induced by downhill running on a treadmill was slightly higher at 24 than at 48 hours [3]. That said, a classic inverted U-shaped curve was reported, with soreness low immediately following exercise, highest at 24 and 48 hours and falling again at 72 hours. Such findings are so prevalent that post-exercise muscle soreness is generally described in the literature as \"delayed-onset\" muscle soreness.\nTime course of muscle soreness following long-distance running and benchstepping\nThe studies above involved exercise undertaken in a laboratory setting. With rare exceptions [10], post-exercise soreness has not been investigated in athletes undertaking their chosen sport. Whilst conducting data analysis on a study of long distance running, we noticed that soreness seemed to peak immediately and then reduce gradually over time (see figure 1). This was a similar time course to two previous studies in long-distance runners for which we had obtained original data [11,12]. We therefore decided to examine the hypothesis that the time course of post-exercise soreness is different for long-distance running than for bench-stepping by examining data from three clinical trials we had completed. If the time course of soreness resulting from an \"artificial\" laboratory based exercise (bench-stepping) is different from that resulting from a sport (long-distance running) it is plausible that these two methods of soreness induction have different physiological consequences.\nWe compared data from a study in which soreness was induced by a bench-stepping regime with those from a trial in which soreness resulted from long-distance running. In the bench-stepping trial, healthy volunteers undertook a 10 minute period of bench-stepping while carrying a backpack containing sandbags equivalent to 10% of their body weight. This is a previously validated method of soreness induction [2]. Only untrained individuals were eligible. Subjects were excluded if they regularly participated in vigorous exercise in the previous six months. \"Vigorous exercise\" was defined as playing a sport or undertaking an activity designed to increase physical fitness; \"regular participation\" was defined as undertaking the activity three or more times a week for more than three consecutive weeks and for more than 15 minutes at a time. We included data from 82 subjects in two trials in which the eligibility criteria and method of soreness induction were identical [9]. The running trial studied 400 runners expecting soreness after a long-distance run [13]. Subjects took part in a number of different runs. Mean race length was 21.4 miles SD (7.79). The shortest race was just under 2 miles (one subject) and the longest 50 miles (one subject) but 95% of the races were between 6.2 and 26.2 miles. Approximat\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Perhaps not as well understood is the importance of regular physical activity in building and maintaining healthy bones. Inactivity causes loss of bone!\nAging, along with certain diseases and medications, can cause bones to become very weak and fragile over time \u2014 a condition called osteoporosis. It often occurs in women after menopause, and in men in older age. This bone-thinning disease puts people at greater risk for broken bones, which can seriously limit mobility and independence.\nWe also tend to lose muscle as we age \u2014 a condition called sarcopenia. People who develop osteoporosis or sarcopenia are considered frail: more likely to fall and more likely to break a bone.\nExercise works on bones much like it works on muscles \u2014 it makes them stronger. Exercise is important for building strong bones when we are younger, and it is essential for maintaining bone strength when we are older. Because bone is living tissue, it changes over time in response to the forces placed upon it. When you exercise regularly, your bone adapts by building more bone and becoming denser. This improvement in bone requires good nutrition, including adequate calcium and Vitamin D.\nAnother benefit of exercise is that it improves balance and coordination. This becomes especially important as we get older because it helps to prevent falls and the broken bones that may result.\nRegular physical activity helps build and maintain healthy bones.\nmonkeybusinessimages/iStock/Getty Images Plus\nThere are many different types of exercise and they all offer health benefits. The two types that are most effective for building strong bones are weight-bearing exercise and strength-training exercise. Exercises to improve bone strength are site-specific. For example, walking can improve bone strength in the legs and spine but not in the wrist.\nPostural stretching and strengthening can help prevent or decrease the amount of upper spine slumping seen in many older people. Leaning over to tie your shoes or sweeping and mopping can lead to spine fractures in people at high risk of spine fracture.

Weightbearing exercise after young adulthood can help prevent further bone loss and strengthen bone.\nExamples of weightbearing exercise include:\nHigher impact activities, such as jogging and jumping rope, increase the weight on bones and provide more bone-strengthening benefits.

Although resistance exercises focus on increasing muscle mass, they also put stress on bones and have bone-building capacity.\nCommon types of strength training include weight machines, free weights, and exercises (such as push-ups) that use your own body weight. Elastic bands can also be used to add resistance to exercises.\nA general guideline for strength training is to exercise each major muscle group at least twice a week.

Therefore, strategies that maintain or increase mitochondrial function will likely be of benefit in a number of clinical settings. Endurance exercise has long been known to increase mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle. Comparatively little is known regarding the impact of resistance exercise training on skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiratory function.\nThe purpose of the current study was to determine the impact of chronic resistance training on skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiratory capacity and function.\nHere, we studied the impact of a 12-week resistance exercise training program on skeletal muscle mitochondrial function in eleven young healthy men. Muscle biopsies were collected before and after the 12-week training program and mitochondrial respiratory capacity determined in permeabilized myofibers by high-resolution respirometry.\nResistance exercise training increased lean body mass and quadriceps muscle strength by 4 and 15%, respectively (P<0.001). Coupled mitochondria respiration supported by complex I, and complex I and II substrates, increased by 2- and 1.4-fold, respectively (P<0.01). The ratio of coupled complex I supported respiration to maximal respiration increased with resistance exercise training (P<0.05), as did complex I protein abundance (P<0.05), while the substrate control ratio for succinate was reduced after resistance exercise training (P<0.001). Transcripts responsible for proteins critical to electron transfer and NAD+ production increased with training (P<0.05), while transcripts involved in mitochondrial biogenesis were unaltered.\nCollectively, 12-weeks of resistance exercise training resulted in qualitative and quantitative changes in skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration. This adaptation occurs with modest changes in mitochondrial proteins and transcript expression. Resistance exercise training appears to be a means to augment the respiratory capacity and intrinsic function of skeletal muscle mitochondria.\nKeywords: Resistance training, skeletal muscle, mitochondria, bioenergetic\nMitochondria are the cellular organelles responsible for aerobic ATP production; thus mitochondrial \u201chealth\u201d is of importance to overall cellular function. The abundance and functional characteristics of mitochondrion within an organ influences its physiological function (17, 23, 24, 27). For example, aging is synonymous with reduced skeletal muscle mitochondrial density and function (29), which is associated with reduced exercise capacity. Conversely, the number and functionality of skeletal muscle mitochondria positively correlate with exercise capacity in healthy humans (15, 25, 38). Further, aerobic exercise is known to be a potent regulator of skeletal muscle oxidative capacity (12, 36), where mitochondrial density and function are elevated in both animals and humans acclimated to endurance exercise (13, 15, 25).\nResistance exercise has emerged as an efficacious intervention which augments muscle mass and function, particularly in populations with diminished lean body mass. However, the impact of resistance exercise on skeletal muscle bioenergetics remains poorly understood. Early reports suggested that skeletal muscle mitochondrial volume (22) and oxidative capacity (5) were reduced by chronic resistance exercise training. More recently, others have shown that resistance exercise increases the activity of oxidative enzymes in tissue homogenates (33) and respiration in skinned muscle fibers (25). However, many other studies have also shown that mitochondrial density (21) and the activity of oxidative enzymes thought to reflect mitochondrial abundance and/or function, such as citrate synthase, \u03b2-hydroxyl-acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase, are largely unaltered by chronic resistance exercise training (1, 10, 11, 26, 34, 35, 37). The discordance in these results are likely attributable to numerous factors, such as the training regime used, participants pre-existing training status, the timing of biopsy collection after exercise (19), and the numerous analytical techniques used to quantify the abundance and activity of mitochondrial enzymes (18).\nThe majority of studies to date concerning the impact of resistance exercise training on skeletal muscle bioenergetics have determined surrogate measures of oxidative capacity (5, 10, 11, 22, 26, 34, 35, 37), which are more likely to reflect the abundance of mitochondrial proteins rather than mitochondrial function. Surprisingly, only a small number of studies have attempted to determine the impact of resistance exercise training on skeletal muscle mitochondrial function. Salvadego and colleagues measured skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration in a cross-section of resistance trained athletes and untrained controls (28). These researchersfound that coupled (ATP producing) mitochondrial respiration per mg of muscle was greater in resistance trained athletes, as was the respiratory control ratio for ADP (28), suggesting that mitochondrial ATP production is more efficient in resistance trained individuals.\nRecently, Pesta and colleagues showed that endurance training and strength training performed under hypoxia, resulted in similar qualitative and quantitative changes in skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration (25). Unfortunately, while Pesta and co-workers attempted to study the impact of strength training under normoxic conditions, only 3 participants completed the intervention (25), meaning statistical power was not achieved. As such, a significant knowledge-gap remains concerning the impact of resistance exercise training on skeletal muscle respiratory capacity and function. To address this, we set out to determine the impact of chronic resistance exercise on skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiratory function. To do this, skeletal muscle biopsies were collected from youn\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Primarily on the basis of previous laboratory-based research on eccentric exercise, soreness is usually said to follow an inverted U-shaped curve over time, peaking 24 \u2013 48 hours after exercise. As such, it is often described as \"delayed-onset\" muscle soreness. In a study of long-distance runners, soreness seemed to peak immediately and then reduce gradually over time. The study is a secondary analysis of clinical trial data that aims to determine whether the time course of soreness following a natural exercise, long-distance running, is different from that following a laboratory-based exercise, bench-stepping.\nThis is a reanalysis of data from three previous clinical trials. The trials included 400 runners taking part in long-distance races and 82 untrained volunteers performing a bench-stepping test. Subjects completed a Likert scale of muscle soreness every morning and evening for the five days following their exercise.\nInteraction between trial and time is highly significant, suggesting a different time course of soreness following running and bench-stepping. 45% of subjects in the bench-stepping trial experienced peak soreness at the third or fourth follow-up (approximately 36 \u2013 48 hours after exercise) compared to only 14% of those in the running trial. The difference between groups is robust to multivariate analysis incorporating possible confounding variables.\nSoreness in runners following long-distance running follows a different time course to that in untrained individuals undertaking bench-stepping. Research on exercise taking place in the laboratory context does not necessarily generalize to exercise undertaken by trained athletes when engaged in their chosen sport.\nPost-exercise muscle soreness \u2013 a dull, aching sensation following unaccustomed muscular exertion \u2013 is usually said to follow an inverted U-shaped curve over time. Typical statements found in the literature are that soreness: \"develops\" 24 to 48 hours after exercise [1] ; \"is usually perceived approximately 24 hours after the exercise bout [and] may linger for an additional 24 to 48 hours\" [2] and \"peaks 24\u201348 hours after exercise\" [3].\nThese claims are well supported by data from studies which have measured soreness at various times following an exercise bout. For example. High et al. [4] assessed soreness at 24 and 48 hours after eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors. Soreness scores were higher at the 48 hour follow-up. Similarly, Byrnes et al. [5] reported that muscle soreness steadily increased when measured 6, 18 and 42 hours following 30 minutes of downhill treadmill running. Soreness has also been found to be higher at 48 hours than at 24 hours in untreated controls undertaking bench-stepping [2] and to peak at 48 hours in three separate studies of eccentric exercise of the elbow flexors [6-8]. In our own studies of soreness following bench-stepping, soreness scores peaked at 48 hours [9] (see figure 1). Perhaps the only study inconsistent with these findings was that of Donelly et al, who found that soreness induced by downhill running on a treadmill was slightly higher at 24 than at 48 hours [3]. That said, a classic inverted U-shaped curve was reported, with soreness low immediately following exercise, highest at 24 and 48 hours and falling again at 72 hours. Such findings are so prevalent that post-exercise muscle soreness is generally described in the literature as \"delayed-onset\" muscle soreness.\nTime course of muscle soreness following long-distance running and benchstepping\nThe studies above involved exercise undertaken in a laboratory setting. With rare exceptions [10], post-exercise soreness has not been investigated in athletes undertaking their chosen sport. Whilst conducting data analysis on a study of long distance running, we noticed that soreness seemed to peak immediately and then reduce gradually over time (see figure 1). This was a similar time course to two previous studies in long-distance runners for which we had obtained original data [11,12]. We therefore decided to examine the hypothesis that the time course of post-exercise soreness is different for long-distance running than for bench-stepping by examining data from three clinical trials we had completed. If the time course of soreness resulting from an \"artificial\" laboratory based exercise (bench-stepping) is different from that resulting from a sport (long-distance running) it is plausible that these two methods of soreness induction have different physiological consequences.\nWe compared data from a study in which soreness was induced by a bench-stepping regime with those from a trial in which soreness resulted from long-distance running. In the bench-stepping trial, healthy volunteers undertook a 10 minute period of bench-stepping while carrying a backpack containing sandbags equivalent to 10% of their body weight. This is a previously validated method of soreness induction [2]. Only untrained individuals were eligible. Subjects were excluded if they regularly participated in vigorous exercise in the previous six months. \"Vigorous exercise\" was defined as playing a sport or undertaking an activity designed to increase physical fitness; \"regular participation\" was defined as undertaking the activity three or more times a week for more than three consecutive weeks and for more than 15 minutes at a time. We included data from 82 subjects in two trials in which the eligibility criteria and method of soreness induction were identical [9]. The running trial studied 400 runners expecting soreness after a long-distance run [13]. Subjects took part in a number of different runs. Mean race length was 21.4 miles SD (7.79). The shortest race was just under 2 miles (one subject) and the longest 50 miles (one subject) but 95% of the races were between 6.2 and 26.2 miles. Approximat\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

A new study by researchers at UT Southwestern shows that when older adults with mild memory loss followed an exercise program for a year, the blood flow to their brains increased. The results were published online today in the Journal of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease.\n\u201cThis is part of a growing body of evidence linking exercise with brain health,\u201d says study leader Rong Zhang, Ph.D., professor of neurology at UTSW. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown for the first time in a randomized trial in these older adults that exercise gets more blood flowing to your brain.\u201d\nAs many as one-fifth of people age 65 and older have some level of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) \u2013 slight changes to the brain that affect memory, decision-making, or reasoning skills. In many cases, MCI progresses to dementia, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nScientists have previously shown that lower-than-usual levels of blood flow to the brain, and stiffer blood vessels leading to the brain, are associated with MCI and dementia. Studies have also suggested that regular aerobic exercise may help improve cognition and memory in healthy older adults. However, scientists have not established whether there is a direct link between exercise, stiffer blood vessels, and brain blood flow.\n\u201cThere is still a lot we don\u2019t know about the effects of exercise on cognitive decline later in life,\u201d says C. Munro Cullum, Ph.D., professor of psychiatry at UTSW and co-senior author of the study. \u201cMCI and dementia are likely to be influenced by a complex interplay of many factors, and we think that, at least for some people, exercise is one of those factors.\u201d\nIn the study, Zhang, Cullum, and their colleagues followed 70 men and women aged 55 to 80 who had been diagnosed with MCI. Participants underwent cognitive exams, fitness tests, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Then they were randomly assigned to either follow a moderate aerobic exercise program or a stretching program for one year. The exercise program involved three to five exercise sessions a week, each with 30-40 minutes of moderate exercise such as a brisk walk.\nIn both programs, exercise physiologists supervised participants for the first four to six weeks, then had the patients record their exercises and wear a heart rate monitor during exercise.\nForty-eight study participants \u2013 29 in the stretching group and 19 in the aerobic exercise group \u2013 completed the full year of training and returned for follow-up tests. Among them, those who performed aerobic exercise showed decreased stiffness of blood vessels in their neck and increased overall blood flow to the brain. The more their oxygen consumption (one marker of aerobic fitness) increased, the greater the changes to the blood vessel stiffness and brain blood flow. Changes in these measurements were not found among people who followed the stretching program.\nWhile the study didn\u2019t find any significant changes in memory or other cognitive function, the researchers say that may be because of the small size or short length of the trial. Changes to blood flow could precede changes to cognition, they say. They\u2019re already carrying out a larger two-year study, Risk Reduction for Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (rrAD), that further investigates the link between exercise and cognitive decline.\n\u201cThere are likely some people who benefit more from exercise than others,\u201d says Cullum. \u201cBut with the sample size in this study, it was hard to analyze subgroups of people to make those conclusions.\u201d\nStill, the data are important to help explain the effects of exercise on the brain and why it can be beneficial, say Zhang and Cullum, who are members of the Peter O\u2019Donnell Jr. Brain Institute.\n\u201cHaving physiological findings like this can also be useful for physicians when they talk to their patients about the benefits of exercise,\u201d says Zhang. \u201cWe now know, based on a randomized, controlled trial, that exercise can increase blood flow to the brain, which is a good thing.\u201d\nCullum holds the Pam Blumenthal Distinguished Professorship in Clinical Psychology at UT Southwestern.\nOther UTSW researchers who contributed to this study were Tsubasa Tomoto, Danilo Cardim, Takashi Tarumi and Linda Hynan. Collaborators were Jie Liu of Rutgers University; Benjamin Tseng of the University of Texas at Tyler; and Evan Pasha of Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas.\nThis research was supported with funds from the National Institutes of Health (R01AG033106 and R01HL102457).\nNews Team 214-648-3404 Email\nCopyright 2024.

Perhaps not as well understood is the importance of regular physical activity in building and maintaining healthy bones. Inactivity causes loss of bone!\nAging, along with certain diseases and medications, can cause bones to become very weak and fragile over time \u2014 a condition called osteoporosis. It often occurs in women after menopause, and in men in older age. This bone-thinning disease puts people at greater risk for broken bones, which can seriously limit mobility and independence.\nWe also tend to lose muscle as we age \u2014 a condition called sarcopenia. People who develop osteoporosis or sarcopenia are considered frail: more likely to fall and more likely to break a bone.\nExercise works on bones much like it works on muscles \u2014 it makes them stronger. Exercise is important for building strong bones when we are younger, and it is essential for maintaining bone strength when we are older. Because bone is living tissue, it changes over time in response to the forces placed upon it. When you exercise regularly, your bone adapts by building more bone and becoming denser. This improvement in bone requires good nutrition, including adequate calcium and Vitamin D.\nAnother benefit of exercise is that it improves balance and coordination. This becomes especially important as we get older because it helps to prevent falls and the broken bones that may result.\nRegular physical activity helps build and maintain healthy bones.\nmonkeybusinessimages/iStock/Getty Images Plus\nThere are many different types of exercise and they all offer health benefits. The two types that are most effective for building strong bones are weight-bearing exercise and strength-training exercise. Exercises to improve bone strength are site-specific. For example, walking can improve bone strength in the legs and spine but not in the wrist.\nPostural stretching and strengthening can help prevent or decrease the amount of upper spine slumping seen in many older people. Leaning over to tie your shoes or sweeping and mopping can lead to spine fractures in people at high risk of spine fracture. Try to maintain good spine posture with all your activities.\nWeightbearing describes any activity you do on your feet that works your bones and muscles against gravity. When your feet and legs carry your body weight, more stress is placed on your bones, making your bones work harder. Weightbearing exercise after young adulthood can help prevent further bone loss and strengthen bone.\nExamples of weightbearing exercise include:\nHigher impact activities, such as jogging and jumping rope, increase the weight on bones and provide more bone-strengthening benefits. However, people who are frail or who have already been diagnosed with thinning bone should talk to their doctors about the types of physical activity that would be best for them.\nJogging and other weightbearing exercises force you to work against gravity.\nm-imagephotography/iStock/Getty Images Plus\nDuring strength-training activities, resistance is added to movement in order to make muscles work harder and, over time, become stronger. Although resistance exercises focus on increasing muscle mass, they also put stress on bones and have bone-building capacity.\nCommon types of strength training include weight machines, free weights, and exercises (such as push-ups) that use your own body weight. Elastic bands can also be used to add resistance to exercises.\nA general guideline for strength training is to exercise each major muscle group at least twice a week. Be sure to rest for a full day between strength sessions.\nUsing free weights helps increase muscle mass and strengthen bones.\n\u00a9 Thinkstock, 2012\nNon-impact exercises, such as yoga and tai chi, are not as effective at strengthening bone, but provide significant flexibility and balance training benefits.\nNon-weightbearing exercises, such as swimming, cycling, and chair exercises, do not increase bone density but are excellent choices to strengthen muscles as well as the heart and lungs. If you have a musculoskeletal health condition, such as arthritis, that prevents you from doing weightbearing activities, these are good alternatives.\nRelated Articles\nBone Health Basics\nExercise Walking\nCalcium, Nutrition, and Bone Health\nAn effective exercise program for bone health includes 30 minutes of weightbearing activity, four or more days a week. To help you stay motivated, choose an activity that you enjoy. There are many activities that will get you on your feet and moving.\nYour 30 minutes of exercise can be done all in one stretch or broken up into shorter intervals. A 10-minute brisk walk three times a day is a great way to get started.\nIf it is not safe to walk outside, walking throughout your house, climbing stairs indoors and even walking in place are all great weight-bearing exercises.\nTo really reap the benefits of exercise, you need to add flexibility and balance training to the mix. All exercise sessions should end with stretching. Increasing your flexibility improves your ability to move easily, can reduce your risk of injury, and provides mental relaxation benefits.\nBefore choosing an activity, it is important to consider your risk of falling. Your doctor and a physical therapist can help you plan your exercise program.\nPeople with severe osteoporosis should be careful weightlifting with their arms while standing upright to avoid excessive spine compression (10-20 pounds may be safe).

For example. High et al. [4] assessed soreness at 24 and 48 hours after eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors. Soreness scores were higher at the 48 hour follow-up. Similarly, Byrnes et al. [5] reported that muscle soreness steadily increased when measured 6, 18 and 42 hours following 30 minutes of downhill treadmill running. Soreness has also been found to be higher at 48 hours than at 24 hours in untreated controls undertaking bench-stepping [2] and to peak at 48 hours in three separate studies of eccentric exercise of the elbow flexors [6-8]. In our own studies of soreness following bench-stepping, soreness scores peaked at 48 hours [9] (see figure 1). Perhaps the only study inconsistent with these findings was that of Donelly et al, who found that soreness induced by downhill running on a treadmill was slightly higher at 24 than at 48 hours [3]. That said, a classic inverted U-shaped curve was reported, with soreness low immediately following exercise, highest at 24 and 48 hours and falling again at 72 hours. Such findings are so prevalent that post-exercise muscle soreness is generally described in the literature as \"delayed-onset\" muscle soreness.\nTime course of muscle soreness following long-distance running and benchstepping\nThe studies above involved exercise undertaken in a laboratory setting. With rare exceptions [10], post-exercise soreness has not been investigated in athletes undertaking their chosen sport. Whilst conducting data analysis on a study of long distance running, we noticed that soreness seemed to peak immediately and then reduce gradually over time (see figure 1). This was a similar time course to two previous studies in long-distance runners for which we had obtained original data [11,12]. We therefore decided to examine the hypothesis that the time course of post-exercise soreness is different for long-distance running than for bench-stepping by examining data from three clinical trials we had completed. If the time course of soreness resulting from an \"artificial\" laboratory based exercise (bench-stepping) is different from that resulting from a sport (long-distance running) it is plausible that these two methods of soreness induction have different physiological consequences.\nWe compared data from a study in which soreness was induced by a bench-stepping regime with those from a trial in which soreness resulted from long-distance running. In the bench-stepping trial, healthy volunteers undertook a 10 minute period of bench-stepping while carrying a backpack containing sandbags equivalent to 10% of their body weight. This is a previously validated method of soreness induction [2]. Only untrained individuals were eligible. Subjects were excluded if they regularly participated in vigorous exercise in the previous six months. \"Vigorous exercise\" was defined as playing a sport or undertaking an activity designed to increase physical fitness; \"regular participation\" was defined as undertaking the activity three or more times a week for more than three consecutive weeks and for more than 15 minutes at a time. We included data from 82 subjects in two trials in which the eligibility criteria and method of soreness induction were identical [9]. The running trial studied 400 runners expecting soreness after a long-distance run [13]. Subjects took part in a number of different runs. Mean race length was 21.4 miles SD (7.79). The shortest race was just under 2 miles (one subject) and the longest 50 miles (one subject) but 95% of the races were between 6.2 and 26.2 miles. Approximat\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

DISCUSSION GRANTS DISCLOSURES REFERENCES Information & Authors Metrics & Citations View Options References Figures Tables Media Share Abstract Increased muscle mitochondria are largely responsible for the increased resistance to fatigue and health benefits ascribed to exercise training. However, very little attention has been given to the likely benefits of increased brain mitochondria in this regard. We examined the effects of exercise training on markers of both brain and muscle mitochondrial biogenesis in relation to endurance capacity assessed by a treadmill run to fatigue (RTF) in mice. Male ICR mice were assigned to exercise (EX) or sedentary (SED) conditions (n = 16\u201319/group). EX mice performed 8 wk of treadmill running for 1 h/day, 6 days/wk at 25 m/min and a 5% incline. Twenty-four hours after the last training bout a subgroup of mice (n = 9\u201311/group) were euthanized, and brain (brain stem, cerebellum, cortex, frontal lobe, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and midbrain) and muscle (soleus) tissues were isolated for analysis of mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1-alpha (PGC-1\u03b1), Silent Information Regulator T1 (SIRT1), citrate synthase (CS), and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) using RT-PCR. A different subgroup of EX and SED mice (n = 7\u20138/group) performed a treadmill RTF test. Exercise training increased PGC-1\u03b1, SIRT1, and CS mRNA and mtDNA in most brain regions in addition to the soleus (P < 0.05). Mean treadmill RTF increased from 74.0 \u00b1 9.6 min to 126.5 \u00b1 16.1 min following training (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that exercise training increases brain mitochondrial biogenesis, which may have important implications, not only with regard to fatigue, but also with respect to various central nervous system diseases and age-related dementia that are often characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction. it is well established that exercise training induces an increase in muscle mitochondria, resulting in fatigue resistance and enhanced endurance performance (13). Improved mitochondrial function is also a major factor in exercise-associated health benefits, including prevention of chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease and diabetes (10, 29). However, little research has focused on the mitochondrial response to exercise training in the brain. The available research is limited to two reports of exercise-induced changes in mitochondrial activity in the hippocampus of rats (9, 15), and several reports involving attenuated age-associated declines in mitochondrial activity (2, 21, 23, 24), including maintenance of respiratory chain complexes I and VI activity in isolated mitochondria (24), and Silent Information Regulator T1 (SIRT1) expression in the cerebellum (21). Given the important role of mitochondrial dysfunction in various psychological disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, the implications for an exercise-induced increase in brain mitochondrial biogenesis are vast. Further, an exercise-induced increase in brain mitochondrial biogenesis may contribute to decreased central fatigue and improved exercise performance, although this hypothesis has not yet been tested. Mitochondrial biogenesis can be promoted via an increase in the transcriptional coactivators SIRT1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1\u03b1) (12, 28). SIRT1 physically interacts with, deacetylates, and activates PGC-1\u03b1, which is considered the \u201cmaster regulator\u201d of mitochondrial biogenesis as it coactivates transcription factors and nuclear receptors regulating mitochondrial protein expression (12, 28, 31, 32). Both acute and chronic exercise have been reported to activate PGC-1\u03b1 in skeletal muscle, which has been linked to an increase in mitochondrial proteins and improvements in exercise performance (3, 38, 39, 43).

DISCUSSION GRANTS DISCLOSURES REFERENCES Information & Authors Metrics & Citations View Options References Figures Tables Media Share Abstract Increased muscle mitochondria are largely responsible for the increased resistance to fatigue and health benefits ascribed to exercise training. However, very little attention has been given to the likely benefits of increased brain mitochondria in this regard. We examined the effects of exercise training on markers of both brain and muscle mitochondrial biogenesis in relation to endurance capacity assessed by a treadmill run to fatigue (RTF) in mice. Male ICR mice were assigned to exercise (EX) or sedentary (SED) conditions (n = 16\u201319/group). EX mice performed 8 wk of treadmill running for 1 h/day, 6 days/wk at 25 m/min and a 5% incline. Twenty-four hours after the last training bout a subgroup of mice (n = 9\u201311/group) were euthanized, and brain (brain stem, cerebellum, cortex, frontal lobe, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and midbrain) and muscle (soleus) tissues were isolated for analysis of mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1-alpha (PGC-1\u03b1), Silent Information Regulator T1 (SIRT1), citrate synthase (CS), and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) using RT-PCR. A different subgroup of EX and SED mice (n = 7\u20138/group) performed a treadmill RTF test. Exercise training increased PGC-1\u03b1, SIRT1, and CS mRNA and mtDNA in most brain regions in addition to the soleus (P < 0.05). Mean treadmill RTF increased from 74.0 \u00b1 9.6 min to 126.5 \u00b1 16.1 min following training (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that exercise training increases brain mitochondrial biogenesis, which may have important implications, not only with regard to fatigue, but also with respect to various central nervous system diseases and age-related dementia that are often characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction. it is well established that exercise training induces an increase in muscle mitochondria, resulting in fatigue resistance and enhanced endurance performance (13). Improved mitochondrial function is also a major factor in exercise-associated health benefits, including prevention of chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease and diabetes (10, 29). However, little research has focused on the mitochondrial response to exercise training in the brain. The available research is limited to two reports of exercise-induced changes in mitochondrial activity in the hippocampus of rats (9, 15), and several reports involving attenuated age-associated declines in mitochondrial activity (2, 21, 23, 24), including maintenance of respiratory chain complexes I and VI activity in isolated mitochondria (24), and Silent Information Regulator T1 (SIRT1) expression in the cerebellum (21). Given the important role of mitochondrial dysfunction in various psychological disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, the implications for an exercise-induced increase in brain mitochondrial biogenesis are vast. Further, an exercise-induced increase in brain mitochondrial biogenesis may contribute to decreased central fatigue and improved exercise performance, although this hypothesis has not yet been tested. Mitochondrial biogenesis can be promoted via an increase in the transcriptional coactivators SIRT1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1\u03b1) (12, 28). SIRT1 physically interacts with, deacetylates, and activates PGC-1\u03b1, which is considered the \u201cmaster regulator\u201d of mitochondrial biogenesis as it coactivates transcription factors and nuclear receptors regulating mitochondrial protein expression (12, 28, 31, 32). Both acute and chronic exercise have been reported to activate PGC-1\u03b1 in skeletal muscle, which has been linked to an increase in mitochondrial proteins and improvements in exercise performance (3, 38, 39, 43). Calvo et al. (3) has shown that muscle-specific overexpression of PGC-1\u03b1 in mice increases voluntary exercise (wheel cage activity), maximal oxygen consumption, and endurance performance, as well as mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and mitochondrial enzyme activity.

However, it has been ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nSkeletal muscles require the proper production and distribution of energy to sustain their work. To ensure this requirement is met, mitochondria form large networks within skeletal muscle cells, and during exercise, they can enhance their functions. In the present review, we discuss recent findings on exercise-induced mitochondrial adaptations. We emphasize the importance of mitochondrial biogenesis, morphological changes, and increases in respiratory supercomplex formation as mechanisms triggered by exercise that may increase the function of skeletal muscles. Finally, we highlight the possible effects of nutraceutical compounds on mitochondrial performance during exercise and outline the use of exercise as a therapeutic tool in noncommunicable disease prevention. The resulting picture shows that the modulation of mitochondrial activity by exercise is not only fundamental for physical performance but also a key point for whole-organism well-being.\nCommonly speaking, exercise is a physical activity that works the body at greater intensity than usual movements. To work at higher intensity, the body, particularly the skeletal muscles and the cardiovascular system, requires an extra supply of energy. Mitochondria are the main energy suppliers that coordinate AT production, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and calcium signaling, which are fundamental processes for sustaining body activity during exercise. Thus, exercise and mitochondria are in a close relationship and influence each other. This review is focused on this relationship, providing an overview of the most relevant works in the literature. Moreover, since diet can influence mitochondrial activity, we discuss how the use of some nutraceutical products can modulate physical performance. Lastly, we underline the use of exercise as a cost-effective primary intervention to prevent and delay metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. Thus, the exercise-mitochondria interaction is not only an energetic matter but also an important aspect that must be understood to improve the use of exercise for both community members and athletes.\nMitochondria are defined as the energetic center of cells because they are the site of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system. The OXPHOS system is located in the mitochondrial cristae and is composed of the complexes of the electron transport chain (ETC) and the ATP synthase. The four complexes of the ETC are complex I (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase), complex II (succinate-quinone oxidoreductase), complex III (ubiquinol-cytochrome bc1 oxidoreductase), and complex IV (cytochrome c reductase). Using ubiquinone and cytochrome c, these complexes couple electron transport with proton pumping to generate a gradient that is used by ATP synthase to phosphorylate ADP and produce ATP. For decades, it was thought that the mitochondrial respiratory complexes were found as isolated entities [1]. However, it is currently widely accepted that respiratory complexes can be assembled into supramolecular entities called supercomplexes (SCs) [2, 3] whose structures have been described in detail, though not fully characterized, by several important and elegant studies involving cryo-EM [4\u20136]. SCs have been described in different organizations from yeast to plants and mammals [2, 7\u201310]. Accordingly, in the plasticity model, SCs and complexes can coexist and have dynamic interactions [7] that can be modulated by tissue-specific subunits [11] according to the energetic requirement of the cells [12, 13]. It has been demonstrated that SCs can (i) enhance the efficiency of electron flux by segmentation of the CoQ pool [14], (ii) prevent ROS formation by complex I and complex III as demonstrated by Lenaz and Genova [15] and (iii) improve the stability of the individual respiratory complexes [16\u201318]. However, many questions remain in the field, particularly if SC assembly is necessary for enhancing mitochondrial respiratory efficiency and what role SCs play in sustaining and determining metabolism. More evidence is required to definitively answer these questions and define the roles of SCs.\nThe discovery of the first bona fide SC assembly factor, supercomplex assembly factor 1 (SCAF1) [12], demonstrated that SCs are genetically regulated structures. SCAF1 is a small protein of 13 kDa that is homologous to the CIV subunit Cox7a2. SCAF1 brings together CIII and IV. Surprisingly, CD1 and SV129 mice have the wild-type protein, while C57BL/6J and Balb/cJ mice suffer a mutation that displaces a critical histidine residue in the matrix-exposed domain that is important for the interaction with CIV. As a result, liver mitochondria from C57BL/6J and Balb/cJ mice do not have III2+IV and I+III2+IV (either defined as the respirosome). This different organization of the respiratory chain determines higher respiration rates and ATP production in C57BL/6J and Balb/cJ mice when fueled with pyruvate/malate (NADH route) or succinate (FADH2) that cannot be increased with the simultaneous fueling of both substrates as in CD1 and SV129 mitochondria. Our proposed model suggests that SCAF1, by defining three different populations of IV (the first linked to I and receiving the electron from the route of NADH, the second associated with III2 and dedicated to the route of FADH2, and a third that can receive the electrons from both routes), prevents saturation of electron channeling with one substrate, promoting the optimal use of energetic substrates, and suggests the existence of preferential pools of coenzyme Q (CoQ).\nHowever, since the heart and muscle mitochondria from C57BL/6J mice retain a significant amount of respirosome [11], some authors doubt that SCAF1 is required for its formation [19, 20] and for the channeling of electrons through preferential pools of CoQ. From a structural point of view, using extensive proteomic analysis, we demonstrated that the respirosome from BL6 mice incorporates the COX7A2 subunit, which is specific to t\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Finally, we highlight the possible effects of nutraceutical compounds on mitochondrial performance during exercise and outline the use of exercise as a therapeutic tool in noncommunicable disease prevention. The resulting picture shows that the modulation of mitochondrial activity by exercise is not only fundamental for physical performance but also a key point for whole-organism well-being.\nCommonly speaking, exercise is a physical activity that works the body at greater intensity than usual movements. To work at higher intensity, the body, particularly the skeletal muscles and the cardiovascular system, requires an extra supply of energy. Mitochondria are the main energy suppliers that coordinate AT production, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and calcium signaling, which are fundamental processes for sustaining body activity during exercise. Thus, exercise and mitochondria are in a close relationship and influence each other. This review is focused on this relationship, providing an overview of the most relevant works in the literature. Moreover, since diet can influence mitochondrial activity, we discuss how the use of some nutraceutical products can modulate physical performance. Lastly, we underline the use of exercise as a cost-effective primary intervention to prevent and delay metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. Thus, the exercise-mitochondria interaction is not only an energetic matter but also an important aspect that must be understood to improve the use of exercise for both community members and athletes.\nMitochondria are defined as the energetic center of cells because they are the site of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system. The OXPHOS system is located in the mitochondrial cristae and is composed of the complexes of the electron transport chain (ETC) and the ATP synthase. The four complexes of the ETC are complex I (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase), complex II (succinate-quinone oxidoreductase), complex III (ubiquinol-cytochrome bc1 oxidoreductase), and complex IV (cytochrome c reductase). Using ubiquinone and cytochrome c, these complexes couple electron transport with proton pumping to generate a gradient that is used by ATP synthase to phosphorylate ADP and produce ATP. For decades, it was thought that the mitochondrial respiratory complexes were found as isolated entities [1]. However, it is currently widely accepted that respiratory complexes can be assembled into supramolecular entities called supercomplexes (SCs) [2, 3] whose structures have been described in detail, though not fully characterized, by several important and elegant studies involving cryo-EM [4\u20136]. SCs have been described in different organizations from yeast to plants and mammals [2, 7\u201310]. Accordingly, in the plasticity model, SCs and complexes can coexist and have dynamic interactions [7] that can be modulated by tissue-specific subunits [11] according to the energetic requirement of the cells [12, 13]. It has been demonstrated that SCs can (i) enhance the efficiency of electron flux by segmentation of the CoQ pool [14], (ii) prevent ROS formation by complex I and complex III as demonstrated by Lenaz and Genova [15] and (iii) improve the stability of the individual respiratory complexes [16\u201318]. However, many questions remain in the field, particularly if SC assembly is necessary for enhancing mitochondrial respiratory efficiency and what role SCs play in sustaining and determining metabolism. More evidence is required to definitively answer these questions and define the roles of SCs.\nThe discovery of the first bona fide SC assembly factor, supercomplex assembly factor 1 (SCAF1) [12], demonstrated that SCs are genetically regulated structures. SCAF1 is a small protein of 13 kDa that is homologous to the CIV subunit Cox7a2. SCAF1 brings together CIII and IV. Surprisingly, CD1 and SV129 mice have the wild-type protein, while C57BL/6J and Balb/cJ mice suffer a mutation that displaces a critical histidine residue in the matrix-exposed domain that is important for the interaction with CIV. As a result, liver mitochondria from C57BL/6J and Balb/cJ mice do not have III2+IV and I+III2+IV (either defined as the respirosome). This different organization of the respiratory chain determines higher respiration rates and ATP production in C57BL/6J and Balb/cJ mice when fueled with pyruvate/malate (NADH route) or succinate (FADH2) that cannot be increased with the simultaneous fueling of both substrates as in CD1 and SV129 mitochondria. Our proposed model suggests that SCAF1, by defining three different populations of IV (the first linked to I and receiving the electron from the route of NADH, the second associated with III2 and dedicated to the route of FADH2, and a third that can receive the electrons from both routes), prevents saturation of electron channeling with one substrate, promoting the optimal use of energetic substrates, and suggests the existence of preferential pools of coenzyme Q (CoQ).\nHowever, since the heart and muscle mitochondria from C57BL/6J mice retain a significant amount of respirosome [11], some authors doubt that SCAF1 is required for its formation [19, 20] and for the channeling of electrons through preferential pools of CoQ. From a structural point of view, using extensive proteomic analysis, we demonstrated that the respirosome from BL6 mice incorporates the COX7A2 subunit, which is specific to t\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Why Trust Us?\nDuring aerobic exercise, most of the energy your muscle cells need is supplied by the mitochondria, a cellular component often referred to as the \"powerhouse\" of the cell. That\u2019s why one of the key benefits of training is that you develop more and better-functioning mitochondria to fuel your efforts.\nAt last week\u2019s American College of Sports Medicine annual meeting, one of the most interesting sessions I went to focused on how mitochondria respond to training. The central question posed in a talk by David Bishop, of Victoria University in Australia, was: Is there an optimal training stimulus to trigger the formation of new and more powerful mitochondria? (The slides from the presentation are available here.)\nAs Bishop and his colleagues explained in a review a few years ago, there are two linked questions. First, how much new mitochondria can your cells grow? And second, how efficiently can each unit of mitochondria supply the energy needed for muscular contractions?\nThe safest answer is that we don\u2019t know for sure at this point. But several studies in both rats and humans, including one published by Bishop and his colleagues earlier this year, suggest the following rule of thumb: How much you train determines how much mitochondria your cells will contain; and how intensely you train determines how powerful each unit of mitochondria is.\nIn the recent study, neither continuous sub-threshold training nor long interval workouts of 4-7 x 4:00 at 90 percent of peak power (the highest power reached in a VO2max test on a stationary bike) changed mitochondrial function, but sprint workouts of 4-10 x 30 seconds at 200 percent of peak power of did boost mitochondrial function. You needed that very high intensity to boost the output of each mitochondria. On the other hand, none of the workouts, done three times a week, increased the overall amount of mitochondria after four weeks.\nIn contrast, a more recent unpublished study by the same group put subjects through interval workouts twice a day, seven days a week (!), for three weeks. This time, a marker of the amount of mitochondria increased by 40 percent. To get more mitochondria, in other words, you need to accumulate volume.\nAs Bishop pointed out during the talk, these results fit nicely with the \u201cpolarized training\u201d paradigm observed by Stephen Seiler\u2014the idea that top endurance athletes generally accumulate high volumes of training at low intensities, but also include a small amount, perhaps 10 to 20 percent of the total, at very high intensities. That combination of high volume and high intensity (but not both at once) presumably gives athletes huge amounts of very potent mitochondria.\nOf course, when you hear a nice, tidy story like this that seems to make perfect sense, warning bells should be ringing. And sure enough, not everyone agrees with this picture.\nI had a chance to chat later in the conference with Martin MacInnis, a postdoc in Martin Gibala\u2019s lab at McMaster University. MacInnis was presenting some new data at the conference that compared 30 minutes of continuous training with an interval workout of 4 x 5:00 hard at 65 percent of peak power with 2:30 recovery, with the intensities chosen so that both groups did the same amount of total work.\nOne of the cool things about this study is that the workouts weren\u2019t assigned to different people\u2014instead, they were assigned to different legs on the same people! By using single-leg cycling, all the other extraneous factors, from genetic variation to stress and diet, were held constant in each comparison.\nAfter six workouts over two weeks, the interval leg saw bigger improvements in both the amount of mitochondria and how well each mitochondria functioned compared to the continuous-cycling leg. That fits with the idea that intensity is what triggers improvements in function, but it doesn\u2019t fit with the idea that the amount of mitochondria depends on the volume of training, since both legs completed the same amount of work.\nHow do we reconcile this seeming contradiction? More studies, I guess. Ultimately, as I\u2019m sure Bishop would agree, the picture is never going to be quite as simple as \u201cintensity does only one thing and volume does only another,\u201d but it may still turn out that the general trend holds true.\nOne final postscript: While I was waiting to chat to MacInnis at his poster, a Japanese researcher was asking him lots of questions. Eventually, the researcher pulled out his card, and I saw MacInnis\u2019s eyebrows rise by an inch. I peeked over his shoulder, and mine did the same when I saw the name on the card: Izumi Tabata. Yes, that Tabata, he of the 20-seconds-hard, 10-seconds-easy Tabata Protocol. It was a cool moment, sort of like going to a car show and bumping into Henry Ford, and suddenly remembering that behind the famous name is an actual person.\n***\nDiscuss this post on the Sweat Science Facebook page or on Twitter, get the latest posts via e-mail digest, and check out the Sweat Science book!\n10 Editor-Approved Running Tips for 2026\n3 Glute Activation Exercises Runners Need\nWhat's the Next Step In Your Running Journey?\nHow to Run Hills Better By Improving Your Form\nCan My Treadmill HIIT Class Get Me Faster?\nHow Many Miles You Should Run in a Week\nUnlock Faster Paces With a Plyometric Warmup\nHow to Pick Between Long, Slow or Fast, Short Walk\nYou Crushed Your Marathon.
