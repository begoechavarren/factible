    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nhere's my favorite way to jump start health get off medications bolster your immune system and cut off the weight and burn the fat very quickly a three-day juice cleanse comes straight from an alternative cancer center so specific ingredients i'm going to show you in just a moment that is used to bolster the immune system and if done right based on research out of california you can crank up not only your fat loss but your immune system it literally starts to clean out your body if you do it the right way i'm going to show you the absolute keys when it comes to a three-day juice cleanse if you want to venture in just to one day or two day that's gonna be fantastic as well but i encourage followers of the living good daily lifestyle to do this once a month once a month cleaning this out you can throw this at any time especially if you're up against a wall you've been stuck you need progress you just had a bad vacation you fell off the wagon got ran over by the wagon you need to bounce back quickly here is exactly how to do it and the keys but let me talk a little bit more about the benefits of green juice and specifically just drinking that all day long it's going to lower your insulin if you make it right which i'm going to show you in just a few moments of how to make it proper so you don't raise insulin you're going to be lowering it which is an absolute key for getting the fat off the body it's going to help increase your human growth hormone that's right it increases the hormones that build muscle the more muscle you have you crank up the more metabolism a lot of people think you're going to lose a lot of muscle this way but if you do do it right you can actually gain it's going to increase that weight loss it's going to crank up that fat burning machine because you're going to be detoxing so much so many people when they start burning fat the fat contains toxins the toxins are released into the system they're floating around the blood and if they are not eliminated quickly they just take back up into tissue somewhere else and they're restored as fat it's called the rebounding effect so we want to increase weight loss by detoxing the system energy is going up you are putting in so much water so much cleansing so many nutrients when you're doing a juice cleanse like this and then if you do it proper which i'm gonna show you the ingredients in a moment you hit autophagy ding that's like the magic autophagy that is where your body starts recycling if you're not putting in lots of food because you're doing a green juice cleanse you're put your body starts to find other raw materials to make cells out of like old stuff sitting around the scrap pieces of wood and metal viruses microbes it cleans house that's where you want to be if you want long living graceful aging and less disease autophagy is where you want to be it aids the gut it aids the probiotics it gives that digestive system the nutrients that it needs to build up the microbiome which by the way makes up 70 plus percent of your immune system it gives the digestive system a rest some of you have not gone a day your entire life without eating give it a break so much of your energy there isn't a thing you could possibly do on this planet that would expend more energy than your digestive system does on a daily basis not a marathon not anything your digestive system takes a bulk of your energy if you give it a break your energy is going up you're going to feel great so those are the benefits of green juicing what are the keys based on a alternative cancer center that helps people through alternative ways of taking care of their cancer this comes straight from them and it nothing magical nothing proprietary but it helped me to understand this better to keep insulin down and get all the benefits of green juice here's what i used to make it out of number one are green apples granny smiths the red ones have a higher sugar content which is going to spike insulin more we want to keep this lower carbohydrate so we can get into autophagy so make sure the apples are green cucumbers oh you can see the video below for cucumbers their benefits i love cucumbers plus you get a lot of juice out of them so when you are juicing these vegetables it goes much further so i like to add several of those lemons fantastic one of the most nutritious fruits that there is contains a plethora of vitamins all the vitamins you need right there in that lemon celery another one there's a video below for you to check out the extreme effects of celery amazing for your digestive tract especially your stomach and for supporting your liver and detoxing you spinach is next great source of did i spell spinach let me make that an h great source of iron and other vital minerals that you can get in so that goes always kale this is always at the top of the scoring system if you go to the grocery store some grocery stores have this most nutritious food bam kale's always at the top of it broccoli i love broccoli it's so good there's a video below to help you fall in love with broccoli as well i eat this almost every day it is very anti-cancer next is parsley there's another parsley video as well parsley juice is incredible for uh vitamin c antioxidants iron it has more iron than spinach so it's really good for anemia it helps support so many different things parsley is a big one folic acid helps keep homocysteine down lowers your inflammation and then finally you can add in some dandelion which has a very good detox of iron effect so that's what i make the green juice out of you're going to want to get while you're doing this juice cleanse you're going to be taking in water in between the juice you're going to want to get in between 64 and 128 ounces of the juice i would aim for 64s if it's your first time doing it but you can make it out of this one of these if you're following uh will make if you do it proper 32 ounces you'll need to make a couple of them you can use greens powder which already has things like dried parsley dried broccoli dried kale dry spinach try celery dry cucumbers already in there and that greens powder is linked below so i use that in conjunction i just have this for breakfast each morning but you would be just drinking just this i combine the juice with the greens powder to get extra nutrients but it keeps low insulin because it's low carbohydrate that's key with the juice and with the juice powder you can also add in broth or collagen these are very insulin friendly they're going to help your gut during this process they're not going to spike that insulin level and if you like enjoying your tea and your coffee that's great maybe cut back on the milk or the dairy the creamer especially no sugars in there but if you do want a little bit of that so you don't involve like a headache or something wow

Still, you want to know: Isn't there something besides intense workouts and healthy food that can help you make gains a little faster, something that will give you a muscle-building edge, with less effort? Definitely. There are several things you can do to pack on lean muscle. Unfortunately, not all of them are safe - or legal. Anabolic steroids, though approved for medical use and available by prescription only, are among the most abused drugs among athletes. \"Anabolic\" means \"to build,\" and anabolic steroids tend to make the body grow in certain ways. They do have muscle-building effects, but they are dangerous and life threatening. Once practiced mainly by elite athletes, anabolic steroid abuse has spread to recreational and teen athletes and is now a national health concern. Research shows that among teenagers, 40 percent of kids under age 15 have tried anabolic steroids. In addition to steroids, athletes use other types of drugs including stimulants, pain killers, diuretics, and drugs that mask the presence of certain drugs in the urine. Synthetic growth hormone (GH) is used by athletes as well, because they believe it will increase strength and muscle mass. GH has many horrible side effects, including progressive overgrowth of body tissues, coronary heart disease, diabetes, and arthritis. GH is one of more than 100 drugs that has been banned by the International Olympic Committee. The full list of banned substances appears in table 7.2. Notice that not one of these substances is nutritional; they are drugs and not food substances. Here's the good news. Forget health-destroying drugs. There are some natural aids you can use to enhance muscle building, give you an extra edge in training, and generally keep your body in healthy balance. Most involve dietary manipulations; some require the use of special supplemental products. Here is a roundup of those aids, from high-calorie supplementation to creatine, that will help you develop your physique and improve your performance in the gym.\nThe single most important nutritional factor affecting muscle gain is calories, specifically calories from carbohydrates. Building muscle requires an intense, rigorous strength-training program. A tremendous amount of energy is required to fuel this type of exercise - energy that is best supplied by carbs. A high-carbohydrate diet allows for the greatest recovery of muscle glycogen stores on a daily basis. This ongoing replenishment lets your muscles work equally hard on successive days. Studies continue to show that high-calorie, high-carbohydrate diets give strength-trained athletes the edge in their workouts. Here is the bottom line: The harder you train, the more muscle you can build. To build a pound of muscle, add 2,500 calories a week. This means introducing extra calories into your diet. Ideally, you must increase your calories by 500 to 1,000 a day. But do this gradually, so you don't gain too much fat. What I suggest to strength trainers in a building phase is to start by introducing only 300 to 350 calories a day for a while. Then after a week or two, increase to 500 calories a day. As long as you are not gaining fat, start introducing 1,000 extra calories into your diet daily. Most of these additional calories should come from carbohydrates in the form of food and liquid carbohydrate supplements. An example of 1,000 calories worth of carbs from food is two cups of pasta, two bagels, and two bananas. It just doesn't take that much additional food to up your carbs. To be really exact, you can match your carb intake to your weight. As a strength trainer who wants to build muscle, you should take in about nine grams of carbohydrate per kilogram of body weight a day. If you are an athlete who cross trains with strength training and you want to build, figure about 10 grams of carb per kilogram of body weight a day. Supplementing with liquid carbs is an excellent way to increase those calories. Plus, it appears to support muscle growth. In a landmark experiment, competitive weightlifters took a liquid high-calorie supplement for 15 weeks. The goal of the study was to see how the supplement affected the athletes' weight gain, body composition, and strength. The weightlifters were divided into three groups: those using the supplement and no anabolic steroids, those using the supplement plus anabolic steroids, and a control group taking no supplements or steroids but participating in exercise. The supplement contained 540 calories and 70.5 grams of carbohydrate, plus other nutrients. All the participants followed their usual diets. The supplement-plus-steroid group and the control group ate most of their calories from fat rather than carbs (45 percent fat, 37 percent carbohydrate). The supplement-only group ate more carbs and less fat (34 percent fat, 47 per\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The reduced antioxidant defence leads to defective elimination of ROS and consequently, delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS). DOMS due to exhaustive or prolonged exercise typically peaks between 24 h and 72 h after exercise results in soreness, inflammation, pain and decreased muscle function. As a result, muscle strength will be reduced progressively and this situation might be detrimental to one\u2019s athletic performance, especially amidst competition season. Therefore, supplementation to improve muscle recovery and sports performance has become a common practice among athletes. However, it is suggested to consume natural-based fruit-derived antioxidants as a more effective and safe nutritional strategy. Fruits containing a high amount of polyphenol protect muscle cells from excessive and harmful ROS due to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant characteristics. To date, there are several expended studies on the consumption of supplements from various antioxidant-rich fruits to provide evidence on their effectiveness, giving better solutions and wider choices of supplementation to the athletes. Therefore, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of nutritional standpoint from previous literature on the effect of fruit juices supplementation on muscle recovery and sports performance.\nKeywords: sports nutrition, antioxidant, fruit juice, delayed-onset muscle soreness, exercise performance\nExhaustive and strenuous exercise has been shown to cause skeletal muscle damage and has been implicated as one of the factors leading to delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS) (1, 2). Strenuous exercise might also increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, leading to an imbalance between antioxidants and ROS (3). The reduced antioxidant defence might affect the elimination of ROS, leading to DOMS (4). DOMS following exercise depends on the type and the severity of exercise and usually peaks between 24 h and 72 h after exercise (5). This period is crucial for athletes during training and competition when there is a limited duration for recovery (2).\nExercise-induced skeletal muscle damage (EIMD) is a common complication of strenuous physical activity. Many studies have found that instantly after strenuous physical activity, biomarkers of skeletal muscle damage such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), myoglobin and creatinine kinase (CK) levels are increased significantly, often more than 5-fold\u2013100-fold (6\u20138). A study by Park et al. (7) observed athletes for a longer duration after a race found that these skeletal muscle damage biomarkers will return to normal after 7 days\u201310 days with proper post-race recovery. However, these damages may affect their performance and limit their potential during events since they only have a limited time allocation for recovery.\nFriden et al. (9) explained the complex mechanism of muscle damage. It was described as a mechanical imbalance between adjacent sarcomere, the breakdown of the sarcotubular system, myofibrillar disruption, cytoskeletal damage and defect on the extracellular myofiber matrix. According to Owens et al. (1), the postulated mechanism can be summarised into two phases. First, the mechanical work that causes the primary damage and second, the inflammatory response processes propagating tissue damage and causing secondary damage. The primary damage due to prolonged mechanical load caused coupling failure of the sarcomere and sarcolemma from eccentric lengthening and excitation-contraction (E\u2013C) (1, 10, 11). The primary phase triggered the cascade of the secondary phase, where there is an influx of Ca2+ into the cytoplasm to maintain homeostasis causes further damage (12\u201314). In this light, the secondary cascade increased the production of ROS and oxidative stress, which causes DOMS (12).\nExercise-induced muscle damages, which cause inflammatory responses, are common among athletes during prolonged training or competition. Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory nutritional supplements are common strategies used to reduce these damages (15). Theoretically, consuming antioxidants will help inhibit ROS formation. This is because antioxidants will bind to metal ions, reduce hydrogen peroxide formation, quench the superoxide and singlet oxygen, and break the chain reaction (3, 16\u201318). This process will improve muscle recovery and performance as it helps reduce inflammatory responses, which cause muscle damages.\nNowadays, various kinds of supplementation for muscle injury, recovery and performance are available in the market. However, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned that these supplements might contain additive and dangerous substances which could cause unwanted side effects. Previous studies have shown that about 38%\u201390% of athletes or the active population consume supplements despite a lack of scientific evidence to support their effectiveness in boosting performance and recovery (19\u201321). Therefore, it is crucial to recognise effective nutritional strategies to encourage faster recovery between intense training periods at pre-season, during 1 day training sessions and between competitions during competition or tournament seasons.\nIn general, antioxidants can be obtained from fruits and vegetables containing polyphenols. Close et al. (22) stated that inflammation and oxidative damage within the muscle causes fatigue and decreased performance due to excess ROS attenuated by the consumption of fruit-derived polyphenols with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Furthermore, the daily consumption of >1000 mg polyphenols for at least 3 days prior to and following exercise or approximately 300 mg polyphenol an hour prior to exercise may ameliorate muscle perfusion, enhancing muscle recovery and performance (17). Therefore, this paper aims to summa\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This process enables the breakdown of cellular waste, which has health benefits. But the process naturally becomes less effective as the body ages. Autophagy is a possible avenue for research to \"cleanse\" neurons of their aggregates of harmful proteins in diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's. Elucidating the mechanism of autophagy raises hopes that it might be possible to stimulate the process of autophagy and perhaps one day lead to a cure for neurodegenerative diseases.\nIntermittent fasting has become a popular practice in recent years. It is known to have beneficial health effects \u2013 several studies1, 2, 3 have shown that leaving longer gaps between meals reduces the risk of heart attack, stroke and cancer.\nIntermittent fasting could even extend our lifespan. These positive effects are related to the biochemical processes induced in cells when we deprive ourselves of food. One such process, known as autophagy, is a key recycling system induced in all the body's cells when we are hungry.\nThe main function of autophagy is to break down damaged or unwanted cellular components. During autophagy, a membrane sac forms. It functions like a trash bag and collects cellular waste. The method used by cells to produce these \"trash bags\" had always remained a mystery, despite considerable research.\nBut the Membrane Biochemistry and Transport team at the Institut Pasteur has unlocked the secret.4 The scientists discovered that hungry cells produce a container composed of proteins, which forms a cup to stabilize the membrane.\nCell membranes are flexible barriers that can separate a cell's compartments. Membranes are flexible and can take on any form. In the process of autophagy, cellular \"trash bags\" are shaped like cups, which enables them to collect and contain waste. The formation of these membrane cups requires protein scaffolding, which assembles at the membrane surface. \"We identified the elements in the scaffolding and elucidated the way in which they assemble to form cellular trash bags,\" explains Jagan Mohan, a scientist in the team that made this important discovery. \"To understand the molecular mechanism behind the process, we produced the components in the cellular trash can and then assembled the scaffolding step by step on artificial membranes. This enabled us to reconstruct cellular trash bags in test tubes and to reveal the structure and function of the protein scaffolding components that form the trash can.\"\n\"Our discovery paves the way for the identification of drugs that activate autophagy and induce the formation of cellular trash bags,\" explains Thomas Wollert, who leads the research team. \"We know that autophagy is a serious avenue to explore as a way of breaking down the protein aggregates observed around neurons in neurodegenerative diseases\" \u2013 and thereby slowing down the aging process. \"Our hope is that these drugs could be used to treat patients with Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease.\" The drugs would also be useful in preventing the development of diabetes in high-risk patients.\nIn their study, the scientists refer to 16/8 intermittent fasting, which is one way of limiting food intake. The idea is to fast for 16 hours every day and only eat during an 8-hour window. But the diet only works if it is sustained permanently, so it is not recommended for certain people. Medical advice should always be sought. There are also more extreme examples of intermittent fasting, which are risky and should be avoided. These include the 5:2 diet (fasting for two days a week) or \"Eat Stop Eat\" (fasting for 24 hours once or twice a week). There are health risks5, 6 associated with these extreme practices, which can lead to nutritional deficiencies or eating disorders. They can also be associated with cult-like behavior. If you want to start intermittent fasting, you should always ask your doctor for advice.\nSources\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",
