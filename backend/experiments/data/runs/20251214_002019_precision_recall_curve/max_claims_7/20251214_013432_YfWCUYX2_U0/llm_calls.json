We look at the Earth from space and we measure it on the ground. And what we see is that the planet's climate is changing. The last years have been the warmest since modern record-keeping began. It's serious. Even a little change in temperature can have big effects. And we're seeing some of those effects now. Sea levels are rising. We're seeing more extreme events like heatwaves and heavy rainfall and wildfire. And we know that a lot of those effects are going to increase with more warming. These changes are impacting decisions that some people make every day, like a farmer thinking about what crops to grow or a homeowner thinking about flood risk. But there's hope. There are scientists at NASA and around the world that are researching this. We know more about our planet than we have ever before, and we learn more every day. So we know why climate is changing. We know that it's due to increasing greenhouse gases from human activity. We also have tools that can help us better understand and better prepare for future climate change. So we develop computer models that help us understand how much it might change in the future. And we're also developing technologies here at NASA and around the world that can help us limit future warming or respond to the warming that we're experiencing. So why does climate change matter? It's real. It's serious, and it's here. We Asked a NASA Scientist. NASA. A NASA 360 Production.",

Global temperatures last year were ...\n\nFull Page Content:\n5 MIN READ\nLee esta nota de prensa en espa\u00f1ol aqu\u00ed.\nEarth\u2019s average surface temperature in 2023 was the warmest on record, according to an analysis by NASA. Global temperatures last year were around 2.1 degrees Fahrenheit (1.2 degrees Celsius) above the average for NASA\u2019s baseline period (1951-1980), scientists from NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) in New York reported.\n\u201cNASA and NOAA\u2019s global temperature report confirms what billions of people around the world experienced last year; we are facing a climate crisis,\u201d said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. \u201cFrom extreme heat, to wildfires, to rising sea levels, we can see our Earth is changing. There\u2019s still more work to be done, but President Biden and communities across America are taking more action than ever to reduce climate risks and help communities become more resilient \u2013 and NASA will continue to use our vantage point of space to bring critical climate data back down to Earth that is understandable and accessible for all people. NASA and the Biden-Harris Administration are working to protect our home planet and its people, for this generation \u2013 and the next.\u201d\nIn 2023, hundreds of millions of people around the world experienced extreme heat, and each month from June through December set a global record for the respective month. July was the hottest month ever recorded. Overall, Earth was about 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit (or about 1.4 degrees Celsius) warmer in 2023 than the late 19th-century average, when modern record-keeping began.\n\u201cThe exceptional warming that we\u2019re experiencing is not something we\u2019ve seen before in human history,\u201d said Gavin Schmidt, director of GISS. \u201cIt\u2019s driven primarily by our fossil fuel emissions, and we\u2019re seeing the impacts in heat waves, intense rainfall, and coastal flooding.\u201d\nThough scientists have conclusive evidence that the planet\u2019s long-term warming trend is driven by human activity, they still examine other phenomena that can affect yearly or multi-year changes in climate such as El Ni\u00f1o, aerosols and pollution, and volcanic eruptions.\nTypically, the largest source of year-to-year variability is the El Ni\u00f1o \u2013 Southern Oscillation ocean climate pattern in the Pacific Ocean. The pattern has two phases \u2013 El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a \u2013 when sea surface temperatures along the equator switch between warmer, average, and cooler temperatures. From 2020-2022, the Pacific Ocean saw three consecutive La Ni\u00f1a events, which tend to cool global temperatures. In May 2023, the ocean transitioned from La Ni\u00f1a to El Ni\u00f1o, which often coincides with the hottest years on record.\nHowever, the record temperatures in the second half of 2023 occurred before the peak of the current El Ni\u00f1o event. Scientists expect to see the biggest impacts of El Ni\u00f1o in February, March, and April.\nScientists have also investigated possible impacts from the January 2022 eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha\u2019apai undersea volcano, which blasted water vapor and fine particles, or aerosols, into the stratosphere. A recent study found that the volcanic aerosols \u2013 by reflecting sunlight away from Earth\u2019s surface \u2013 led to an overall slight cooling of less than 0.2 degrees Fahrenheit (or about 0.1 degrees Celsius) in the Southern Hemisphere following the eruption.\n\u201cEven with occasional cooling factors like volcanoes or aerosols, we will continue to break records as long as greenhouse gas emissions keep going up,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cAnd, unfortunately, we just set a new record for greenhouse gas emissions again this past year.\u201d\n\u201cThe record-setting year of 2023 underscores the significance of urgent and continued actions to address climate change,\u201d said NASA Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy. \u201cRecent legislation has delivered the U.S. government\u2019s largest-ever climate investment, including billions to strengthen America\u2019s resilience to the increasing impacts of the climate crisis. As an agency focused on studying our changing climate, NASA\u2019s fleet of Earth observing satellites will continue to provide critical data of our home planet at scale to help all people make informed decisions.\u201d\nOpen Science in Action\nNASA assembles its temperature record using surface air temperature data collected from tens of thousands of meteorological stations, as well as sea surface temperature data acquired by ship- and buoy-based instruments. This data is analyzed using methods that account for the varied spacing of temperature stations around the globe and for urban heating effects that could skew the calculations.\nIndependent analyses by NOAA and the Hadley Centre (part of the United Kingdom Met Office) concluded the global surface temperatures for 2023 were the highest since modern record-keeping began. These scientists use much of the same temperature data in their analyses but use different methodologies. Although rankings can differ slightly between the records, they are in broad agreement and show the same ongoing long-term warming in recent decades.\nBuilding on a half century of research, observations, and models, the Biden-Harris Administration including NASA and several federal partners recently launched the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center to make critical climate data readily available to decisionmakers and citizens. The center supports collaboration across U.S. government agencies and the non-profit and private sectors to make air-, ground-, and space-borne data and resources available online.\nNASA\u2019s full dataset of global surface temperatures through 2023, as well as details with code of how NASA scientists conducted the analysis, are publicly available from GISS. GISS is a NASA laboratory managed by the Earth Sciences Division of the agency\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. The laboratory is affiliated with Columbia University\u2019s Earth Institute and School of Engineering and Applied Science in New York.\nFor more information on NASA, visit: https://www.nasa.gov.\n-end-\nKaren Fox / Katherine Rohloff Headquarters, Washington 202-358-1600 karen.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Plus, 3 tips for covering and localizing climate change stories.\nRepublish This Story\nWhat happens when once reliable indicators of the world\u2019s climate future suddenly seem not so dependable?\nThat\u2019s one startling puzzle from 2023, when scientists\u2019 predictions based on past observations and trends failed to warn of a huge spike in land and ocean surface temperatures. So far, in 2024, predictions for global temperatures are aligning with real world observations, suggesting last year may have been an anomaly.\nGoing into 2023, prominent climatologists gave relatively low odds that the year would be the hottest on record, which it was. The world was coming out of three years of La Ni\u00f1a, a climate pattern marked by cooler than usual temperatures in the eastern Pacific Ocean around the equator, which affects weather both in nearby South America and far away.\n\u201cDrawing on precedents when similar conditions prevailed at the beginning of a year, several climate scientists, including me, put the odds of 2023 turning out to be a record warm year at just one in five,\u201d writes Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, in a March 2024 essay in Nature.\nThe margin of warming also surprised climatologists \u2014 Earth in 2023 was about 0.2 degrees Celsius warmer than predicted, Schmidt writes in Nature.\nThe 10 warmest years on record have all happened from 2014 to 2023, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\u201cMost records are set on the order of a few hundredths of a degree, so this is a really big jump,\u201d said Russ Vose, chief of monitoring and assessment at the National Centers for Environmental Information, part of NOAA, during a media briefing earlier this year.\nAnd 2023 wasn\u2019t just the hottest year on record.\nThe summer of 2023 may have been the hottest summer in the past 2,000 years in the Northern Hemisphere, according to estimates in a May 2024 paper in Nature.\nThe best temperature measurements available today began in the U.S. and the U.K. in 1880. Climatologists use this data to extrapolate global temperatures. For earlier estimates, scientists rely on other measurements, such as tree rings, which is what the authors of the Nature paper used.\nCertain trees grow slowly during colder years and faster during warmer years, meaning the size of their rings is determined by the climate at the time.\nRoughly 90% of people live in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\u201cThe year 2023 may well come to be seen as a watershed year for the climate,\u201d writes Joy Merwin Monteiro of the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research in a May 2024 commentary in Communications Earth & Environment.\nThere are two things audiences should know about yearly warming records. The first is that humans are warming the planet, in large part by burning fossil fuels. The ongoing warming of the planet since the industrial revolution is a long-term, scientifically observed trend, and its rapid pace is caused by humans. Humans are responsible for a roughly 1 degree Celsius increase in global temperatures compared with pre-industrial levels, according to the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\u201cThere is unequivocal evidence that Earth is warming at an unprecedented rate,\u201d according to NASA. \u201cHuman activity is the principal cause.\u201d\nThe second is natural yearly climate variability \u2014 such as whether an El Ni\u00f1o or La Ni\u00f1a climate pattern is present. When the overall, long-term warming trend caused by humans coincides with natural climate patterns that tend to warm the planet, such as El Ni\u00f1o, that is usually when climatologists predict warmer-than-usual years.\nThe heat has persisted in 2024, with June 2024 marking the 13th month in a row that broke global temperature records, according to Berkeley Earth, a nonprofit climate data organization founded by Richard Muller, a professor emeritus of physics at the University of California, Berkeley.\nJuly 22 was also the hottest day on record, according to the NASA Goddard Institute. The previous single-day record was set in July 2023.\nNone of that is necessarily surprising, as the tail end of El Nino patterns tend to warm the planet going into a new year.\n\u201cThings do seem to be acting pretty much according to expectations, and the expectation is that 2024 will be a record-breaking year,\u201d Schmidt says.\nPut another way, the warmth in 2024 is something climatologists saw coming, as El Nino is a reliable driver of global temperature increases. One paper, published in February 2024 in Nature\u2019s Scientific Reports, put the odds at 90% that global surface air temperatures would beat historical records over the year spanning July 2023 to June 2024. Climate models are again meeting expectations.\n\u201cIf things are now back to \u2014 not normal, there\u2019s no normal anymore, everything is shifting \u2014 but things are back to within what we are predicting or what we expect, then it makes it look like 2023 is more blip-like,\u201d Schmidt says. \u201cWhich means that it isn\u2019t going to have a sustained systemic shift going forward, which would be good news. But the whole situation is extremely unsatisfactory and I want us to have a better understanding of what\u2019s actually going on.\u201d\nUnderstanding what happened in 2023 is important because climate change is affecting every municipality, state and country \u2014 and nearly every news beat. Here are some examples:\nAgriculture: Farmers worldwide use seasonal climate predictions to decide what to grow and when. More broadly, global warming could drastically reduce yields across the world for staple crops such as corn and wheat as soon as 2030, according to research published in Nature Food.\nEmergency response: Federal and local officials are incorporating climate change into their planning, including for ongoing sea-level rise due to melting glaciers and preparedness for more frequent and int\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

At the request of WMO Members and other United Nations entities, WCRP has developed a status brief on current and projected sea-level rise (SLR), and the related challenges that the global community of scientists are addressing, to better understand processes and reduce uncertainties. This continuing research allows WMO to improve, over time, actionable sea-level risk information for society as synthesized in the brief. In this extended version for the WMO Bulletin, we outline the current state and understanding of global sea-level rise science and provide policy relevant information for users and decision-makers.\nSLR is one of the clearest planet\u2010wide consequences of climate change. Global mean sea-level (GMSL) has risen 20 centimetres (cm) since the early 20th century. The rate of SLR is accelerating and will continue to rise under all emissions scenarios well beyond the end of the 21st century (IPCC 2023). SLR impacts coastal communities, infrastructure and ecosystems through permanent inundation of the lowest-lying areas and by increasing the frequency of flooding. Added to this are associated impacts such as erosion, groundwater inundation, and aquifer and floodplain salinization affecting wider coastal environments. Coastal hazards and their impacts are now occurring worldwide, and their near-term risks are projected to escalate well before 2050. One billion people living in coastal areas will be impacted by the end of the century (IPCC 2023) (see the box below).\nThe ability to anticipate and adapt to SLR and curtail its acceleration beyond 2050 will determine how society copes with increasing coastal risks. This ability depends on access to context-specific risk information and strategies tailored to unique local environmental, cultural and social settings, as well as near-term and ongoing commitment to emissions mitigation. There are hard limits to adaptation in the face of progressive SLR, because SLR may become irreversible this century. Coastal inundation already threatens habitability and sovereignty for some small-island developing states. Some communities, for example in Tuvalu and Fiji, are already implementing relocation or managed retreat from their coastlines or exploring new visions of a digital community (Rothe et al., 2024).\nGMSL rise depends almost equally on two main contributors, both of which are highly sensitive to ongoing climate change: the expansion of ocean waters as they warm, and meltwater contributions from ice on land \u2013 the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets as well as thousands of smaller mountain glaciers (e.g. Liang et al. 2025). Global sea-level rise is accelerating: 2024 recorded an increase of 5.9 mm, relative to a mean annual average rate of 3.4 mm/year between 1993\u20132024 and 4.7 mm/ year between 2014\u20132023, due to an accelerating rate of land ice loss and recent exceptional rates of atmospheric and ocean warming (Hamlington et al. 2025, Liang et al. 2025). Trends based on tide gauge sea-level data from 1970\u20132023, extrapolated forward to 2050, support mid-range Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projections (IPCC, 2021) of sea-level change by 2050 and highlight the value of observational constraints on model projections (Wang et al. 2025). The likely (17th\u201383rd percentile) range of global mean SLR for the end of the century for all climate scenarios is between 0.4\u20131 m (Figure 1).\nWhat are some of the consequences of sea-level rise? It is estimated that between 4 and 72 million people, with the greatest numbers in Bangladesh, India and Vietnam, but many affected elsewhere, will need to migrate between 2020 and 2100, due to a net land loss of 2 800 to 490 000 km2 (Ballesteros et al. 2025). In Bangladesh alone, it is estimated that 15 million will be displaced by 2050 (IPCC, 2019). Across the range of socioeconomic scenarios considered by IPCC AR6, the greatest estimated migration is under the \u201chigh mid-range\u201d SSP3-7.0 scenario, due to population and economic differences between the scenarios (Ballesteros et al. 2025).\nSea level will not rise evenly around the world\u2019s shorelines. While global average SLR is often quoted, the rate and magnitude of future SLR will be different in various regions depending on which polar ice sheets melt the fastest and due to the influences of mass redistribution on Earth\u2019s gravitational field, axis of rotation and the shape of the Earth\u2019s surface, as well as regional changes in ocean and atmospheric dynamics (IPCC, 2021). Examples of these regional differences in SLR include: (i) the western equatorial Pacific where rates of SLR are up to 20 mm/year due to regional ocean heating, and (ii) the US coastline, which could see up to 20% more SLR than the global average, if the West Antarctic Ice Sheet melts dramatically. Moreover, local land subsidence due to tectonics, groundwater and fluid extraction and compaction from the weight of industrialization (e.g., Ohenhen, 2023) can exacerbate the rate of SLR. Adaptation planning decision thresholds, such as those linked to the impacts of coastal flooding and inundation, may be brought forward by decades (Naish et al., 2024).\nDespite recent advances in ice-sheet modelling, deep uncertainty remains about the possible impact of accelerating ice-mass loss from the Antarctic Ice Sheets on the high-range of sea-level projections, especially beyond the 21st century, due to limitations in understanding and representing physical processes at ice margins and their feedback in the climate system (Fricker et al. 2025, Kopp et al. 2023).

NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Information.\nAccording to the annual report from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, 2024 was the warmest year since global records began in 1850. The global average surface temperature was 2.32 Fahrenheit (1.29 degrees Celsius) above the 20th-century average (57.0 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.9 degrees Celsius) and 2.63 degrees Fahrenheit (1.46 degrees Celsius) above the pre-industrial average (56.7 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.7 degrees Celsius), which NOAA defines as the period from 1850-1900.\nGlobal temperatures in 2024 were above the 1991-2020 average (red) across most of the planet. Yearly temperatures compared to the 20th-century average (bar chart) show that it has been 48 years since Earth had a cooler-than-average year. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe 2024 global temperature anomaly (anomaly means \u201cdifference from average\u201d) is 0.18 degrees F (0.10 degrees C) warmer than the previous record, set the year before, in 2023. The ten warmest years in the 175-year record have all occurred during the last decade (2015\u20132024). When the new century started in 2000, the first year to set a new high-temperature record was 2005. Now, 2005 is just the 13th-warmest year on record.\nOther 2024 rankings included...\nFor more regional details and 2024 climate statistics, see the 2024 Global Climate Report from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe global average surface temperature is an indicator of the state of Earth\u2019s energy balance: how much sunlight it absorbs minus how much heat it radiates back to space. When these amounts are the same, Earth\u2019s average surface temperature remains steady. When they are out of balance, Earth cools or warms. Earth\u2019s average surface temperature has been rising because human-produced greenhouse gases are causing Earth to absorb more energy than it radiates back to space.\nGiven the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of added heat energy to raise Earth\u2019s average surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree-Fahrenheit (1-degree-Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1850-1900 in NOAA's record) might seem small, but it represents a significant increase in heat energy circulating through all parts of the Earth system, including the oceans, frozen landscapes, and the atmosphere.\nBeyond being an indicator of changes in Earth\u2019s energy balance, surface temperature matters because it controls many environmental and ecological processes that are important to humans and other life, including the water cycle (evaporation, clouds, surface water supplies, and precipitation), the carbon cycle, and the kinds of plants, animals, and other living things that can survive in different places on Earth.\nThe concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (55 degrees Celsius) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the \"average\" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget, which can only be directly measured from space.\nTo calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute temperature readings to temperature anomalies\u2014the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend.\nAcross inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and known physical relationships\u2014such as the way temperature decreases with altitude\u2014to estimate the missing values. Each value is then used to calculate a global-scale temperature anomaly. This process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in Earth's surface temperature over time. Read more about how the global surface temperature record is built in our Climate Data Primer.\nTemperature change has not been uniform across the planet, but more areas are warming than cooling. And the rate of warming has accelerated in recent decades. According to NOAA's 2024 Annual Climate Report the combined land and ocean temperature has warmed at an average rate of 0.11 degrees Fahrenheit (0.06 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1850 and more than three times that rate (0.36 degrees Fahrenheit, or 0.20 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1975.\nRecent rates of global warming (1994-2024, bottom) are larger than the longer-term average rates (1901-2024, top). Places that have cooled are colored blue; places that have warmed are colored yellow, orange, or red. In the past three decades, many places in the Northern Hemisphere have warmed by 1 degree Fahrenheit or more per decade. Differences are most dramatic in the Arctic. With the decline of ice and snow, the Arctic reflects less incoming sunlight, which amplifies the rate of greenhouse-gas-driven warming. NOAA Climate.gov, based o\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Blue bars indicate cooler-than-average years; red bars show warmer-than-average years. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Information.\nAccording to the annual report from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, 2024 was the warmest year since global records began in 1850. The global average surface temperature was 2.32 Fahrenheit (1.29 degrees Celsius) above the 20th-century average (57.0 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.9 degrees Celsius) and 2.63 degrees Fahrenheit (1.46 degrees Celsius) above the pre-industrial average (56.7 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.7 degrees Celsius), which NOAA defines as the period from 1850-1900.\nGlobal temperatures in 2024 were above the 1991-2020 average (red) across most of the planet. Yearly temperatures compared to the 20th-century average (bar chart) show that it has been 48 years since Earth had a cooler-than-average year. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe 2024 global temperature anomaly (anomaly means \u201cdifference from average\u201d) is 0.18 degrees F (0.10 degrees C) warmer than the previous record, set the year before, in 2023. The ten warmest years in the 175-year record have all occurred during the last decade (2015\u20132024). When the new century started in 2000, the first year to set a new high-temperature record was 2005. Now, 2005 is just the 13th-warmest year on record.\nOther 2024 rankings included...\nFor more regional details and 2024 climate statistics, see the 2024 Global Climate Report from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe global average surface temperature is an indicator of the state of Earth\u2019s energy balance: how much sunlight it absorbs minus how much heat it radiates back to space. When these amounts are the same, Earth\u2019s average surface temperature remains steady. When they are out of balance, Earth cools or warms. Earth\u2019s average surface temperature has been rising because human-produced greenhouse gases are causing Earth to absorb more energy than it radiates back to space.\nGiven the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of added heat energy to raise Earth\u2019s average surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree-Fahrenheit (1-degree-Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1850-1900 in NOAA's record) might seem small, but it represents a significant increase in heat energy circulating through all parts of the Earth system, including the oceans, frozen landscapes, and the atmosphere.\nBeyond being an indicator of changes in Earth\u2019s energy balance, surface temperature matters because it controls many environmental and ecological processes that are important to humans and other life, including the water cycle (evaporation, clouds, surface water supplies, and precipitation), the carbon cycle, and the kinds of plants, animals, and other living things that can survive in different places on Earth.\nThe concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (55 degrees Celsius) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the \"average\" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget, which can only be directly measured from space.\nTo calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute temperature readings to temperature anomalies\u2014the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend.\nAcross inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and known physical relationships\u2014such as the way temperature decreases with altitude\u2014to estimate the missing values. Each value is then used to calculate a global-scale temperature anomaly. This process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in Earth's surface temperature over time. Read more about how the global surface temperature record is built in our Climate Data Primer.\nTemperature change has not been uniform across the planet, but more areas are warming than cooling. And the rate of warming has accelerated in recent decades. According to NOAA's 2024 Annual Climate Report the combined land and ocean temperature has warmed at an average rate of 0.11 degrees Fahrenheit (0.06 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1850 and more than three times that rate (0.36 degrees Fahrenheit, or 0.20 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1975.\nRecent rates of global warming (1994-2024, bottom) are larger than the longer-term average rates (1901-2024, top). Places that have cooled are colored blue; places that have warmed are colored yellow, orange, or red. In the past three decades, many places in the Northern Hemisphere have warmed by 1 degree Fahrenheit or more per decade. Differences are most dramatic in the Arctic. With the decline of ice and snow, the Arctic reflects less incoming sunlight, which amplifies the rate of greenhouse-gas-driven warming. NOAA Climate.gov, based o\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Lee, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory\nSea level rise is affecting coastal communities around the world, especially those like Honolulu, pictured, that are located on islands\nCredit: NOAA Teacher at Sea Program, NOAA Ship HI\u2019IALAKAI\nA long-term sea level dataset shows ocean surface heights continuing to rise at faster and faster rates over decades of observations.\nGlobal average sea level rose by about 0.3 inches (0.76 centimeters) from 2022 to 2023, a relatively large jump due mostly to a warming climate and the development of a strong El Ni\u00f1o. The total rise is equivalent to draining a quarter of Lake Superior into the ocean over the course of a year.\nThis NASA-led analysis is based on a sea level dataset featuring more than 30 years of satellite observations, starting with the U.S.-French TOPEX/Poseidon mission, which launched in 1992. The Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich mission, which launched in November 2020, is the latest in the series of satellites that have contributed to this sea level record.\nThe data shows that global average sea level has risen a total of about 4 inches (9.4 centimeters) since 1993. The rate of this increase has also accelerated, more than doubling from 0.07 inches (0.18 centimeters) per year in 1993 to the current rate of 0.17 inches (0.42 centimeters) per year.\n\u201cCurrent rates of acceleration mean that we are on track to add another 20 centimeters of global mean sea level by 2050, doubling the amount of change in the next three decades compared to the previous 100 years and increasing the frequency and impacts of floods across the world,\u201d said Nadya Vinogradova Shiffer, director for the NASA sea level change team and the ocean physics program in Washington.\nSeasonal Effects\nGlobal sea level saw a significant jump from 2022 to 2023 due mainly to a switch between La Ni\u00f1a and El Ni\u00f1o conditions. A mild La Ni\u00f1a from 2021 to 2022 resulted in a lower-than-expected rise in sea level that year. A strong El Ni\u00f1o developed in 2023, helping to boost the average amount of rise in sea surface height.\nLa Ni\u00f1a is characterized by cooler-than-normal ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. El Ni\u00f1o involves warmer-than-average ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific. Both periodic climate phenomena affect patterns of rainfall and snowfall as well as sea levels around the world.\n\u201cDuring La Ni\u00f1a, rain that normally falls in the ocean falls on the land instead, temporarily taking water out of the ocean and lowering sea levels,\u201d said Josh Willis, a sea level researcher at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \u201cIn El Ni\u00f1o years, a lot of the rain that normally falls on land ends up in the ocean, which raises sea levels temporarily.\u201d\nA Human Footprint\nSeasonal or periodic climate phenomena can affect global average sea level from year to year. But the underlying trend for more than three decades has been increasing ocean heights as a direct response to global warming due to the excessive heat trapped by greenhouse gases in Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\u201cLong-term datasets like this 30-year satellite record allow us to differentiate between short-term effects on sea level, like El Ni\u00f1o, and trends that let us know where sea level is heading,\u201d said Ben Hamlington, lead for NASA\u2019s sea level change team at JPL.\nThese multidecadal observations wouldn\u2019t be possible without ongoing international cooperation, as well as scientific and technical innovations by NASA and other space agencies. Specifically, radar altimeters have helped produce ever-more precise measurements of sea level around the world. To calculate ocean height, these instruments bounce microwave signals off the sea surface, recording the time the signal takes to travel from a satellite to Earth and back, as well as the strength of the return signal.\nThe researchers also periodically cross-check those sea level measurements against data from other sources. These include tide gauges, as well as satellite measurements of factors like atmospheric water vapor and Earth\u2019s gravity field that can affect the accuracy of sea level measurements. Using that information, the researchers recalibrated the 30-year dataset, resulting in updates to sea levels in some previous years. That includes a sea level rise increase of 0.08 inches (0.21 centimeters) from 2021 to 2022.\nWhen researchers combine space-based altimetry data of the oceans with more than a century of observations from surface-based sources, such as tide gauges, the information dramatically improves our understanding of how sea surface height is changing on a global scale. When these sea level measurements are combined with other information, including ocean temperature, ice loss, and land motion, scientists can decipher why and how seas are rising.\nSite Manager: Carmen Blackwood NASA Responsible Official: Doug Newman\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

At the request of WMO Members and other United Nations entities, WCRP has developed a status brief on current and projected sea-level rise (SLR), and the related challenges that the global community of scientists are addressing, to better understand processes and reduce uncertainties. This continuing research allows WMO to improve, over time, actionable sea-level risk information for society as synthesized in the brief. In this extended version for the WMO Bulletin, we outline the current state and understanding of global sea-level rise science and provide policy relevant information for users and decision-makers.\nSLR is one of the clearest planet\u2010wide consequences of climate change. Global mean sea-level (GMSL) has risen 20 centimetres (cm) since the early 20th century. The rate of SLR is accelerating and will continue to rise under all emissions scenarios well beyond the end of the 21st century (IPCC 2023). SLR impacts coastal communities, infrastructure and ecosystems through permanent inundation of the lowest-lying areas and by increasing the frequency of flooding. Added to this are associated impacts such as erosion, groundwater inundation, and aquifer and floodplain salinization affecting wider coastal environments. Coastal hazards and their impacts are now occurring worldwide, and their near-term risks are projected to escalate well before 2050. One billion people living in coastal areas will be impacted by the end of the century (IPCC 2023) (see the box below).\nThe ability to anticipate and adapt to SLR and curtail its acceleration beyond 2050 will determine how society copes with increasing coastal risks. This ability depends on access to context-specific risk information and strategies tailored to unique local environmental, cultural and social settings, as well as near-term and ongoing commitment to emissions mitigation. There are hard limits to adaptation in the face of progressive SLR, because SLR may become irreversible this century. Coastal inundation already threatens habitability and sovereignty for some small-island developing states. Some communities, for example in Tuvalu and Fiji, are already implementing relocation or managed retreat from their coastlines or exploring new visions of a digital community (Rothe et al., 2024).\nGMSL rise depends almost equally on two main contributors, both of which are highly sensitive to ongoing climate change: the expansion of ocean waters as they warm, and meltwater contributions from ice on land \u2013 the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets as well as thousands of smaller mountain glaciers (e.g. Liang et al. 2025). Global sea-level rise is accelerating: 2024 recorded an increase of 5.9 mm, relative to a mean annual average rate of 3.4 mm/year between 1993\u20132024 and 4.7 mm/ year between 2014\u20132023, due to an accelerating rate of land ice loss and recent exceptional rates of atmospheric and ocean warming (Hamlington et al. 2025, Liang et al. 2025). Trends based on tide gauge sea-level data from 1970\u20132023, extrapolated forward to 2050, support mid-range Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projections (IPCC, 2021) of sea-level change by 2050 and highlight the value of observational constraints on model projections (Wang et al. 2025). The likely (17th\u201383rd percentile) range of global mean SLR for the end of the century for all climate scenarios is between 0.4\u20131 m (Figure 1).\nWhat are some of the consequences of sea-level rise? It is estimated that between 4 and 72 million people, with the greatest numbers in Bangladesh, India and Vietnam, but many affected elsewhere, will need to migrate between 2020 and 2100, due to a net land loss of 2 800 to 490 000 km2 (Ballesteros et al. 2025). In Bangladesh alone, it is estimated that 15 million will be displaced by 2050 (IPCC, 2019). Across the range of socioeconomic scenarios considered by IPCC AR6, the greatest estimated migration is under the \u201chigh mid-range\u201d SSP3-7.0 scenario, due to population and economic differences between the scenarios (Ballesteros et al. 2025).\nSea level will not rise evenly around the world\u2019s shorelines. While global average SLR is often quoted, the rate and magnitude of future SLR will be different in various regions depending on which polar ice sheets melt the fastest and due to the influences of mass redistribution on Earth\u2019s gravitational field, axis of rotation and the shape of the Earth\u2019s surface, as well as regional changes in ocean and atmospheric dynamics (IPCC, 2021). Examples of these regional differences in SLR include: (i) the western equatorial Pacific where rates of SLR are up to 20 mm/year due to regional ocean heating, and (ii) the US coastline, which could see up to 20% more SLR than the global average, if the West Antarctic Ice Sheet melts dramatically. Moreover, local land subsidence due to tectonics, groundwater and fluid extraction and compaction from the weight of industrialization (e.g., Ohenhen, 2023) can exacerbate the rate of SLR. Adaptation planning decision thresholds, such as those linked to the impacts of coastal flooding and inundation, may be brought forward by decades (Naish et al., 2024).\nDespite recent advances in ice-sheet modelling, deep uncertainty remains about the possible impact of accelerating ice-mass loss from the Antarctic Ice Sheets on the high-range of sea-level projections, especially beyond the 21st century, due to limitations in understanding and representing physical processes at ice margins and their feedback in the climate system (Fricker et al. 2025, Kopp et al. 2023). This includes potential runaway processes such as \u201cMarine Ice Cliff Instability\u201d. Scientists are still unable to discount some low probability, but potentially catastrophic, very high-end sea-level scenarios that go well beyond the upper l\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Plus, 3 tips for covering and localizing climate change stories.\nRepublish This Story\nWhat happens when once reliable indicators of the world\u2019s climate future suddenly seem not so dependable?\nThat\u2019s one startling puzzle from 2023, when scientists\u2019 predictions based on past observations and trends failed to warn of a huge spike in land and ocean surface temperatures. So far, in 2024, predictions for global temperatures are aligning with real world observations, suggesting last year may have been an anomaly.\nGoing into 2023, prominent climatologists gave relatively low odds that the year would be the hottest on record, which it was. The world was coming out of three years of La Ni\u00f1a, a climate pattern marked by cooler than usual temperatures in the eastern Pacific Ocean around the equator, which affects weather both in nearby South America and far away.\n\u201cDrawing on precedents when similar conditions prevailed at the beginning of a year, several climate scientists, including me, put the odds of 2023 turning out to be a record warm year at just one in five,\u201d writes Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, in a March 2024 essay in Nature.\nThe margin of warming also surprised climatologists \u2014 Earth in 2023 was about 0.2 degrees Celsius warmer than predicted, Schmidt writes in Nature.\nThe 10 warmest years on record have all happened from 2014 to 2023, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\u201cMost records are set on the order of a few hundredths of a degree, so this is a really big jump,\u201d said Russ Vose, chief of monitoring and assessment at the National Centers for Environmental Information, part of NOAA, during a media briefing earlier this year.\nAnd 2023 wasn\u2019t just the hottest year on record.\nThe summer of 2023 may have been the hottest summer in the past 2,000 years in the Northern Hemisphere, according to estimates in a May 2024 paper in Nature.\nThe best temperature measurements available today began in the U.S. and the U.K. in 1880. Climatologists use this data to extrapolate global temperatures. For earlier estimates, scientists rely on other measurements, such as tree rings, which is what the authors of the Nature paper used.\nCertain trees grow slowly during colder years and faster during warmer years, meaning the size of their rings is determined by the climate at the time.\nRoughly 90% of people live in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\u201cThe year 2023 may well come to be seen as a watershed year for the climate,\u201d writes Joy Merwin Monteiro of the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research in a May 2024 commentary in Communications Earth & Environment.\nThere are two things audiences should know about yearly warming records. The first is that humans are warming the planet, in large part by burning fossil fuels. The ongoing warming of the planet since the industrial revolution is a long-term, scientifically observed trend, and its rapid pace is caused by humans. Humans are responsible for a roughly 1 degree Celsius increase in global temperatures compared with pre-industrial levels, according to the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\u201cThere is unequivocal evidence that Earth is warming at an unprecedented rate,\u201d according to NASA. \u201cHuman activity is the principal cause.\u201d\nThe second is natural yearly climate variability \u2014 such as whether an El Ni\u00f1o or La Ni\u00f1a climate pattern is present. When the overall, long-term warming trend caused by humans coincides with natural climate patterns that tend to warm the planet, such as El Ni\u00f1o, that is usually when climatologists predict warmer-than-usual years.\nThe heat has persisted in 2024, with June 2024 marking the 13th month in a row that broke global temperature records, according to Berkeley Earth, a nonprofit climate data organization founded by Richard Muller, a professor emeritus of physics at the University of California, Berkeley.\nJuly 22 was also the hottest day on record, according to the NASA Goddard Institute. The previous single-day record was set in July 2023.\nNone of that is necessarily surprising, as the tail end of El Nino patterns tend to warm the planet going into a new year.\n\u201cThings do seem to be acting pretty much according to expectations, and the expectation is that 2024 will be a record-breaking year,\u201d Schmidt says.\nPut another way, the warmth in 2024 is something climatologists saw coming, as El Nino is a reliable driver of global temperature increases. One paper, published in February 2024 in Nature\u2019s Scientific Reports, put the odds at 90% that global surface air temperatures would beat historical records over the year spanning July 2023 to June 2024. Climate models are again meeting expectations.\n\u201cIf things are now back to \u2014 not normal, there\u2019s no normal anymore, everything is shifting \u2014 but things are back to within what we are predicting or what we expect, then it makes it look like 2023 is more blip-like,\u201d Schmidt says. \u201cWhich means that it isn\u2019t going to have a sustained systemic shift going forward, which would be good news. But the whole situation is extremely unsatisfactory and I want us to have a better understanding of what\u2019s actually going on.\u201d\nUnderstanding what happened in 2023 is important because climate change is affecting every municipality, state and country \u2014 and nearly every news beat. Here are some examples:\nAgriculture: Farmers worldwide use seasonal climate predictions to decide what to grow and when. More broadly, global warming could drastically reduce yields across the world for staple crops such as corn and wheat as soon as 2030, according to research published in Nature Food.\nEmergency response: Federal and local officials are incorporating climate change into their planning, including for ongoing sea-level rise due to melting glaciers and preparedness for more frequent and int\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

As the maps show, global warming does not mean temperatures rise ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAir temperatures on Earth have been rising since the Industrial Revolution. While natural variability plays some part, the preponderance of evidence indicates that human activities\u2014particularly emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases\u2014are mostly responsible for making our planet warmer.\nAccording to an ongoing temperature analysis led by scientists at NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), the average global temperature on Earth has increased by at least 1.1\u00b0 Celsius (1.9\u00b0 Fahrenheit) since 1880. The majority of the warming has occurred since 1975, at a rate of roughly 0.15 to 0.20\u00b0C per decade.\nThe maps above show temperature anomalies in five-year increments since 1880. (Click on the arrow to run the animation.) These are not absolute temperatures, but changes from the norm for each area. The data reflect how much warmer or cooler each region was compared to a base period of 1951-1980. (The global mean surface air temperature for that period was 14\u00b0C (57\u00b0F), with an uncertainty of several tenths of a degree.)\nThe image below shows global temperature anomalies in 2022, which tied for the fifth warmest year on record. The past nine years have been the warmest years since modern recordkeeping began in 1880.\nAs the maps show, global warming does not mean temperatures rise everywhere at every time by same rate. Temperatures might rise 5 degrees in one region and drop 2 degrees in another. For instance, exceptionally cold winters in one place might be balanced by extremely warm winters in another part of the world. Generally, warming is greater over land than over the oceans because water is slower to absorb and release heat (thermal inertia). Warming may also differ substantially within specific land masses and ocean basins.\nIn the animation at the top of the page and in the bar chart below, the years from 1880 to 1939 tend to be cooler, then level off by the 1950s. Decades within the base period (1951-1980) do not appear particularly warm or cold because they are the standard against which other years are measured.\nThe leveling off of temperatures in the middle of the 20th century can be explained by natural variability and by the cooling effects of aerosols generated by factories, power plants, and motor vehicles in the years of rapid economic growth after World War II. Fossil fuel use also increased after the war (5 percent per year), boosting greenhouse gases. Cooling from aerosol pollution happened rapidly. In contrast, greenhouse gases accumulated slowly, but they remain in the atmosphere for a much longer time. According to former GISS director James Hansen, the strong warming trend of the past four decades likely reflects a shift from balanced aerosol and greenhouse gas effects on the atmosphere to a predominance of greenhouse gas effects after aerosols were curbed by pollution controls.\nWhy should we care about one or two degrees of global warming? After all, temperatures fluctuate by many degrees every day where we live.\nThe temperatures we experience locally and in short periods can fluctuate significantly due to predictable, cyclical events (night and day, summer and winter) and hard-to-predict wind and precipitation patterns. But the global temperature mainly depends on how much energy the planet receives from the Sun and how much it radiates back into space. The energy coming from the Sun fluctuates very little by year, while the amount of energy radiated by Earth is closely tied to the chemical composition of the atmosphere\u2014particularly the amount of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.\nA one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all of the oceans, the atmosphere, and the land masses by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age. A five-degree drop was enough to bury a large part of North America under a towering mass of ice 20,000 years ago.\nGlobal temperature records start around 1880 because observations did not sufficiently cover enough of the planet prior to that time. The line plot above shows yearly temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2020 as recorded by NASA, NOAA, the Berkeley Earth research group, the Met Office Hadley Centre (United Kingdom), and the Cowtan and Way analysis. Though there are minor variations from year to year, all five records show peaks and valleys in sync with each other. All show rapid warming in the past few decades, and all show the last decade as the warmest.\nThe NASA GISS team chose the period of 1951-1980 as its baseline largely because the U.S. National Weather Service uses a three-decade period to define \u201cnormal\u201d or average temperature. The GISS temperature analysis effort also began around 1980, so the most recent 30 years was 1951-1980. Their objective is to provide an estimate of temperature change that could be compared with predictions of global climate change in response to atmospheric carbon dioxide, aerosols, and changes in solar activity.\nNASA\u2019s temperature analyses incorporate surface temperature measurements from more than 20,000 weather stations, ship- and buoy-based observations of sea surface temperatures, and temperature measurements from Antarctic research stations. These in situ measurements are analyzed using an algorithm that considers the varied spacing of temperature stations around the globe and urban heat island effects.\nSubscribe to the Earth Observatory and get the Earth in your inbox.\nNASA's Earth Observatory brings you the Earth, every day, with in-depth stories and stunning imagery.\nExplore Earth Science\nEarth Science Data\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This ranks as the highest global temperature in the period of 1850\u2013 ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAir temperatures on Earth have been rising since the Industrial Revolution. While natural variability plays some part, the preponderance of evidence indicates that human activities\u2014particularly emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases\u2014are mostly responsible for making our planet warmer.\nAccording to an ongoing temperature analysis led by scientists at NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), the average global temperature on Earth has increased by at least 1.1\u00b0 Celsius (1.9\u00b0 Fahrenheit) since 1880. The majority of the warming has occurred since 1975, at a rate of roughly 0.15 to 0.20\u00b0C per decade.\nThe maps above show temperature anomalies in five-year increments since 1880. (Click on the arrow to run the animation.) These are not absolute temperatures, but changes from the norm for each area. The data reflect how much warmer or cooler each region was compared to a base period of 1951-1980. (The global mean surface air temperature for that period was 14\u00b0C (57\u00b0F), with an uncertainty of several tenths of a degree.)\nThe image below shows global temperature anomalies in 2022, which tied for the fifth warmest year on record. The past nine years have been the warmest years since modern recordkeeping began in 1880.\nAs the maps show, global warming does not mean temperatures rise everywhere at every time by same rate. Temperatures might rise 5 degrees in one region and drop 2 degrees in another. For instance, exceptionally cold winters in one place might be balanced by extremely warm winters in another part of the world. Generally, warming is greater over land than over the oceans because water is slower to absorb and release heat (thermal inertia). Warming may also differ substantially within specific land masses and ocean basins.\nIn the animation at the top of the page and in the bar chart below, the years from 1880 to 1939 tend to be cooler, then level off by the 1950s. Decades within the base period (1951-1980) do not appear particularly warm or cold because they are the standard against which other years are measured.\nThe leveling off of temperatures in the middle of the 20th century can be explained by natural variability and by the cooling effects of aerosols generated by factories, power plants, and motor vehicles in the years of rapid economic growth after World War II. Fossil fuel use also increased after the war (5 percent per year), boosting greenhouse gases. Cooling from aerosol pollution happened rapidly. In contrast, greenhouse gases accumulated slowly, but they remain in the atmosphere for a much longer time. According to former GISS director James Hansen, the strong warming trend of the past four decades likely reflects a shift from balanced aerosol and greenhouse gas effects on the atmosphere to a predominance of greenhouse gas effects after aerosols were curbed by pollution controls.\nWhy should we care about one or two degrees of global warming? After all, temperatures fluctuate by many degrees every day where we live.\nThe temperatures we experience locally and in short periods can fluctuate significantly due to predictable, cyclical events (night and day, summer and winter) and hard-to-predict wind and precipitation patterns. But the global temperature mainly depends on how much energy the planet receives from the Sun and how much it radiates back into space. The energy coming from the Sun fluctuates very little by year, while the amount of energy radiated by Earth is closely tied to the chemical composition of the atmosphere\u2014particularly the amount of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.\nA one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all of the oceans, the atmosphere, and the land masses by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age. A five-degree drop was enough to bury a large part of North America under a towering mass of ice 20,000 years ago.\nGlobal temperature records start around 1880 because observations did not sufficiently cover enough of the planet prior to that time. The line plot above shows yearly temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2020 as recorded by NASA, NOAA, the Berkeley Earth research group, the Met Office Hadley Centre (United Kingdom), and the Cowtan and Way analysis. Though there are minor variations from year to year, all five records show peaks and valleys in sync with each other. All show rapid warming in the past few decades, and all show the last decade as the warmest.\nThe NASA GISS team chose the period of 1951-1980 as its baseline largely because the U.S. National Weather Service uses a three-decade period to define \u201cnormal\u201d or average temperature. The GISS temperature analysis effort also began around 1980, so the most recent 30 years was 1951-1980. Their objective is to provide an estimate of temperature change that could be compared with predictions of global climate change in response to atmospheric carbon dioxide, aerosols, and changes in solar activity.\nNASA\u2019s temperature analyses incorporate surface temperature measurements from more than 20,000 weather stations, ship- and buoy-based observations of sea surface temperatures, and temperature measurements from Antarctic research stations. These in situ measurements are analyzed using an algorithm that considers the varied spacing of temperature stations around the globe and urban heat island effects.\nSubscribe to the Earth Observatory and get the Earth in your inbox.\nNASA's Earth Observatory brings you the Earth, every day, with in-depth stories and stunning imagery.\nExplore Earth Science\nEarth Science Data\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This value is 0.15\u00b0C (0.27\u00b0F) more than the previous record set in 2016. The 10 warmest years in the 174-year record have all occurred during the last decade (2014\u20132023). Of note, the year 2005, which was the first year to set a new global temperature record in the 21st century, is now the 12th-warmest year on record. The year 2010, which had surpassed 2005 at the time, now ranks as the 11th-warmest year on record.\nUnlike the previous two years (2021 and 2022), which were squarely entrenched in a cold phase El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) episode, also known as La Ni\u00f1a, 2023 quickly moved into ENSO neutral territory, transitioning to a warm phase episode, El Ni\u00f1o, by June. ENSO not only affects global weather patterns, but it also affects global temperatures. As seen in the image below, during the warm phase of ENSO (El Ni\u00f1o), global temperatures tend to be warmer than ENSO-neutral or La Ni\u00f1a years, while global temperatures tend to be slightly cooler during cold phase ENSO episodes (La Ni\u00f1a). Despite 2021 and 2022 not ranking among the five warmest years on record, the global annual temperature increased at an average rate of 0.06\u00b0C (0.11\u00b0F) per decade since 1850 and more than three times that rate (0.20\u00b0C / 0.36\u00b0F) since 1982.\nDuring 2023, each monthly global surface temperature anomaly value ranked among the seven warmest with June through December each ranking as the warmest such month on record. The July global temperature value was likely the warmest of all months on record and the July, August, and September temperature anomalies each exceeded 1.0\u00b0C (1.8\u00b0F) above the long-term average for the first time on record. The September anomaly value of 1.44\u00b0C (2.59\u00b0F) was the largest positive monthly global temperature anomaly for any month on record.\nGlobal ocean temperatures in 2023 were also noteworthly with nine-consecutive months (April\u2013December) of record warm temperatures. The September ocean temperature anomaly value (+1.04\u00b0C/+1.87\u00b0F) was warmest of any month on record.\nThe Northern Hemisphere summer season (June\u2013August) was warmest on record and the Northern Hemisphere autumn (September\u2013November) was not only the warmest such period on record, it exceeded the previous record from 2015 by 0.39\u00b0C (0.70\u00b0F) and was the largest positive seasonal anomaly for any season on record in the Northern Hemisphere. The 2023 Northern Hemisphere surface temperature was also warmest on record at +1.54\u00b0C (+2.77\u00b0F). Meanwhile, the Southern Hemisphere had its warmest year on record, with a temperature that was 0.82\u00b0C (1.48\u00b0F) above the 20th century average.\nThe 1901\u20132000 average combined land and ocean annual temperature is 13.9\u00b0C (57.0\u00b0F), the annually averaged land temperature for the same period is 8.5\u00b0C (47.3\u00b0F), and the long-term annually averaged sea surface temperature is 16.1\u00b0C (60.9\u00b0F).\nThe following table lists the global combined land and ocean annually averaged temperature rank and anomaly for each of the 10 warmest years on record.\nThe year was characterized by near-record warm temperatures across much of the globe, with record-high annual temperatures across parts of Canada, the southern U.S., Central America, South America, Africa, Europe, Asia, and a large portion of the central and north-eastern Atlantic as well as portions of the South Atlantic, Indian and South Pacific oceans. Meanwhile, cooler-than-average temperatures were limited to portions of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean.\nNorth America's annual temperature was 2.01\u00b0C (3.62\u00b0F) above the 1910-2000 average and was the warmest year on record. Temperatures across North America varied somewhat throughout the year. Ten of the 12 months had an above-average monthly temperature. The months of May, August, September, and December were warmest on record with July, October, and November ranking as second warmest for their respective months. August 2023 was North America's warmest month of the year with a temperature departure of +1.94\u00b0C (+3.49\u00b0F), while the largest positive temperature anomaly occurred in December (+4.88\u00b0C/8.78\u00b0F) surpassing the previous record set in 1939 by a margin of 1.39\u00b0C (2.50\u00b0F). February was North America's coldest month of the year at +0.61\u00b0C (+1.09\u00b0F). North America's yearly temperature has increased at an average rate of 0.14\u00b0C (0.23\u00b0F) per decade since 1910; however, the average rate of increase is more than double the rate (0.34\u00b0C/0.61\u00b0F) since 1982.\nSouth America's annual temperature was 1.73\u00b0C (3.11\u00b0F) above average \u2014 the warmest year since regional records began in 1910. This was South America's 47th consecutive year with temperatures above average. Nine of South America's 10 warmest years have occurred since 2012. South America's annual temperature has increased at an average rate of 0.15\u00b0C (0.27\u00b0F) per decade since 1910; however, the average rate of increase is nearly double (0.25\u00b0C/0.45\u00b0F) that value since 1982.\nSouth America had monthly temperatures that were above-average to record warm every month during 2023. Seven months (May and July through December) were record warm with each month from August to December having records that exceeded the previous record by a substantial margin (ranging from +0.32\u00b0C to +0.59\u00b0C higher than the previous record value). The month of August had the highest temperature departure of the year at +2.43\u00b0C (+4.37\u00b0F); meanwhile, January had the smallest temperature departure for the year at +0.84\u00b0C (+1.51\u00b0F).\nEurope had above-average monthly temperatures throughout the year, with the highest monthly temperature departure of +3.50\u00b0C (+6.30\u00b0F) occurring in January, resulting in the warmest January on record. In addition to January, September also ranked as the warmest such month on record surpassing the previous record set in 2020 by a margin of 1.02\u00b0C (1.84\u00b0F). The smallest monthly temperature departure for the year was +1.05\u00b0C \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This value is 0.15\u00b0C (0.27\u00b0F) more than the previous record set in 2016. The 10 warmest years in the 174-year record have all occurred during the last decade (2014\u20132023). Of note, the year 2005, which was the first year to set a new global temperature record in the 21st century, is now the 12th-warmest year on record. The year 2010, which had surpassed 2005 at the time, now ranks as the 11th-warmest year on record.\nUnlike the previous two years (2021 and 2022), which were squarely entrenched in a cold phase El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) episode, also known as La Ni\u00f1a, 2023 quickly moved into ENSO neutral territory, transitioning to a warm phase episode, El Ni\u00f1o, by June. ENSO not only affects global weather patterns, but it also affects global temperatures. As seen in the image below, during the warm phase of ENSO (El Ni\u00f1o), global temperatures tend to be warmer than ENSO-neutral or La Ni\u00f1a years, while global temperatures tend to be slightly cooler during cold phase ENSO episodes (La Ni\u00f1a). Despite 2021 and 2022 not ranking among the five warmest years on record, the global annual temperature increased at an average rate of 0.06\u00b0C (0.11\u00b0F) per decade since 1850 and more than three times that rate (0.20\u00b0C / 0.36\u00b0F) since 1982.\nDuring 2023, each monthly global surface temperature anomaly value ranked among the seven warmest with June through December each ranking as the warmest such month on record. The July global temperature value was likely the warmest of all months on record and the July, August, and September temperature anomalies each exceeded 1.0\u00b0C (1.8\u00b0F) above the long-term average for the first time on record. The September anomaly value of 1.44\u00b0C (2.59\u00b0F) was the largest positive monthly global temperature anomaly for any month on record.\nGlobal ocean temperatures in 2023 were also noteworthly with nine-consecutive months (April\u2013December) of record warm temperatures. The September ocean temperature anomaly value (+1.04\u00b0C/+1.87\u00b0F) was warmest of any month on record.\nThe Northern Hemisphere summer season (June\u2013August) was warmest on record and the Northern Hemisphere autumn (September\u2013November) was not only the warmest such period on record, it exceeded the previous record from 2015 by 0.39\u00b0C (0.70\u00b0F) and was the largest positive seasonal anomaly for any season on record in the Northern Hemisphere. The 2023 Northern Hemisphere surface temperature was also warmest on record at +1.54\u00b0C (+2.77\u00b0F). Meanwhile, the Southern Hemisphere had its warmest year on record, with a temperature that was 0.82\u00b0C (1.48\u00b0F) above the 20th century average.\nThe 1901\u20132000 average combined land and ocean annual temperature is 13.9\u00b0C (57.0\u00b0F), the annually averaged land temperature for the same period is 8.5\u00b0C (47.3\u00b0F), and the long-term annually averaged sea surface temperature is 16.1\u00b0C (60.9\u00b0F).\nThe following table lists the global combined land and ocean annually averaged temperature rank and anomaly for each of the 10 warmest years on record.\nThe year was characterized by near-record warm temperatures across much of the globe, with record-high annual temperatures across parts of Canada, the southern U.S., Central America, South America, Africa, Europe, Asia, and a large portion of the central and north-eastern Atlantic as well as portions of the South Atlantic, Indian and South Pacific oceans. Meanwhile, cooler-than-average temperatures were limited to portions of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean.\nNorth America's annual temperature was 2.01\u00b0C (3.62\u00b0F) above the 1910-2000 average and was the warmest year on record. Temperatures across North America varied somewhat throughout the year. Ten of the 12 months had an above-average monthly temperature. The months of May, August, September, and December were warmest on record with July, October, and November ranking as second warmest for their respective months. August 2023 was North America's warmest month of the year with a temperature departure of +1.94\u00b0C (+3.49\u00b0F), while the largest positive temperature anomaly occurred in December (+4.88\u00b0C/8.78\u00b0F) surpassing the previous record set in 1939 by a margin of 1.39\u00b0C (2.50\u00b0F). February was North America's coldest month of the year at +0.61\u00b0C (+1.09\u00b0F). North America's yearly temperature has increased at an average rate of 0.14\u00b0C (0.23\u00b0F) per decade since 1910; however, the average rate of increase is more than double the rate (0.34\u00b0C/0.61\u00b0F) since 1982.\nSouth America's annual temperature was 1.73\u00b0C (3.11\u00b0F) above average \u2014 the warmest year since regional records began in 1910. This was South America's 47th consecutive year with temperatures above average. Nine of South America's 10 warmest years have occurred since 2012. South America's annual temperature has increased at an average rate of 0.15\u00b0C (0.27\u00b0F) per decade since 1910; however, the average rate of increase is nearly double (0.25\u00b0C/0.45\u00b0F) that value since 1982.\nSouth America had monthly temperatures that were above-average to record warm every month during 2023. Seven months (May and July through December) were record warm with each month from August to December having records that exceeded the previous record by a substantial margin (ranging from +0.32\u00b0C to +0.59\u00b0C higher than the previous record value). The month of August had the highest temperature departure of the year at +2.43\u00b0C (+4.37\u00b0F); meanwhile, January had the smallest temperature departure for the year at +0.84\u00b0C (+1.51\u00b0F).\nEurope had above-average monthly temperatures throughout the year, with the highest monthly temperature departure of +3.50\u00b0C (+6.30\u00b0F) occurring in January, resulting in the warmest January on record. In addition to January, September also ranked as the warmest such month on record surpassing the previous record set in 2020 by a margin of 1.02\u00b0C (1.84\u00b0F).

Over the last century, burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nThe Sun serves as the primary energy source for Earth\u2019s climate. Some of the incoming sunlight is reflected directly back into space, especially by bright surfaces such as ice and clouds, and the rest is absorbed by the surface and the atmosphere. Much of this absorbed solar energy is re-emitted as heat (longwave or infrared radiation). The atmosphere in turn absorbs and re-radiates heat, some of which escapes to space. Any disturbance to this balance of incoming and outgoing energy will affect the climate. For example, small changes in the output of energy from the Sun will affect this balance directly.\nIf all heat energy emitted from the surface passed through the atmosphere directly into space, Earth\u2019s average surface temperature would be tens of degrees colder than today. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, including water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, act to make the surface much warmer than this because they absorb and emit heat energy in all directions (including downwards), keeping Earth\u2019s surface and lower atmosphere warm [Figure B1]. Without this greenhouse effect, life as we know it could not have evolved on our planet. Adding more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere makes it even more effective at preventing heat from escaping into space. When the energy leaving is less than the energy entering, Earth warms until a new balance is established.\nGreenhouse gases emitted by human activities alter Earth\u2019s energy balance and thus its climate. Humans also affect climate by changing the nature of the land surfaces (for example by clearing forests for farming) and through the emission of pollutants that affect the amount and type of particles in the atmosphere.\nScientists have determined that, when all human and natural factors are considered, Earth\u2019s climate balance has been altered towards warming, with the biggest contributor being increases in CO2.\nFigure b1. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, including water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, absorb heat energy and emit it in all directions (including downwards), keeping Earth\u2019s surface and lower atmosphere warm. Adding more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere enhances the effect, making Earth\u2019s surface and lower atmosphere even warmer. Image based on a figure from US EPA.\nThe atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide have increased significantly since the Industrial Revolution began. In the case of carbon dioxide, the average concentration measured at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii has risen from 316 parts per million (ppm) in 1959 (the first full year of data available) to more than 411 ppm in 2019 [Figure B2]. The same rates of increase have since been recorded at numerous other stations worldwide. Since preindustrial times, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 has increased by over 40%, methane has increased by more than 150%, and nitrous oxide has increased by roughly 20%. More than half of the increase in CO2 has occurred since 1970. Increases in all three gases contribute to warming of Earth, with the increase in CO2 playing the largest role. See page B3 to learn about the sources of human emitted greenhouse gases. Learn about the sources of human emitted greenhouse gases.\nScientists have examined greenhouse gases in the context of the past. Analysis of air trapped inside ice that has been accumulating over time in Antarctica shows that the CO2 concentration began to increase significantly in the 19th century [Figure B3], after staying in the range of 260 to 280 ppm for the previous 10,000 years. Ice core records extending back 800,000 years show that during that time, CO2 concentrations remained within the range of 170 to 300 ppm throughout many \u201cice age\u201d cycles - learn about the ice ages - and no concentration above 300 ppm is seen in ice core records until the past 200 years.\nMeasurements of the forms (isotopes) of carbon in the modern atmosphere show a clear fingerprint of the addition of \u201cold\u201d carbon (depleted in natural radioactive 14C) coming from the combustion of fossil fuels (as opposed to \u201cnewer\u201d carbon coming from living systems). In addition, it is known that human activities (excluding land use changes) currently emit an estimated 10 billion tonnes of carbon each year, mostly by burning fossil fuels, which is more than enough to explain the observed increase in concentration. These and other lines of evidence point conclusively to the fact that the elevated CO2 concentration in our atmosphere is the result of human activities.\nFig b2. Measurements of atmospheric CO2 since 1958 from the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii (black) and from the South Pole (red) show a steady annual increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration. The measurements are made at remote places like these because they are not greatly influenced by local processes, so therefore they are representative of the background atmosphere. The small up-and-down saw-tooth pattern reflects seasonal changes in the release and uptake of CO2 by plants. Source: Scripps CO2 Program\nFigure b3. CO2 variations during the past 1,000 years, obtained from analysis of air trapped in an ice core extracted from Antarctica (red squares), show a sharp rise in atmospheric CO2 starting in the late 19th century. Modern atmospheric measurements from Mauna Loa are superimposed in gray. Source: figure by Eric Wolff, data from Etheridge et al., 1996; MacFarling Meure et al., 2006; Scripps CO2 Program.\nEstimating global average surface air temperature increase requires careful analysis of millions of measurements from around the world, including from land stations, ships, and satellites. Despite the many complications of synthesising such data, multiple independent teams have concluded separately and unanimously that global average surface air temperature has risen by about 1 \u00b0C (1.8 \u00b0F) since 1900 [Figure B4].

And the likelihood of reaching such temperatures will continue to rise as the world warms, it said.\nAround the world, climate change has made countless heatwaves much more likely and more intense, the WWA says.\nExamples include 48C temperatures in Mali in April 2024 and prolonged, widespread heat in Scandinavia in July 2025, with temperatures regularly passing 30C in Norway.\nHeatwaves can happen as a result of heat domes, which are created when an area of high pressure stays over the same area for days or weeks, trapping hot air underneath.\nOne theory suggests that higher temperatures in the Arctic - which has warmed nearly four times faster than the global average - are affecting the fast band of winds high in the atmosphere known as the jet stream.\nThat could be making heat domes more likely, although this is not clear cut.\nFor every 1C rise in air temperature, the atmosphere can hold about 7% more moisture.\nWith more moisture available, rainfall can become heavier.\nBetween October 2023 and March 2024, the UK experienced the second-wettest such period on record.\nThis level of rainfall was made at least four times as likely by human-caused warming, according to the WWA.\nIn September 2024, deadly floods hit much of central Europe, including Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, Austria and Italy.\nThe intensity of the rainfall over four days in mid-September was made twice as likely by climate change, the WWA says.\nGlobally, heavy rainfall events have become more frequent and intense over most land regions due to human activity, according to the UN's climate body, the IPCC\nIt says this pattern will continue with further warming.\nVarious factors affect whether such heavy rainfall leads to flooding, including the quality of flood defences and drainage systems.\nLinking climate change with specific individual droughts can be difficult, because there are lots of different factors that affect the availability of water.\nNatural weather systems, for example, can play a key role, as was the case with drought in southern Africa in early 2024.\nBut climate change is shifting global rainfall patterns. While some of the world is getting wetter, other parts are becoming drier, which can make them more prone to drought.\nAnd heatwaves fuelled by climate change can worsen dry conditions when they do occur, by increasing evaporation from the soil.\nThis makes the air above warm up more quickly, leading to more intense heat.\nDuring periods of hot weather, increased demand for water, especially from farmers, puts even more stress on the water supply.\nIn parts of East Africa, there were five failed rainy seasons in a row between 2020 and 2022, as the region suffered its worst drought for 40 years. This displaced 1.2 million people in Somalia alone.\nClimate change has made droughts like this at least 100 times more likely, according to the WWA.\nHuman-caused warming was also the main driver of drought in the Amazon rainforest in the second half of 2023, the WWA found. This was the region's worst drought since modern records began.\nFires happen naturally in many parts of the world.\nIt is difficult to know if climate change has caused or worsened a specific wildfire because other factors are also relevant, such as changes to the way land is used.\nBut climate change is making the weather conditions needed for wildfires to spread more likely, the IPCC says.\nExtreme, long-lasting heat draws more moisture out of soils and vegetation.\nThese tinder-dry conditions provide fuel for fires, which can spread at an incredible speed, particularly if winds are strong.\nThe north-east Amazon experienced an extreme fire season in early 2024. Climate change made the weather conditions that helped the fires to spread between 30 and 70 times more likely, according to a report on the state of global wildfires.\nThat meant the burned area was about four times greater than if humans hadn't heated up the planet, the scientists found.\nMeanwhile, the burned area in the Southern California fires of January 2025 was about 25 times larger due to climate change, they estimated, although there are large uncertainties in the precise figures.\nMany fires are started deliberately or accidentally by humans. But rising temperatures may also increase the likelihood of lightning in the world's northernmost forests, which can in turn trigger more fires.\nThe combined effects of shifting land use and climate change mean extreme wildfires are projected to become more frequent and intense globally, according to the UN Environment Programme (UNEP).\nThe number of the most extreme fires may rise by up to 50% by 2100, UNEP suggests.\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

While natural variability plays some part, the preponderance of evidence indicates that human activities\u2014particularly emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases\u2014are mostly responsible for making our planet warmer.\nAccording to an ongoing temperature analysis led by scientists at NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), the average global temperature on Earth has increased by at least 1.1\u00b0 Celsius (1.9\u00b0 Fahrenheit) since 1880. The majority of the warming has occurred since 1975, at a rate of roughly 0.15 to 0.20\u00b0C per decade.\nThe maps above show temperature anomalies in five-year increments since 1880. (Click on the arrow to run the animation.) These are not absolute temperatures, but changes from the norm for each area. The data reflect how much warmer or cooler each region was compared to a base period of 1951-1980. (The global mean surface air temperature for that period was 14\u00b0C (57\u00b0F), with an uncertainty of several tenths of a degree.)\nThe image below shows global temperature anomalies in 2022, which tied for the fifth warmest year on record. The past nine years have been the warmest years since modern recordkeeping began in 1880.\nAs the maps show, global warming does not mean temperatures rise everywhere at every time by same rate. Temperatures might rise 5 degrees in one region and drop 2 degrees in another. For instance, exceptionally cold winters in one place might be balanced by extremely warm winters in another part of the world. Generally, warming is greater over land than over the oceans because water is slower to absorb and release heat (thermal inertia). Warming may also differ substantially within specific land masses and ocean basins.\nIn the animation at the top of the page and in the bar chart below, the years from 1880 to 1939 tend to be cooler, then level off by the 1950s. Decades within the base period (1951-1980) do not appear particularly warm or cold because they are the standard against which other years are measured.\nThe leveling off of temperatures in the middle of the 20th century can be explained by natural variability and by the cooling effects of aerosols generated by factories, power plants, and motor vehicles in the years of rapid economic growth after World War II. Fossil fuel use also increased after the war (5 percent per year), boosting greenhouse gases. Cooling from aerosol pollution happened rapidly. In contrast, greenhouse gases accumulated slowly, but they remain in the atmosphere for a much longer time. According to former GISS director James Hansen, the strong warming trend of the past four decades likely reflects a shift from balanced aerosol and greenhouse gas effects on the atmosphere to a predominance of greenhouse gas effects after aerosols were curbed by pollution controls.\nWhy should we care about one or two degrees of global warming? After all, temperatures fluctuate by many degrees every day where we live.\nThe temperatures we experience locally and in short periods can fluctuate significantly due to predictable, cyclical events (night and day, summer and winter) and hard-to-predict wind and precipitation patterns. But the global temperature mainly depends on how much energy the planet receives from the Sun and how much it radiates back into space. The energy coming from the Sun fluctuates very little by year, while the amount of energy radiated by Earth is closely tied to the chemical composition of the atmosphere\u2014particularly the amount of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.\nA one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all of the oceans, the atmosphere, and the land masses by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age. A five-degree drop was enough to bury a large part of North America under a towering mass of ice 20,000 years ago.\nGlobal temperature records start around 1880 because observations did not sufficiently cover enough of the planet prior to that time. The line plot above shows yearly temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2020 as recorded by NASA, NOAA, the Berkeley Earth research group, the Met Office Hadley Centre (United Kingdom), and the Cowtan and Way analysis. Though there are minor variations from year to year, all five records show peaks and valleys in sync with each other. All show rapid warming in the past few decades, and all show the last decade as the warmest.\nThe NASA GISS team chose the period of 1951-1980 as its baseline largely because the U.S. National Weather Service uses a three-decade period to define \u201cnormal\u201d or average temperature. The GISS temperature analysis effort also began around 1980, so the most recent 30 years was 1951-1980. Their objective is to provide an estimate of temperature change that could be compared with predictions of global climate change in response to atmospheric carbon dioxide, aerosols, and changes in solar activity.\nNASA\u2019s temperature analyses incorporate surface temperature measurements from more than 20,000 weather stations, ship- and buoy-based observations of sea surface temperatures, and temperature measurements from Antarctic research stations. These in situ measurements are analyzed using an algorithm that considers the varied spacing of temperature stations around the globe and urban heat island effects.\nSubscribe to the Earth Observatory and get the Earth in your inbox.\nNASA's Earth Observatory brings you the Earth, every day, with in-depth stories and stunning imagery.\nExplore Earth Science\nEarth Science Data\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Some of the incoming sunlight is reflected directly back into space, especially by bright surfaces such as ice and clouds, and the rest is absorbed by the surface and the atmosphere. Much of this absorbed solar energy is re-emitted as heat (longwave or infrared radiation). The atmosphere in turn absorbs and re-radiates heat, some of which escapes to space. Any disturbance to this balance of incoming and outgoing energy will affect the climate. For example, small changes in the output of energy from the Sun will affect this balance directly.\nIf all heat energy emitted from the surface passed through the atmosphere directly into space, Earth\u2019s average surface temperature would be tens of degrees colder than today. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, including water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, act to make the surface much warmer than this because they absorb and emit heat energy in all directions (including downwards), keeping Earth\u2019s surface and lower atmosphere warm [Figure B1]. Without this greenhouse effect, life as we know it could not have evolved on our planet. Adding more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere makes it even more effective at preventing heat from escaping into space. When the energy leaving is less than the energy entering, Earth warms until a new balance is established.\nGreenhouse gases emitted by human activities alter Earth\u2019s energy balance and thus its climate. Humans also affect climate by changing the nature of the land surfaces (for example by clearing forests for farming) and through the emission of pollutants that affect the amount and type of particles in the atmosphere.\nScientists have determined that, when all human and natural factors are considered, Earth\u2019s climate balance has been altered towards warming, with the biggest contributor being increases in CO2.\nFigure b1. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, including water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, absorb heat energy and emit it in all directions (including downwards), keeping Earth\u2019s surface and lower atmosphere warm. Adding more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere enhances the effect, making Earth\u2019s surface and lower atmosphere even warmer. Image based on a figure from US EPA.\nThe atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide have increased significantly since the Industrial Revolution began. In the case of carbon dioxide, the average concentration measured at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii has risen from 316 parts per million (ppm) in 1959 (the first full year of data available) to more than 411 ppm in 2019 [Figure B2]. The same rates of increase have since been recorded at numerous other stations worldwide. Since preindustrial times, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 has increased by over 40%, methane has increased by more than 150%, and nitrous oxide has increased by roughly 20%. More than half of the increase in CO2 has occurred since 1970. Increases in all three gases contribute to warming of Earth, with the increase in CO2 playing the largest role. See page B3 to learn about the sources of human emitted greenhouse gases. Learn about the sources of human emitted greenhouse gases.\nScientists have examined greenhouse gases in the context of the past. Analysis of air trapped inside ice that has been accumulating over time in Antarctica shows that the CO2 concentration began to increase significantly in the 19th century [Figure B3], after staying in the range of 260 to 280 ppm for the previous 10,000 years. Ice core records extending back 800,000 years show that during that time, CO2 concentrations remained within the range of 170 to 300 ppm throughout many \u201cice age\u201d cycles - learn about the ice ages - and no concentration above 300 ppm is seen in ice core records until the past 200 years.\nMeasurements of the forms (isotopes) of carbon in the modern atmosphere show a clear fingerprint of the addition of \u201cold\u201d carbon (depleted in natural radioactive 14C) coming from the combustion of fossil fuels (as opposed to \u201cnewer\u201d carbon coming from living systems). In addition, it is known that human activities (excluding land use changes) currently emit an estimated 10 billion tonnes of carbon each year, mostly by burning fossil fuels, which is more than enough to explain the observed increase in concentration. These and other lines of evidence point conclusively to the fact that the elevated CO2 concentration in our atmosphere is the result of human activities.\nFig b2. Measurements of atmospheric CO2 since 1958 from the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii (black) and from the South Pole (red) show a steady annual increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration. The measurements are made at remote places like these because they are not greatly influenced by local processes, so therefore they are representative of the background atmosphere. The small up-and-down saw-tooth pattern reflects seasonal changes in the release and uptake of CO2 by plants. Source: Scripps CO2 Program\nFigure b3. CO2 variations during the past 1,000 years, obtained from analysis of air trapped in an ice core extracted from Antarctica (red squares), show a sharp rise in atmospheric CO2 starting in the late 19th century. Modern atmospheric measurements from Mauna Loa are superimposed in gray.

Despite the many complications of synthesising such data, multiple independent teams have concluded separately and unanimously that global average surface air temperature has risen by about 1 \u00b0C (1.8 \u00b0F) since 1900 [Figure B4].

This could lead someone to believe a deep-learning model makes more accurate predictions when that is not the case.\nThe researchers developed a more robust way of evaluating these techniques, which shows that, while simple models are more accurate when estimating regional surface temperatures, deep-learning approaches can be the best choice for estimating local rainfall.\nThey used these results to enhance a simulation tool known as a climate emulator, which can rapidly simulate the effect of human activities onto a future climate.\nThe researchers see their work as a \u201ccautionary tale\u201d about the risk of deploying large AI models for climate science. While deep-learning models have shown incredible success in domains such as natural language, climate science contains a proven set of physical laws and approximations, and the challenge becomes how to incorporate those into AI models.\n\u201cWe are trying to develop models that are going to be useful and relevant for the kinds of things that decision-makers need going forward when making climate policy choices. While it might be attractive to use the latest, big-picture machine-learning model on a climate problem, what this study shows is that stepping back and really thinking about the problem fundamentals is important and useful,\u201d says study senior author Noelle Selin, a professor in the MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS) and the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS), and director of the Center for Sustainability Science and Strategy.\nSelin\u2019s co-authors are lead author Bj\u00f6rn L\u00fctjens, a former EAPS postdoc who is now a research scientist at IBM Research; senior author Raffaele Ferrari, the Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Oceanography in EAPS and co-director of the Lorenz Center; and Duncan Watson-Parris, assistant professor at the University of California at San Diego. Selin and Ferrari are also co-principal investigators of the Bringing Computation to the Climate Challenge project, out of which this research emerged. The paper appears today in the Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems.\nComparing emulators\nBecause the Earth\u2019s climate is so complex, running a state-of-the-art climate model to predict how pollution levels will impact environmental factors like temperature can take weeks on the world\u2019s most powerful supercomputers.\nScientists often create climate emulators, simpler approximations of a state-of-the art climate model, which are faster and more accessible. A policymaker could use a climate emulator to see how alternative assumptions on greenhouse gas emissions would affect future temperatures, helping them develop regulations.\nBut an emulator isn\u2019t very useful if it makes inaccurate predictions about the local impacts of climate change. While deep learning has become increasingly popular for emulation, few studies have explored whether these models perform better than tried-and-true approaches.\nThe MIT researchers performed such a study. They compared a traditional technique called linear pattern scaling (LPS) with a deep-learning model using a common benchmark dataset for evaluating climate emulators.\nTheir results showed that LPS outperformed deep-learning models on predicting nearly all parameters they tested, including temperature and precipitation.\n\u201cLarge AI methods are very appealing to scientists, but they rarely solve a completely new problem, so implementing an existing solution first is necessary to find out whether the complex machine-learning approach actually improves upon it,\u201d says L\u00fctjens.\nSome initial results seemed to fly in the face of the researchers\u2019 domain knowledge. The powerful deep-learning model should have been more accurate when making predictions about precipitation, since those data don\u2019t follow a linear pattern.\nThey found that the high amount of natural variability in climate model runs can cause the deep learning model to perform poorly on unpredictable long-term oscillations, like El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a. This skews the benchmarking scores in favor of LPS, which averages out those oscillations.\nConstructing a new evaluation\nFrom there, the researchers constructed a new evaluation with more data that address natural climate variability. With this new evaluation, the deep-learning model performed slightly better than LPS for local precipitation, but LPS was still more accurate for temperature predictions.\n\u201cIt is important to use the modeling tool that is right for the problem, but in order to do that you also have to set up the problem the right way in the first place,\u201d Selin says.\nBased on these results, the researchers incorporated LPS into a climate emulation platform to predict local temperature changes in different emission scenarios.\n\u201cWe are not advocating that LPS should always be the goal. It still has limitations. For instance, LPS doesn\u2019t predict variability or extreme weather events,\u201d Ferrari adds.\nRather, they hope their results emphasize the need to develop better benchmarking techniques, which could provide a fuller picture of which climate emulation technique is best suited for a particular situation.\n\u201cWith an improved climate emulation benchmark, we could use more complex machine-learning methods to explore problems that are currently very hard to address, like the impacts of aerosols or estimations of extreme precipitation,\u201d L\u00fct\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Each of the thousands of 3-dimensional grid cells can be represented by mathematical equations that describe the materials in it and the way energy moves through it. The advanced equations are based on the fundamental laws of physics, fluid motion, and chemistry. To \"run\" a model, scientists specify the climate forcing (for instance, setting variables to represent the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere) and have powerful computers solve the equations in each cell. Results from each grid cell are passed to neighboring cells, and the equations are solved again. Repeating the process through many time steps represents the passage of time. Image source: NOAA.\nClimate models are based on well-documented physical processes to simulate the transfer of energy and materials through the climate system. Climate models, also known as general circulation models or GCMs, use mathematical equations to characterize how energy and matter interact in different parts of the ocean, atmosphere, land. Building and running a climate model is complex process of identifying and quantifying Earth system processes, representing them with mathematical equations, setting variables to represent initial conditions and subsequent changes in climate forcing, and repeatedly solving the equations using powerful supercomputers.\nCheck out The Very, Very Simple Climate Model \u00bb\nClimate models separate Earth\u2019s surface into a three-dimensional grid of cells. The results of processes modeled in each cell are passed to neighboring cells to model the exchange of matter and energy over time. Grid cell size defines the resolution of the model: the smaller the size of the grid cells, the higher the level of detail in the model. More detailed models have more grid cells, so they need more computing power.\nSee an animation showing different grid sizes \u00bb\nExplore practical information for those interested in participating in global climate model experiments \u00bb\nClimate models also include the element of time, called a time step. Time steps can be in minutes, hours, days, or years. Like grid cell size, the smaller the time step, the more detailed the results will be. However, this higher temporal resolution requires additional computing power.\nOnce a climate model is set up, it can be tested via a process known as \u201chind-casting.\u201d The model is initialized to known conditions at a time in the past: many models focus on the pre-industrial conditions present in 1850. The model run begins, and inputs of historical solar intensity, volcanic activity, and greenhouse gas levels update the model environment to reflect actual conditions at each time step. The model results are then compared with observed conditions to see how well they match. This testing allows scientists to check the accuracy of the models and address areas that need improvement. Science teams around the world regularly test and compare their model outputs to observations and results from other models.\nYou can learn more about how climate models are tested and tuned in a paper from the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society (BAMS), The Art and Science of Model Tuning \u00bb\nOnce a climate model can perform well in hind-casting tests, its results for simulating future climate are also assumed to be valid. To project climate into the future, the climate forcing is set to change according to a possible future scenario. Scenarios are possible stories about how quickly human population will grow, how land will be used, how economies will evolve, and the atmospheric conditions (and therefore, climate forcing) that would result for each storyline.\nIn 2000, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued its Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES), describing four scenario families to describe a range of possible future conditions. Referred to by letter-number combinations such as A1, A2, B1, and B2, each scenario was based on a complex relationship between the socioeconomic forces driving greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions and the levels to which those emissions would climb during the 21st century. The SRES scenarios have been in use for more than a decade, so many climate model results describe their inputs using the letter-number combinations.\nIn 2013, climate scientists agreed upon a new set of scenarios that focused on the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere in 2100. Collectively, these scenarios are known as Representative Concentration Pathways or RCPs. Each RCP indicates the amount of climate forcing, expressed in Watts per square meter, that would result from greenhouse gases in the atmosphere in 2100. The rate and trajectory of the forcing is the pathway. Like their predecessors, these values are used in setting up climate models.\nLearn more about RCPs \u00bb\nAround the world, different teams of scientists have built and run models to project future climate conditions under various scenarios for the next century. So the groups can make a fair comparison of their results, they run the same experiment. Because each climate model is slightly different, the results show a range of projections. Though yearly values projected for temperature and precipitation differ among the models, the trend and magnitude of change is fairly consistent.\nGlobal climate model results from groups around the world project that global temperature will continue to increase.

The model run begins, and inputs of historical solar intensity, volcanic activity, and greenhouse gas levels update the model environment to reflect actual conditions at each time step. The model results are then compared with observed conditions to see how well they match. This testing allows scientists to check the accuracy of the models and address areas that need improvement. Science teams around the world regularly test and compare their model outputs to observations and results from other models.\nYou can learn more about how climate models are tested and tuned in a paper from the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society (BAMS), The Art and Science of Model Tuning \u00bb\nOnce a climate model can perform well in hind-casting tests, its results for simulating future climate are also assumed to be valid. To project climate into the future, the climate forcing is set to change according to a possible future scenario. Scenarios are possible stories about how quickly human population will grow, how land will be used, how economies will evolve, and the atmospheric conditions (and therefore, climate forcing) that would result for each storyline.\nIn 2000, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued its Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES), describing four scenario families to describe a range of possible future conditions. Referred to by letter-number combinations such as A1, A2, B1, and B2, each scenario was based on a complex relationship between the socioeconomic forces driving greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions and the levels to which those emissions would climb during the 21st century. The SRES scenarios have been in use for more than a decade, so many climate model results describe their inputs using the letter-number combinations.\nIn 2013, climate scientists agreed upon a new set of scenarios that focused on the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere in 2100. Collectively, these scenarios are known as Representative Concentration Pathways or RCPs. Each RCP indicates the amount of climate forcing, expressed in Watts per square meter, that would result from greenhouse gases in the atmosphere in 2100. The rate and trajectory of the forcing is the pathway. Like their predecessors, these values are used in setting up climate models.\nLearn more about RCPs \u00bb\nAround the world, different teams of scientists have built and run models to project future climate conditions under various scenarios for the next century. So the groups can make a fair comparison of their results, they run the same experiment. Because each climate model is slightly different, the results show a range of projections. Though yearly values projected for temperature and precipitation differ among the models, the trend and magnitude of change is fairly consistent.\nGlobal climate model results from groups around the world project that global temperature will continue to increase.

Rarely do we think about simulations.\n\u2014\nComputational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a branch of science that uses the physics of fluids (like water, air, fuel, flames etc.), mathematics and computer science to create accurate real-life simulations.\nCFD aids researchers in simulating everything from droplets to complex ocean currents and atmospheric turbulence. It is a powerful tool that plays a vital role in understanding and predicting the behavior of complex natural systems and extreme weather events.\nThe Earth\u2019s climate represents a massive complex fluid dynamics problem. For example, as shown in Figure 1, air flow over Canary Island generates a swirling vortex called the von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortex street, a phenomenon also seen in classic fluid dynamics scenarios such as flow past a cylinder.\nEvery climate event, from air and ocean currents to rainfall, hurricanes, tornadoes, and heatwaves, involves the movement of fluid (air, water, droplets, humidity). By using the equations governed by fluid flow, CFD can simulate these natural phenomena accurately with the help of high performance computers and mathematics. For instance, the MIT General Circulation Model (Figure 2) is used to study ocean currents and heat transport, helping us understand long-term ocean trends.\nOther models and simulations from these models help researchers understand how heat and moisture are transported in the atmosphere, predict how oceans circulate heat across the planet, simulate the formation and path of hurricanes or cyclones as well as model the impact of melting ice sheets and rising sea levels.\nImplementing renewable energy infrastructure like wind farms, tidal power stations, or other clean sources like nuclear requires costly and energy-intensive physical testing. This, in turn, can generate carbon emissions and material waste, partly offsetting the environmental benefits associated with these technologies.\nSimulations offer a sustainable alternative and help engineers design, optimize, and implement clean energy technologies with far less environmental impact. For instance, as shown in Figure 3, CFD simulations can be used to optimize turbine blade shapes or determine the most efficient layout of turbines across wind farms to reduce wake loss and maximize energy output. Similar approaches are used to model cooling systems in solar farms or simulate flow dynamics in tidal and nuclear energy systems.\nThese digital experiments are not only faster and more cost-effective but also significantly reduce carbon footprint and material waste.\nMore on the topic: Air Flow Design Is the Quiet Champion of Climate Resilience\nEarth\u2019s water resources have constantly been polluted by industrial waste, sewage discharge, littering, and agricultural runoff. Accidental or not, oil spills pose a great threat to the environment and marine eco-systems, as seen in disasters like the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill \u2013 the largest marine oil spill in history.\nCFD is used to study how oil spreads in the ocean. These simulations help predict how oil moves through water, how it breaks apart, and how it interacts with wind, waves, and currents.\nFor example, the ADIOS model developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) uses such simulations to estimate how oil might behave under different conditions. Various other computational tools have also been used to simulate how oil rises from deep-sea blowouts and travels through the ocean. These tools help emergency teams respond faster by showing where the oil will go and how to contain it without needing to run expensive or polluting physical tests.\nThis technology allows us not only to better prepare for oil spill emergencies but also to improve laws and safety regulations.\nThe examples discussed above are just the tip of the iceberg. There are many more ways computer simulations, including CFD, are helping us tackle climate change. Of course, building these high-fidelity simulations comes with its own challenges.\nRunning simulations requires computing power, which consumes energy and contributes to carbon emissions. However, the environmental cost of simulations is only a small fraction compared to that of full-scale physical experiments\nThe world of computational science is evolving rapidly. New algorithms and numerical techniques are constantly improving simulation efficiency, reducing both time and energy requirements. Moreover, more data centers are transitioning to renewable energy and are being cooled effectively. From liquid cooling systems to hybrid designs, these advancements significantly lower the carbon footprint of large-scale simulations.\nAs the climate crisis deepens, the need to act swiftly and smartly grows. CFD doesn\u2019t just help us predict the future, it allows us to design better solutions, reduce waste, and avoid environmental damage before it begins. It lets us simulate the world we want to build and the ones we hope to avoid.\nFeatured image: Allison Nussbaum/NASA Earth Observatory.\nOur non-profit newsroom provides climate coverage free of charge and advertising.

They also allow us to test theories and solutions. From models as simple as toy cars and kitchens to complex representations such as flight simulators and virtual globes, we use models throughout our lives to explore and understand how things work.\nThis image shows the concept used in climate models. Each of the thousands of 3-dimensional grid cells can be represented by mathematical equations that describe the materials in it and the way energy moves through it. The advanced equations are based on the fundamental laws of physics, fluid motion, and chemistry. To \"run\" a model, scientists specify the climate forcing (for instance, setting variables to represent the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere) and have powerful computers solve the equations in each cell. Results from each grid cell are passed to neighboring cells, and the equations are solved again. Repeating the process through many time steps represents the passage of time. Image source: NOAA.\nClimate models are based on well-documented physical processes to simulate the transfer of energy and materials through the climate system. Climate models, also known as general circulation models or GCMs, use mathematical equations to characterize how energy and matter interact in different parts of the ocean, atmosphere, land. Building and running a climate model is complex process of identifying and quantifying Earth system processes, representing them with mathematical equations, setting variables to represent initial conditions and subsequent changes in climate forcing, and repeatedly solving the equations using powerful supercomputers.\nCheck out The Very, Very Simple Climate Model \u00bb\nClimate models separate Earth\u2019s surface into a three-dimensional grid of cells. The results of processes modeled in each cell are passed to neighboring cells to model the exchange of matter and energy over time. Grid cell size defines the resolution of the model: the smaller the size of the grid cells, the higher the level of detail in the model. More detailed models have more grid cells, so they need more computing power.\nSee an animation showing different grid sizes \u00bb\nExplore practical information for those interested in participating in global climate model experiments \u00bb\nClimate models also include the element of time, called a time step. Time steps can be in minutes, hours, days, or years. Like grid cell size, the smaller the time step, the more detailed the results will be.

The Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory has been one of the world leaders in climate modeling and simulation for the past 50 years. Beginning in the 1960s, GFDL scientists developed the first coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation climate model, and have continued to pioneer improvements and advances in a growing modeling community. State-of-the art climate modeling at GFDL requires vast computational resources, including supercomputers with thousands of processors and petabytes of data storage.\nA global climate model (GCM) is a complex mathematical representation of the major climate system components (atmosphere, land surface, ocean, and sea ice), and their interactions. Earth\u2019s energy balance between the four components is the key to long-term climate prediction. The main climate system components treated in a climate model are:\nClimate models divide the globe into a three-dimensional grid of cells representing specific geographic locations and elevations. Each of the components (atmosphere, land surface, ocean, and sea ice) has equations calculated on the global grid for a set of climate variables such as temperature. In addition to model components computing how they are changing over time, the different parts exchange fluxes of heat, water, and momentum. They interact with one another as a coupled system.\nGrid size is dependent upon the power of the computer that is available to solve these equations. Finer resolution implies a larger number of grid cells and requires a bigger and faster computer to perform the simulation. Similarly, if grid spacing is farther apart, there are fewer points that are calculated, but the results are also less detailed. Once the simulated time rate of change is computed (for example, how fast each particular grid cell is warming or cooling) that rate is assumed to hold for some length of time, and the updated values are computed at each grid point according to the previous values and trends. Then, calculations start over again for the next time interval.\nThere are two types of processes within climate models that are used today: simulated and parameterized. Simulated processes are larger than grid-scale and based on bedrock scientific principles (conservation of energy, mass, and momentum). An example of a simulated process is one that represents tropical cyclones and storm activity. Parameterized processes represent more complex processes that are smaller than grid scale (so, cannot be physically represented) using simpler processes. Their formulations are guided by fundamental physical principles, but also make use of observational data. An example of a parameterized process is one that represents cloud and aerosol composition.\nGCMs are critical tools that enable us to improve the understanding and prediction of atmosphere, ocean, and climate behavior. Models allow us to determine the distinct influence of different climate features by providing a way of exploring climate sensitivities with experiments that cannot be performed on the actual earth. Changes can be made to one feature in a climate model, such as warming or cooling ocean surface temperatures, to discern the impact those changes have on the climate. The uses for climate modeling also include diagnosis and prognosis. An example of a diagnostic use is detection and attribution. Detection and attribution require first demonstrating that a detected change is statistically significant, and then attributing this change to unnatural causes such as the role of anthropogenic forcing in 20th century climate change. Prognostic climate modeling predicts future climate, such as global warming trends, using current or historic data (ocean structure, radiative forcing, etc) as a basis. Timescales for projection include seasonal/interannual variability, decadal prediction, and 21st century scenarios.\nAlthough there is some level of disagreement among climate models, these models are based on well-founded physical principles either directly for simulated processes or indirectly for parameterized processes. The results of one experiment are extensively checked by a large community of modelers and researchers around the world (for example, as part of the IPCC), which reduces uncertainty. Generally, models produce simulations of current and past large-scale climates that agree with observations. Climate models have also produced an accurate hindcast of 20th century climate change, including increased warming partly due to CO2 emissions. This gives us confidence in using these models to project future climate change.\nClimate models agree on certain basic aspects of future climate change. For example, they all show rising global temperatures with amplified warming in the Arctic, enhancement of the hydrologic cycle (dry places becoming dryer and wet places becoming wetter), and rising sea level. Many of these factors affect each other and could be drastically altered in an already changing climate. Climate models reduce the uncertainty of climate change impacts, which aids in adaptation. Generally, more confidence is placed in simulations that are at larger scales because of the agreement in global averages and patterns.\nClimate models can disagree on many results and projections due to natural variability, differences in forcing, and differences in feedbacks.

Models investigate the degree to which observed climate changes may be due to natural variability, human activity, or a combination of both. Their results and projections provide essential information to better inform decisions of national, regional, and local importance, such as water resource management, agriculture, transportation, and urban planning. The Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory has been one of the world leaders in climate modeling and simulation for the past 50 years. Beginning in the 1960s, GFDL scientists developed the first coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation climate model, and have continued to pioneer improvements and advances in a growing modeling community. State-of-the art climate modeling at GFDL requires vast computational resources, including supercomputers with thousands of processors and petabytes of data storage.\nA global climate model (GCM) is a complex mathematical representation of the major climate system components (atmosphere, land surface, ocean, and sea ice), and their interactions. Earth\u2019s energy balance between the four components is the key to long-term climate prediction. The main climate system components treated in a climate model are:\nClimate models divide the globe into a three-dimensional grid of cells representing specific geographic locations and elevations. Each of the components (atmosphere, land surface, ocean, and sea ice) has equations calculated on the global grid for a set of climate variables such as temperature. In addition to model components computing how they are changing over time, the different parts exchange fluxes of heat, water, and momentum. They interact with one another as a coupled system.\nGrid size is dependent upon the power of the computer that is available to solve these equations. Finer resolution implies a larger number of grid cells and requires a bigger and faster computer to perform the simulation. Similarly, if grid spacing is farther apart, there are fewer points that are calculated, but the results are also less detailed. Once the simulated time rate of change is computed (for example, how fast each particular grid cell is warming or cooling) that rate is assumed to hold for some length of time, and the updated values are computed at each grid point according to the previous values and trends. Then, calculations start over again for the next time interval.\nThere are two types of processes within climate models that are used today: simulated and parameterized. Simulated processes are larger than grid-scale and based on bedrock scientific principles (conservation of energy, mass, and momentum). An example of a simulated process is one that represents tropical cyclones and storm activity. Parameterized processes represent more complex processes that are smaller than grid scale (so, cannot be physically represented) using simpler processes. Their formulations are guided by fundamental physical principles, but also make use of observational data. An example of a parameterized process is one that represents cloud and aerosol composition.\nGCMs are critical tools that enable us to improve the understanding and prediction of atmosphere, ocean, and climate behavior. Models allow us to determine the distinct influence of different climate features by providing a way of exploring climate sensitivities with experiments that cannot be performed on the actual earth. Changes can be made to one feature in a climate model, such as warming or cooling ocean surface temperatures, to discern the impact those changes have on the climate. The uses for climate modeling also include diagnosis and prognosis. An example of a diagnostic use is detection and attribution. Detection and attribution require first demonstrating that a detected change is statistically significant, and then attributing this change to unnatural causes such as the role of anthropogenic forcing in 20th century climate change. Prognostic climate modeling predicts future climate, such as global warming trends, using current or historic data (ocean structure, radiative forcing, etc) as a basis. Timescales for projection include seasonal/interannual variability, decadal prediction, and 21st century scenarios.\nAlthough there is some level of disagreement among climate models, these models are based on well-founded physical principles either directly for simulated processes or indirectly for parameterized processes. The results of one experiment are extensively checked by a large community of modelers and researchers around the world (for example, as part of the IPCC), which reduces uncertainty. Generally, models produce simulations of current and past large-scale climates that agree with observations. Climate models have also produced an accurate hindcast of 20th century climate change, including increased warming partly due to CO2 emissions. This gives us confidence in using these models to project future climate change.\nClimate models agree on certain basic aspects of future climate change. For example, they all show rising global temperatures with amplified warming in the Arctic, enhancement of the hydrologic cycle (dry places becoming dryer and wet places becoming wetter), and rising sea level. Many of these factors affect each other and could be drastically altered in an already changing climate. Climate models reduce the uncertainty of climate change impacts, which aids in adaptation. Generally, more confidence is placed in simulations that are at larger scales because of the agreement in global averages and patterns.\nClimate models can disagree on many results and projections due to natural variability, differences in forcing, and differences in feedbacks. Natural climate variability can be reduced by using an ensemble of simulations with slight changes in each, which produces an average \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This information helps communities and land managers around the world prepare for and respond to fires, and also provides a rich data source to help scientists better understand this growing risk.\nNASA's Terra and Aqua satellites detect active wildfires twice each day. Scientists studied this data over a 21-year span and found that extreme wildfires have become more frequent, more intense, and larger. The largest increase in extreme fire behavior was in the temperate conifer forests of the Western U.S. and the boreal forests of northern North America and Russia. Warmer nighttime temperatures are a major contributing factor, allowing fire activity to persist overnight.\nSee the research - Increasing frequency and intensity of the most extreme wildfires on Earth\nIn 2021, a destructive wintertime wildfire in Colorado became part of a growing trend of wildfire activity extending well beyond the summer. By looking back at 35 years of weather data, U.S. Forest Service scientists found that fire seasons are starting earlier in the spring and extending later into autumn. Parts of the Western United States, Mexico, Brazil, and East Africa now have fire seasons that are more than a month longer than they were 35 years ago. Wildfires also can be a major source of carbon dioxide emissions. Researchers found that carbon emissions from forest fires increased by 60% globally between 2001 and 2023. Fire emissions from boreal forests in Eurasia and North America nearly tripled during that same time period, driven by a warmer, drier climate. In 2023, Canada\u2019s warmest and driest conditions since 1980 stoked extreme fires that lasted for five months. NASA researchers found that these fires released about 640 million metric tons of carbon. See the research: - Fire seasons getting longer, more frequent - Global rise in forest fire emissions linked to climate change in the extratropics\nNASA Study Tallies Carbon Emissions from Massive Canadian Fires\nAlthough some variations in the weather are natural, human-caused climate change has been found to be the main cause for increasing fire weather in the American West. As the planet warms, hotter weather, earlier melting of winter snow, warmer nighttime temperatures, and decreasing summer rainfall are all contributing to increased fire activity. In the Western U.S., the amount of summertime precipitation has the biggest effect on how much land area is burned in a given year. Historical efforts to reduce all wildfires led to decades of fire suppression, which has caused a buildup of fuels in some forests. This combination of fuel build-up and warmer, drier conditions increases the potential for extreme fires. See the research: - Decreasing fire season precipitation increased recent western U.S. forest wildfire activity - Quantifying contributions of natural variability and anthropogenic forcings on increased fire weather risk over the Western United States\nA Drier Future Sets the Stage for More Wildfires\nFire is a natural part of many landscapes, and sometimes it is beneficial to forests and grassland ecosystems that have evolved with fire. Many different factors influence wildfire behavior, such as forest health, weather, topography, and forest management practices. A warming climate is increasing some types of fire activity, leading to larger and more destructive fires, more intensive firefighting efforts, and widespread smoke\nThe size and number of wildfires in the United States has been recorded since 1983 by the National Interagency Fire Center. Over the past 20 years, the amount of land area burned each year has increased as wildfires have grown larger, while the number of fires each year has remained fairly constant.\nSee the data from the National Interagency Fire Center (current through 2023)\nFires are part of both natural processes and human land use practices. Our ability to understand fire activity in different parts of the world is strengthened by international collaborations such as the Global Wildfire Information System, which includes data from NASA satellites. For example, Indigenous and nomadic cultures have historically relied on fire as a tool to clear land, keep shrubs from encroaching into grazing areas, and maintain healthy ecosystems. Periodic fires have played a role in stewarding savanna and grassland habitats for thousands of years. In some regions, fires are commonly used to clear crop residue and prepare land for new plantings. Over time, humans have gradually shifted away from nomadic life toward building homes, roads, and farms in permanent locations. These changes in cultural practices have reduced the use of fire as a land management tool. Global fire data shows that the total amount of land burned each year is decreasing, particularly in shrublands, grasslands, and savannas.\nLearn more: Building a Long-Term Record of Fire\nNASA\u2019s Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) mapping tool offers near-real time fire data.

Models investigate the degree to which observed climate changes may be due to natural variability, human activity, or a combination of both. Their results and projections provide essential information to better inform decisions of national, regional, and local importance, such as water resource management, agriculture, transportation, and urban planning. The Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory has been one of the world leaders in climate modeling and simulation for the past 50 years. Beginning in the 1960s, GFDL scientists developed the first coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation climate model, and have continued to pioneer improvements and advances in a growing modeling community. State-of-the art climate modeling at GFDL requires vast computational resources, including supercomputers with thousands of processors and petabytes of data storage.\nA global climate model (GCM) is a complex mathematical representation of the major climate system components (atmosphere, land surface, ocean, and sea ice), and their interactions. Earth\u2019s energy balance between the four components is the key to long-term climate prediction. The main climate system components treated in a climate model are:\nClimate models divide the globe into a three-dimensional grid of cells representing specific geographic locations and elevations. Each of the components (atmosphere, land surface, ocean, and sea ice) has equations calculated on the global grid for a set of climate variables such as temperature. In addition to model components computing how they are changing over time, the different parts exchange fluxes of heat, water, and momentum. They interact with one another as a coupled system.\nGrid size is dependent upon the power of the computer that is available to solve these equations. Finer resolution implies a larger number of grid cells and requires a bigger and faster computer to perform the simulation. Similarly, if grid spacing is farther apart, there are fewer points that are calculated, but the results are also less detailed. Once the simulated time rate of change is computed (for example, how fast each particular grid cell is warming or cooling) that rate is assumed to hold for some length of time, and the updated values are computed at each grid point according to the previous values and trends. Then, calculations start over again for the next time interval.\nThere are two types of processes within climate models that are used today: simulated and parameterized. Simulated processes are larger than grid-scale and based on bedrock scientific principles (conservation of energy, mass, and momentum). An example of a simulated process is one that represents tropical cyclones and storm activity. Parameterized processes represent more complex processes that are smaller than grid scale (so, cannot be physically represented) using simpler processes. Their formulations are guided by fundamental physical principles, but also make use of observational data. An example of a parameterized process is one that represents cloud and aerosol composition.\nGCMs are critical tools that enable us to improve the understanding and prediction of atmosphere, ocean, and climate behavior. Models allow us to determine the distinct influence of different climate features by providing a way of exploring climate sensitivities with experiments that cannot be performed on the actual earth. Changes can be made to one feature in a climate model, such as warming or cooling ocean surface temperatures, to discern the impact those changes have on the climate. The uses for climate modeling also include diagnosis and prognosis. An example of a diagnostic use is detection and attribution. Detection and attribution require first demonstrating that a detected change is statistically significant, and then attributing this change to unnatural causes such as the role of anthropogenic forcing in 20th century climate change. Prognostic climate modeling predicts future climate, such as global warming trends, using current or historic data (ocean structure, radiative forcing, etc) as a basis. Timescales for projection include seasonal/interannual variability, decadal prediction, and 21st century scenarios.\nAlthough there is some level of disagreement among climate models, these models are based on well-founded physical principles either directly for simulated processes or indirectly for parameterized processes. The results of one experiment are extensively checked by a large community of modelers and researchers around the world (for example, as part of the IPCC), which reduces uncertainty. Generally, models produce simulations of current and past large-scale climates that agree with observations. Climate models have also produced an accurate hindcast of 20th century climate change, including increased warming partly due to CO2 emissions. This gives us confidence in using these models to project future climate change.\nClimate models agree on certain basic aspects of future climate change. For example, they all show rising global temperatures with amplified warming in the Arctic, enhancement of the hydrologic cycle (dry places becoming dryer and wet places becoming wetter), and rising sea level. Many of these factors affect each other and could be drastically altered in an already changing climate. Climate models reduce the uncertainty of climate change impacts, which aids in adaptation. Generally, more confidence is placed in simulations that are at larger scales because of the agreement in global averages and patterns.\nClimate models can disagree on many results and projections due to natural variability, differences in forcing, and differences in feedbacks. Natural climate variability can be reduced by using an ensemble of simulations with slight changes in each, which produces an average \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Loss events included Hurricane Dorian, which caused billions of dollars in damage, especially in the Bahamas, in late August to early September. Heavy losses that year also resulted from severe weather, floods, and a winter storm in the United States. A mixture of snowmelt triggered by unusually high temperatures in March and storms with torrential rain led to sustained and extensive flooding in Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, and Mississippi (49).\nOverall, the numbers and costs of disasters have been increasing for several decades due to increases in exposure (more people moving into harm\u2019s way and increases in the values of property and infrastructure at risk), vulnerability of people and infrastructure, and climate change (170). Since 1980, the United States has experienced 265 weather and climate disasters in which the overall damages reached or exceeded US$1 billion; the total costs were greater than US$1.775 trillion (132), with an estimated 14,223 deaths (an average of 356 per year), although the numbers of deaths are likely an underestimate (178).\nBeyond the damage to infrastructure, extreme weather events and disasters can affect the health and well-being of individuals and can have catastrophic impacts on communities and health systems.

Located on a 5-mile-long (8-kilometer-long) barrier island, the community is separated from the mainland by the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway and marsh savannas. It\u2019s a pleasant seaside resort, with restaurants, tourist amenities, and row upon row of stilt homes, many right on the beach. My bedroom looked out over small sand dunes to the shimmering Atlantic, which, at high tide, ebbed and flowed not much farther than a stone\u2019s throw away. From my vantage point, there were no clues that the sea here might not always be a friendly neighbor.\nA short stroll along the beach quickly provided a starkly different perspective. Just a few dozen yards away, huge sandbags were piled high, guarding a number of homes from the sea. As I continued walking, I soon found myself in front of homes that were perched literally above the waves at high tide.\nI passed a woman walking her dog and asked her about the homes. \u201cThere used to be two streets of houses in front of these homes,\u201d she told me. \u201cNow they\u2019re oceanfront.\u201d\nIt turns out the homes at the east end of Ocean Isle Beach were victims of coastal erosion, which is common at most beaches in North Carolina and throughout the world. An eroding beach can lose several feet of sand a year. Of course, storms, including hurricanes, can result in rapid beach erosion. But there\u2019s also chronic, long-term erosion, caused by changes in the supply of sand to a beach and in relative sea level (how much the height of the ocean rises or falls relative to the land at a particular location). Records show sea level in this part of coastal North Carolina has risen about 7.6 centimeters (3 inches) since the early 1980s. According to the U.S. Global Change Research Program, coastal erosion results in U.S. coastal property losses of about a half billion dollars each year in the form of damaged structures and lost land.\nThe case of Ocean Isle Beach illustrates a key paradox about sea level rise: since it occurs relatively slowly, it can be easy to think it\u2019s not happening. But as oceanographer and climate scientist Josh Willis of NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, told me, if you\u2019re not seeing it, you\u2019re just not looking in the right place.\n\u201cThanks to satellite and tide gauge data, we know that sea level is rising about 3.3 millimeters (0.13 inches) a year, a rate that grows by another 1 millimeter (0.04 inches) per year every decade or so,\u201d Willis said. \u201cEach year, global warming is currently adding about 750 gigatonnes of water to the ocean \u2013 enough to cover my home state of Texas about 1 meter (more than 3 feet) deep. We can\u2019t really eyeball a few millimeters of sea level rise a year just by looking at the ocean because of waves, tides, etc. But we can definitely see the effects of it, both short- and long-term.\u201d\nWillis said sea level rise accelerates and exacerbates the natural coastal erosion that\u2019s continually taking place in locations like Ocean Isle Beach. \u201cSea level rise literally eats away at a coastline, making it more vulnerable to floods,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile floods happen naturally, it\u2019s sea level rise that causes them to gradually begin topping natural barriers\u2014like wetlands, mangrove forests and saltwater marshes\u2014and even human-built barriers that typically protect coastal areas around the world from flooding. All of a sudden, that flood that you used to be protected from is now wiping you out.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the same story all over the world. You may not be able to eyeball sea level rise at your local beach, but its effects are being felt in many ways. Willis says a good rule of thumb is that every inch of sea level rise results in the loss of about 2.5 meters (100 inches) of beach, though recent studies suggest beach losses around the globe could happen even faster.\nIn many places, sea level rise has rendered sea walls erected decades ago to handle 100-year floods inadequate. Floods that used to occur once a century are now happening once a decade. You can also see the impacts of sea level rise reflected in gradual damage to infrastructure, such as the condition of coastal roads like California\u2019s Pacific Coast Highway, which is continually battling the effects of coastal erosion.\nAnother phenomenon many people are experiencing more frequently but may not necessarily think is an impact of sea level rise is high tide flooding, otherwise known as \u201cnuisance,\u201d or \u201csunny day\u201d flooding. This type of flooding, which is generally low-level, occurs year-round during high tides. Its effects range from inconveniences to the public, such as the closure of roads, businesses and schools, to long-term infrastructure damage and overwhelmed storm drains. Climate-related sea level rise is a primary contributor to high tide flooding, as is the loss of natural coastal barriers. Another contributor is the sinking of coastal lands due to adjustments related to the end of the last Ice Age, tectonics, compaction of sediments, and other dynamic processes. In the United States, high tide flooding is especially common along the East and Gulf Coasts. Over the last two decades, their frequency is up by roughly 50 percent; 100 percent if you go back three decades.\nNorfolk, Virginia, is a good case in point. Norfolk, home to the world\u2019s largest Naval base, is one of several municipalities that comprise Virginia\u2019s Hampton Roads region, which has a population of more than 1.8 million. In the 20th century, sea level relative to land in Norfolk rose between 4 and 5 millimeters (0.16 to 0.2 inches) a year, in part because the land in this region is sinking as it continues to adjust to the melting of the Laurentide ice sheet that covered it during the last Ice Age. Over the past couple of decades, high tide flooding here has accelerated rapidly, and now occurs about 10 days a year, causing flooding in\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

We can\u2019t really eyeball a few millimeters of sea level rise a year just by looking at the ocean because of waves, tides, etc. But we can definitely see the effects of it, both short- and long-term.\u201d\nWillis said sea level rise accelerates and exacerbates the natural coastal erosion that\u2019s continually taking place in locations like Ocean Isle Beach. \u201cSea level rise literally eats away at a coastline, making it more vulnerable to floods,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile floods happen naturally, it\u2019s sea level rise that causes them to gradually begin topping natural barriers\u2014like wetlands, mangrove forests and saltwater marshes\u2014and even human-built barriers that typically protect coastal areas around the world from flooding. All of a sudden, that flood that you used to be protected from is now wiping you out.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the same story all over the world. You may not be able to eyeball sea level rise at your local beach, but its effects are being felt in many ways. Willis says a good rule of thumb is that every inch of sea level rise results in the loss of about 2.5 meters (100 inches) of beach, though recent studies suggest beach losses around the globe could happen even faster.\nIn many places, sea level rise has rendered sea walls erected decades ago to handle 100-year floods inadequate. Floods that used to occur once a century are now happening once a decade. You can also see the impacts of sea level rise reflected in gradual damage to infrastructure, such as the condition of coastal roads like California\u2019s Pacific Coast Highway, which is continually battling the effects of coastal erosion.\nAnother phenomenon many people are experiencing more frequently but may not necessarily think is an impact of sea level rise is high tide flooding, otherwise known as \u201cnuisance,\u201d or \u201csunny day\u201d flooding. This type of flooding, which is generally low-level, occurs year-round during high tides. Its effects range from inconveniences to the public, such as the closure of roads, businesses and schools, to long-term infrastructure damage and overwhelmed storm drains. Climate-related sea level rise is a primary contributor to high tide flooding, as is the loss of natural coastal barriers. Another contributor is the sinking of coastal lands due to adjustments related to the end of the last Ice Age, tectonics, compaction of sediments, and other dynamic processes. In the United States, high tide flooding is especially common along the East and Gulf Coasts.

Norfolk, home to the world\u2019s largest Naval base, is one of several municipalities that comprise Virginia\u2019s Hampton Roads region, which has a population of more than 1.8 million. In the 20th century, sea level relative to land in Norfolk rose between 4 and 5 millimeters (0.16 to 0.2 inches) a year, in part because the land in this region is sinking as it continues to adjust to the melting of the Laurentide ice sheet that covered it during the last Ice Age.

Located on a 5-mile-long (8-kilometer-long) barrier island, the community is separated from the mainland by the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway and marsh savannas. It\u2019s a pleasant seaside resort, with restaurants, tourist amenities, and row upon row of stilt homes, many right on the beach. My bedroom looked out over small sand dunes to the shimmering Atlantic, which, at high tide, ebbed and flowed not much farther than a stone\u2019s throw away. From my vantage point, there were no clues that the sea here might not always be a friendly neighbor.\nA short stroll along the beach quickly provided a starkly different perspective. Just a few dozen yards away, huge sandbags were piled high, guarding a number of homes from the sea. As I continued walking, I soon found myself in front of homes that were perched literally above the waves at high tide.\nI passed a woman walking her dog and asked her about the homes. \u201cThere used to be two streets of houses in front of these homes,\u201d she told me. \u201cNow they\u2019re oceanfront.\u201d\nIt turns out the homes at the east end of Ocean Isle Beach were victims of coastal erosion, which is common at most beaches in North Carolina and throughout the world. An eroding beach can lose several feet of sand a year. Of course, storms, including hurricanes, can result in rapid beach erosion. But there\u2019s also chronic, long-term erosion, caused by changes in the supply of sand to a beach and in relative sea level (how much the height of the ocean rises or falls relative to the land at a particular location). Records show sea level in this part of coastal North Carolina has risen about 7.6 centimeters (3 inches) since the early 1980s. According to the U.S. Global Change Research Program, coastal erosion results in U.S. coastal property losses of about a half billion dollars each year in the form of damaged structures and lost land.\nThe case of Ocean Isle Beach illustrates a key paradox about sea level rise: since it occurs relatively slowly, it can be easy to think it\u2019s not happening.

Blue bars indicate cooler-than-average years; red bars show warmer-than-average years. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Information.\nAccording to the annual report from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, 2024 was the warmest year since global records began in 1850. The global average surface temperature was 2.32 Fahrenheit (1.29 degrees Celsius) above the 20th-century average (57.0 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.9 degrees Celsius) and 2.63 degrees Fahrenheit (1.46 degrees Celsius) above the pre-industrial average (56.7 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.7 degrees Celsius), which NOAA defines as the period from 1850-1900.\nGlobal temperatures in 2024 were above the 1991-2020 average (red) across most of the planet. Yearly temperatures compared to the 20th-century average (bar chart) show that it has been 48 years since Earth had a cooler-than-average year. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe 2024 global temperature anomaly (anomaly means \u201cdifference from average\u201d) is 0.18 degrees F (0.10 degrees C) warmer than the previous record, set the year before, in 2023. The ten warmest years in the 175-year record have all occurred during the last decade (2015\u20132024). When the new century started in 2000, the first year to set a new high-temperature record was 2005. Now, 2005 is just the 13th-warmest year on record.\nOther 2024 rankings included...\nFor more regional details and 2024 climate statistics, see the 2024 Global Climate Report from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe global average surface temperature is an indicator of the state of Earth\u2019s energy balance: how much sunlight it absorbs minus how much heat it radiates back to space. When these amounts are the same, Earth\u2019s average surface temperature remains steady. When they are out of balance, Earth cools or warms. Earth\u2019s average surface temperature has been rising because human-produced greenhouse gases are causing Earth to absorb more energy than it radiates back to space.\nGiven the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of added heat energy to raise Earth\u2019s average surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree-Fahrenheit (1-degree-Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1850-1900 in NOAA's record) might seem small, but it represents a significant increase in heat energy circulating through all parts of the Earth system, including the oceans, frozen landscapes, and the atmosphere.\nBeyond being an indicator of changes in Earth\u2019s energy balance, surface temperature matters because it controls many environmental and ecological processes that are important to humans and other life, including the water cycle (evaporation, clouds, surface water supplies, and precipitation), the carbon cycle, and the kinds of plants, animals, and other living things that can survive in different places on Earth.\nThe concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (55 degrees Celsius) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the \"average\" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget, which can only be directly measured from space.\nTo calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute temperature readings to temperature anomalies\u2014the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend.\nAcross inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and known physical relationships\u2014such as the way temperature decreases with altitude\u2014to estimate the missing values. Each value is then used to calculate a global-scale temperature anomaly. This process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in Earth's surface temperature over time. Read more about how the global surface temperature record is built in our Climate Data Primer.\nTemperature change has not been uniform across the planet, but more areas are warming than cooling. And the rate of warming has accelerated in recent decades. According to NOAA's 2024 Annual Climate Report the combined land and ocean temperature has warmed at an average rate of 0.11 degrees Fahrenheit (0.06 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1850 and more than three times that rate (0.36 degrees Fahrenheit, or 0.20 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1975.\nRecent rates of global warming (1994-2024, bottom) are larger than the longer-term average rates (1901-2024, top). Places that have cooled are colored blue; places that have warmed are colored yellow, orange, or red. In the past three decades, many places in the Northern Hemisphere have warmed by 1 degree Fahrenheit or more per decade. Differences are most dramatic in the Arctic.

And the rate of warming has accelerated in recent decades. According to NOAA's 2024 Annual Climate Report the combined land and ocean temperature has warmed at an average rate of 0.11 degrees Fahrenheit (0.06 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1850 and more than three times that rate (0.36 degrees Fahrenheit, or 0.20 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1975.\nRecent rates of global warming (1994-2024, bottom) are larger than the longer-term average rates (1901-2024, top). Places that have cooled are colored blue; places that have warmed are colored yellow, orange, or red. In the past three decades, many places in the Northern Hemisphere have warmed by 1 degree Fahrenheit or more per decade. Differences are most dramatic in the Arctic.

NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Information.\nAccording to the annual report from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, 2024 was the warmest year since global records began in 1850. The global average surface temperature was 2.32 Fahrenheit (1.29 degrees Celsius) above the 20th-century average (57.0 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.9 degrees Celsius) and 2.63 degrees Fahrenheit (1.46 degrees Celsius) above the pre-industrial average (56.7 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.7 degrees Celsius), which NOAA defines as the period from 1850-1900.\nGlobal temperatures in 2024 were above the 1991-2020 average (red) across most of the planet. Yearly temperatures compared to the 20th-century average (bar chart) show that it has been 48 years since Earth had a cooler-than-average year. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe 2024 global temperature anomaly (anomaly means \u201cdifference from average\u201d) is 0.18 degrees F (0.10 degrees C) warmer than the previous record, set the year before, in 2023. The ten warmest years in the 175-year record have all occurred during the last decade (2015\u20132024). When the new century started in 2000, the first year to set a new high-temperature record was 2005. Now, 2005 is just the 13th-warmest year on record.\nOther 2024 rankings included...\nFor more regional details and 2024 climate statistics, see the 2024 Global Climate Report from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe global average surface temperature is an indicator of the state of Earth\u2019s energy balance: how much sunlight it absorbs minus how much heat it radiates back to space. When these amounts are the same, Earth\u2019s average surface temperature remains steady. When they are out of balance, Earth cools or warms. Earth\u2019s average surface temperature has been rising because human-produced greenhouse gases are causing Earth to absorb more energy than it radiates back to space.\nGiven the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of added heat energy to raise Earth\u2019s average surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree-Fahrenheit (1-degree-Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1850-1900 in NOAA's record) might seem small, but it represents a significant increase in heat energy circulating through all parts of the Earth system, including the oceans, frozen landscapes, and the atmosphere.\nBeyond being an indicator of changes in Earth\u2019s energy balance, surface temperature matters because it controls many environmental and ecological processes that are important to humans and other life, including the water cycle (evaporation, clouds, surface water supplies, and precipitation), the carbon cycle, and the kinds of plants, animals, and other living things that can survive in different places on Earth.\nThe concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (55 degrees Celsius) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the \"average\" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget, which can only be directly measured from space.\nTo calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute temperature readings to temperature anomalies\u2014the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend.\nAcross inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and known physical relationships\u2014such as the way temperature decreases with altitude\u2014to estimate the missing values.
