Glacier mass balance is the annual balance between how much snow accumulates on a glacier and how much ice is lost through melting, sublimation (evaporation), or iceberg calving. Through 2024, these glaciers have lost more than 27 meters of water equivalent, which is roughly the same as slicing a 98-foot slab off the top of each glacier in the network. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from the WGMS.\nAmong the most dramatic evidence that Earth's climate is warming is the retreat and disappearance of mountain glaciers around the world. Based on preliminary data, 2023/24 was the 37th year in a row that the reference glaciers tracked by the World Glacier Monitoring Service lost rather than gained ice. Tallying up each year's losses or gains through 2023/24, reference network glaciers have lost ice mass equivalent to 27.3 meters of water since 1970\u2014like slicing an average of 30 meters (98 feet) of ice off the entire surface of every glacier.\nPedersen Glacier, at Aialik Bay in Alaska\u2019s Kenai Mountains, in 1917 (left) and 2005 (right). In the early 20th century, the glacier met the water and calved icebergs into a marginal lake near the bay. By 2005, the glacier had retreated, leaving behind sediment that allowed the lake to be transformed into a small grassland. Photos courtesy of Louis H. Pedersen (1917) and Bruce F. Molina (2005), obtained from the Glacier Photograph Collection, Boulder, Colorado USA: National Snow and Ice Data Center/World Data Center for Glaciology.\nJust as the rate of global average warming has accelerated in recent decades, the pace of glacier loss has also been accelerating since the 1980s. In State of the Climate in 2019, glacier expert Mauri Pelto reported that the pace of glacier loss in the WGMS reference network accelerated from -171 millimeters (6.7 inches) per year in the 1980s, to -460 millimeters (18 inches) per year in the 1990s, to -500 millimeters (20 inches) per year in the 2000s, to -889 millimeters (35 inches) per year for the 2010s.\nA global analysis published in 2025, combining satellite and ground-based measurements, highlighted the recent acceleration.\nAbout 41 % of the total loss since 1976\u2026occurred during the last decade from 2015 to 2024... .The strong acceleration of global glacier mass loss is evident over the last years of observations, where 5 (2019, 2020, 2022, 2023, and 2024) out of the last 6 years present the strongest global glacier mass loss ever recorded... . During 2023 alone, the glacier mass loss was about 80 Gt [80 billion metric tons] higher than any other year on record, corresponding to 6 % of the total loss since 1975/1976. In only this 1 year, glacier melt raised sea levels by 1.5 \u00b1 0.2 mm.\"\nAccording to the World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS), ice losses in the past three 3 years have each been greater than the average of the last full decade (2010-2019), which had the largest average loss of any decade back to 1950, the start of the record. Reference glaciers experienced ice losses equivalent to 1.1 meters of water in 2021/22, and 1.3 meters of water in 2022/23 and again in 2023/24. That's roughly 4 feet of ice off each glacier in the network each year.\nGlaciers gain mass directly through snowfall and indirectly through snow movement from wind and avalanches. They lose mass through melting and sublimation (when water evaporates directly from solid ice). Glaciers that terminate in a lake or the ocean also lose mass through iceberg calving. Those that end in the ocean are called tidewater glaciers, and they have more complex cycles of advance and retreat than glaciers that terminate on land. Even in a stable climate, such glaciers can experience periods of rapid retreat that are more influenced by seafloor topography and ocean circulation at their margins than by recent climate conditions.\nRetreat of southeastern Alaska\u2019s Muir Glacier between August 1941 and August 2004. Historically, Muir Glacier was an iceberg-calving, tidewater glacier. Its terminus was grounded in the waters of Muir Inlet, a narrow opening to Glacier Bay. In the six decades between the two photos, it has retreated so far that it's terminus is now inland. Photos from the National Snow and Ice Data Center\u2019s collection of repeat photography of glaciers.\nTo see if a glacier is growing or shrinking, glacier experts can check the condition of snow and ice at several locations on the glacier at the end of the melt season. The scientists check snow levels against stakes they\u2019ve inserted in the glacier, dig snow pits in the surface to examine the sequence of seasonal layers, and insert long poles into the glacier to probe characteristics of the snow and ice. Generally, the difference in thickness of snow from the previous measurement indicates the glacier\u2019s mass balance\u2014whether the glacier has grown or shrunk.\nOther techniques include repeat photography and satellite images to measure changes in area and the advance or retreat of the glacier\u2019s downhill edge. Scientists can estimate changes in glacier thickness over time with repeat measurements from radar altimeters, ground-penetrating radar, and digital topographic maps (digital elevation models) created from stereoscopic satellite images.\nScientists have described more than two hundred thousand glaciers as part of the GLIMS Glacier Database and the Randolph Glacier Inventory), but only a small fraction of these have been consistently monitored for long enough to measure climate-related changes in their size or mass. Scientists refer to this global collection of about 60 glaciers as \"climate reference\" glaciers. A given year's annual update will include 40 or so of the reference glaciers.

Atmospheric CO2 levels at Mauna Loa Observatory. ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nThis website is an ARCHIVED version of NOAA Climate.gov as of June 25, 2025. Content is not being updated or maintained, and some links may no longer work.\nThe modern record of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels began with observations recorded at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. This graph shows the station's monthly average carbon dioxide measurements since 1958 in parts per million (ppm). The seasonal cycle of highs and lows (small peaks and valleys) is driven by Northern Hemisphere summer vegetation growth, which reduces atmospheric carbon dioxide, and winter decay, which increases it. The long-term trend of rising carbon dioxide levels is driven by human activities. At Mauna Loa, the highest monthly value each year occurs in May. In May 2024, carbon dioxide hit just under 427 ppm\u2014a new record. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on Mauna Loa monthly mean data from NOAA Global Monitoring Lab.\nBased on the annual analysis from NOAA\u2019s Global Monitoring Lab, global average atmospheric carbon dioxide was 422.8 parts per million (\u201cppm,\u201d for short) in 2024, a new record high. The increase during 2024 was 3.75 ppm\u2014the largest one-year increase on record. At Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii (graph above), where the modern carbon dioxide record began in 1958, the annual average carbon dioxide in 2024 was 424.61 ppm, also a new record.\nThe years with the largest annual carbon dioxide growth tend to be associated with the strongest El Ni\u00f1os\u2014the warm phase of a natural climate pattern in the tropical Pacific\u2014which lead to high temperatures over land and sea and an expansion of global drought area. In turn, these weather conditions typically lead to less plant growth, which reduces carbon dioxide uptake, as well as increased decomposition of carbon in soil and increased carbon dioxide emissions from forest fires. Together, these impacts cause atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to rise faster than normal.\nEven though the 2023-24 El Ni\u00f1o had waned by April, record high air temperatures and drought in all of 2024, similar to those during an El Nino, were likely drivers of the large increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide in 2024. In addition to other factors, large forest fires in both the Amazon and Canada contributed to the 2024 global increase.\nCarbon dioxide concentrations are rising mostly because of the fossil fuels that people have been burning for energy since the start of the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuels like coal and oil contain the carbon from millions of years of photosynthesis\u2014the process by which plants remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. We are returning that carbon to the atmosphere in just a few hundred years. Since the middle of the 20th century, annual emissions of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels have increased every decade, from close to 11 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year in the 1960s to an estimated 37.4 billion tons in 2024 according to the Global Carbon Budget 2024.\nThe amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (blue line) has increased along with human emissions (gray line) since the start of the Industrial Revolution in 1750. Emissions rose slowly to about 5 gigatons (1 gigaton is 1 billion metric tons per year) in the mid-20th century before rapidly increasing to more than 35 billion tons per year by the end of the century. NOAA Climate.gov graph, adapted from original by Dr. Howard Diamond (NOAA ARL). Atmospheric carbon dioxide data from NOAA and ETHZ. Carbon dioxide emissions data from Our World in Data and the Global Carbon Project.\nCarbon cycle experts estimate that natural \u201csinks,\u201d including plant growth and ocean absorption, remove about half of carbon dioxide humans emit into the atmosphere from fossil fuel burning. The rest stays in the atmosphere. Every year, we are adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than natural sinks can remove, and so the total amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere goes up. The bigger the overshoot, the faster atmospheric carbon dioxide increases.\nIn the 1960s, atmospheric carbon dioxide increased by about 0.8 ppm per year on average. That growth rate doubled to an average of 1.6 ppm per year in the 1980s and 1.5 ppm per year in the 1990s. In the last decade (2015-2024), the annual increase has accelerated to 2.6 ppm per year. As a result, the annual rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide over the past 60 years is 100-200 times faster than the increase that occurred at the end of the last ice age 11,000-17,000 years ago.\nCarbon dioxide is Earth\u2019s most important long-lived greenhouse gas: a gas that absorbs and radiates heat. Unlike oxygen or nitrogen (which make up most of Earth's atmosphere), greenhouse gases absorb heat radiating from the Earth\u2019s surface and re-release it in all directions\u2014including back toward Earth\u2019s surface. Without any carbon dioxide, Earth\u2019s natural greenhouse effect would be too weak to keep the average global surface temperature above freezing.\nBy adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, people are amplifying the natural greenhouse effect, causing global temperature to rise. According to observations and analysis by the NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory, carbon dioxide alone is responsible for about 80 percent of the total heating influence of all human-produced greenhouse gases since 1990.\nAnother reason carbon dioxide is important in the Earth system is that it dissolves into the ocean like the fizz in a can of soda. It reacts with water molecules, producing carbonic acid and lowering the ocean's pH (raising its acidity). Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, the pH of the ocean's surface waters has dropped from 8.21 to 8.10. This drop in pH is called ocean acidification, and it interferes with the ability of marine life to extract calcium from sea water to build skeletons and shells.\n(left) A healthy ocean snail has a transparent shell with smoothly contoured ridges.

These molecules eventually escaped into space and were replaced by our second atmosphere: volcanic emissions. Eruptions dispersed water steam, CO2, and ammonia (one nitrogen and three hydrogens), forming a gassy blanket above and early water bodies below. CO2 slowly dissolved into the shallow ocean and allowed cyanobacteria to perform oxygen-emitting photosynthesis. This oxygen eventually accumulated until the atmospheric composition changed enough to kill off most micro-organisms present at the time, about 2.4 billion years ago.\nAs a point of reference, pre-industrial CO2 levels were around 280 parts per million (ppm). Today, we stand near 426.24 ppm.\nThe most distant period in time for which we have estimated CO2 levels is around the Ordovician period, 500 million years ago. At the time, atmospheric CO2 concentration ranged between 3,000 to 9,000 ppm. The average temperature wasn\u2019t much more than 10C above today\u2019s temperature, and those of you who have heard of the runaway hothouse Earth scenario may wonder why it didn\u2019t happen then. Major factors were that the Sun was cooler, and the planet\u2019s orbital cycles were different.\nCO2 levels are determined by the imbalance between carbon sequestration (burial in sediments, capture by plants), and carbon emissions (decomposition and volcanic activity). Imbalances in this system created a downward trend in CO2 levels, leading to a glaciation period around 300 million years ago. This was followed by a period of intense volcanic activity, doubling CO2 concentration to about 1,000 ppm. Levels then dropped until they reached today\u2019s concentrations during the Oligocene era, 33 to 23 million years ago, when temperatures were still 4-6C higher than today.\nThis is quite a worrying fact as the amounts of greenhouse gases we have emitted could already potentially take us back to similar conditions.\nIt is undeniable that the climate is an extremely complicated system with many factors that we still do not quite understand, so such statements need to be taken with a grain of salt.

The seasonal cycle of highs and lows (small peaks and valleys) is driven by Northern Hemisphere summer vegetation growth, which reduces atmospheric carbon dioxide, and winter decay, which increases it. The long-term trend of rising carbon dioxide levels is driven by human activities. At Mauna Loa, the highest monthly value each year occurs in May. In May 2024, carbon dioxide hit just under 427 ppm\u2014a new record. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on Mauna Loa monthly mean data from NOAA Global Monitoring Lab.\nBased on the annual analysis from NOAA\u2019s Global Monitoring Lab, global average atmospheric carbon dioxide was 422.8 parts per million (\u201cppm,\u201d for short) in 2024, a new record high. The increase during 2024 was 3.75 ppm\u2014the largest one-year increase on record. At Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii (graph above), where the modern carbon dioxide record began in 1958, the annual average carbon dioxide in 2024 was 424.61 ppm, also a new record.\nThe years with the largest annual carbon dioxide growth tend to be associated with the strongest El Ni\u00f1os\u2014the warm phase of a natural climate pattern in the tropical Pacific\u2014which lead to high temperatures over land and sea and an expansion of global drought area. In turn, these weather conditions typically lead to less plant growth, which reduces carbon dioxide uptake, as well as increased decomposition of carbon in soil and increased carbon dioxide emissions from forest fires. Together, these impacts cause atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to rise faster than normal.\nEven though the 2023-24 El Ni\u00f1o had waned by April, record high air temperatures and drought in all of 2024, similar to those during an El Nino, were likely drivers of the large increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide in 2024. In addition to other factors, large forest fires in both the Amazon and Canada contributed to the 2024 global increase.\nCarbon dioxide concentrations are rising mostly because of the fossil fuels that people have been burning for energy since the start of the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuels like coal and oil contain the carbon from millions of years of photosynthesis\u2014the process by which plants remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. We are returning that carbon to the atmosphere in just a few hundred years. Since the middle of the 20th century, annual emissions of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels have increased every decade, from close to 11 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year in the 1960s to an estimated 37.4 billion tons in 2024 according to the Global Carbon Budget 2024.\nThe amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (blue line) has increased along with human emissions (gray line) since the start of the Industrial Revolution in 1750. Emissions rose slowly to about 5 gigatons (1 gigaton is 1 billion metric tons per year) in the mid-20th century before rapidly increasing to more than 35 billion tons per year by the end of the century. NOAA Climate.gov graph, adapted from original by Dr. Howard Diamond (NOAA ARL). Atmospheric carbon dioxide data from NOAA and ETHZ. Carbon dioxide emissions data from Our World in Data and the Global Carbon Project.\nCarbon cycle experts estimate that natural \u201csinks,\u201d including plant growth and ocean absorption, remove about half of carbon dioxide humans emit into the atmosphere from fossil fuel burning. The rest stays in the atmosphere. Every year, we are adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than natural sinks can remove, and so the total amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere goes up. The bigger the overshoot, the faster atmospheric carbon dioxide increases.\nIn the 1960s, atmospheric carbon dioxide increased by about 0.8 ppm per year on average. That growth rate doubled to an average of 1.6 ppm per year in the 1980s and 1.5 ppm per year in the 1990s. In the last decade (2015-2024), the annual increase has accelerated to 2.6 ppm per year. As a result, the annual rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide over the past 60 years is 100-200 times faster than the increase that occurred at the end of the last ice age 11,000-17,000 years ago.\nCarbon dioxide is Earth\u2019s most important long-lived greenhouse gas: a gas that absorbs and radiates heat. Unlike oxygen or nitrogen (which make up most of Earth's atmosphere), greenhouse gases absorb heat radiating from the Earth\u2019s surface and re-release it in all directions\u2014including back toward Earth\u2019s surface. Without any carbon dioxide, Earth\u2019s natural greenhouse effect would be too weak to keep the average global surface temperature above freezing.\nBy adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, people are amplifying the natural greenhouse effect, causing global temperature to rise. According to observations and analysis by the NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory, carbon dioxide alone is responsible for about 80 percent of the total heating influence of all human-produced greenhouse gases since 1990.\nAnother reason carbon dioxide is important in the Earth system is that it dissolves into the ocean like the fizz in a can of soda. It reacts with water molecules, producing carbonic acid and lowering the ocean's pH (raising its acidity). Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, the pH of the ocean's surface waters has dropped from 8.21 to 8.10. This drop in pH is called ocean acidification, and it interferes with the ability of marine life to extract calcium from sea water to build skeletons and shells.\n(left) A healthy ocean snail has a transparent shell with smoothly contoured ridges.

Recognizing the human-driven causes of climate change can help build a more sustainable future.\nGas and steam rise out of smokestacks at an oil refinery in Omsk, Russia on February 8, 2023.\nSource: Alexey Malgavko / Reuters\nHave you ever wondered how your favorite products\u2014like that cool jacket, new iPhone, or tasty snack\u2014affect the environment? Even if it\u2019s something you don\u2019t think about often, like air conditioning or refrigeration, you'd likely miss it if it were gone.\nMany products you use have hidden environmental costs, and some generate huge quantities of greenhouse gases. Every step in the life cycle of a product leaves a mark. Emissions can occur as raw materials are extracted and processed in factories, packaged, and then shipped. Even after you\u2019ve bought something, its harm to the climate could continue through the electricity it uses to operate, the power needed to run it through the wash, or the waste it generates once it's discarded.\nBut what exactly are greenhouse gases, and why do they have such a profound effect on Earth\u2019s climate? Understanding how greenhouse gases originate and how to measure their effects on the climate is crucial for tackling the biggest environmental challenge of our time. In this resource, you\u2019ll learn how everyday actions and choices can help or hurt our planet.\nHumans have dramatically changed the atmosphere over the past few centuries, mainly by releasing vast amounts of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2). That story begins in the 1700s with the Industrial Revolution, a time when human society began to change rapidly. Before that period, economies relied largely on agriculture. Most finished products were produced slowly and laboriously by skilled artisans. Human activity still produced greenhouse gases, but at much lower levels.\nEverything shifted when new manufacturing processes and machines, like the steam engine, arrived on the scene. To power growing industries, societies needed to burn fuel, and lots of it. Increasingly, that fuel came in the form of coal.\nA painting from 1855 of the Burmeister and Wain iron foundry in Copenhagen, Denmark.\nSource: Peder Severin Kroye via Statens Museum for Kunst\nCoal was a game changer because it was relatively packed with energy (around three times as much energy as the same amount of wood), and it was relatively easy to access. When burned, coal could efficiently power the new steam engines that drove factories, trains, and ships, allowing industries to grow like never before. Coal use set off a chain reaction: factories popped up everywhere, cities expanded, and people began moving in huge numbers to urban areas for work. That sparked the beginning of a global shift toward using fossil fuels\u2014coal, oil, and natural gas\u2014to power nearly every aspect of modern life.\nToday, those fuels are the backbone of modern society. However, burning fossil fuels releases CO2 into the atmosphere. How does that happen? Well, fossil fuels are formed from the remains of ancient plants and animals buried deep in the earth\u2014most of which are composed of carbon. Over millions of years, heat and pressure turned those remains into energy-rich substances. So, when people burn those fuels for energy, they are sending CO2, which was once trapped underground, into the atmosphere. The CO2 then traps heat from the sun in the atmosphere, making the earth warmer\u2014a process known as the greenhouse effect.\nAlthough fossil fuels are the main culprits, other human activity is driving climate change too.

Understanding how greenhouse gases originate and how to measure their effects on the climate is crucial for tackling the biggest environmental challenge of our time. In this resource, you\u2019ll learn how everyday actions and choices can help or hurt our planet.\nHumans have dramatically changed the atmosphere over the past few centuries, mainly by releasing vast amounts of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2). That story begins in the 1700s with the Industrial Revolution, a time when human society began to change rapidly. Before that period, economies relied largely on agriculture. Most finished products were produced slowly and laboriously by skilled artisans. Human activity still produced greenhouse gases, but at much lower levels.\nEverything shifted when new manufacturing processes and machines, like the steam engine, arrived on the scene. To power growing industries, societies needed to burn fuel, and lots of it. Increasingly, that fuel came in the form of coal.\nA painting from 1855 of the Burmeister and Wain iron foundry in Copenhagen, Denmark.\nSource: Peder Severin Kroye via Statens Museum for Kunst\nCoal was a game changer because it was relatively packed with energy (around three times as much energy as the same amount of wood), and it was relatively easy to access. When burned, coal could efficiently power the new steam engines that drove factories, trains, and ships, allowing industries to grow like never before. Coal use set off a chain reaction: factories popped up everywhere, cities expanded, and people began moving in huge numbers to urban areas for work. That sparked the beginning of a global shift toward using fossil fuels\u2014coal, oil, and natural gas\u2014to power nearly every aspect of modern life.\nToday, those fuels are the backbone of modern society. However, burning fossil fuels releases CO2 into the atmosphere. How does that happen? Well, fossil fuels are formed from the remains of ancient plants and animals buried deep in the earth\u2014most of which are composed of carbon. Over millions of years, heat and pressure turned those remains into energy-rich substances. So, when people burn those fuels for energy, they are sending CO2, which was once trapped underground, into the atmosphere. The CO2 then traps heat from the sun in the atmosphere, making the earth warmer\u2014a process known as the greenhouse effect.\nAlthough fossil fuels are the main culprits, other human activity is driving climate change too.

Greenhouse gases include, but are not limited to, water vapor, carbon dioxide ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nGreenhouse gases trap heat in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The gases let sunlight pass through, but they prevent heat from leaving the atmosphere. Naturally occurring greenhouse gases are needed to sustain life on Earth, and are in fact, one of the reasons life on Earth is even possible. However, human activities are emitting greenhouse gas concentrations that are far above what naturally occurs. This has and will continue to drive and accelerate change to the global climate and alter the way humans and all life on Earth will interact and exist on the planet.\nGreenhouse gases (GHGs) are those gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, such as:\nExcept for the fluorinated gases, these gases are emitted from both natural and human activities.\nAnother pollutant that contributes to climate change is black carbon (BC), which is not a gas, but is a component of particulate matter. Black carbon forms through the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, biofuel, and biomass.\nWhile all greenhouse gases warm the Earth by absorbing energy and slowing the rate at which that energy escapes to space, different greenhouse gases have different effects on the Earth\u2019s warming. Two key ways in which these gases differ from each other are their ability to absorb energy (their radiative efficiency), and how long they stay in the atmosphere (their lifetime).\nGlobal Warming Potential (GWP) allows direct comparisons of the global warming impacts of the different greenhouse gases. Specifically, it\u2019s a measure of how much energy the emissions of 1 ton of a gas will absorb over a given time relative to the emissions of 1 ton of CO2. The larger the GWP, the more that a given greenhouse gas warms the Earth comparted to CO2. The GWP referenced on this page is based on a 100-year scale (GWP100).\nCarbon Dioxide (CO2) is the primary greenhouse gas contributing to climate change. CO2 is naturally present in the atmosphere as part of the global carbon cycle, which is the process of natural circulation of carbon through plant and animal respiration, volcanic eruptions, and ocean-atmosphere exchange.\nAtmospheric CO2 concentrations have increased by more than 40% since pre-industrial times, from approximately 280 parts per million by volume (ppmv) in the 18th century to over 400 ppmv in 2015. This has impacted the carbon cycle, affecting the natural cycles that maintain the Earth\u2019s geochemical and biological processes. Human activities currently release over 30 billion tons of CO2 into the atmosphere every year (Hayhoe, K., et al. 2018). The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) reports that these human-caused emissions are 135 times as much CO2 as volcanoes each year.\nThe Greenhouse Effect is a natural process that occurs when the Sun emits intense amounts of solar radiation, or sunlight. The sunlight is either absorbed by the Earth\u2019s surface and atmosphere or is reflected back into space (Wolff et al. 2020). The absorbed sunlight is trapped close to the Earth\u2019s surface by greenhouse gases. This process acts as a blanket for the planet, stabilizing the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and allowing the planet to stay warm enough to sustain life.\nClimate Change is driven by drastic increases in the concentration of greenhouse gases and other climate pollutants that occur in the atmosphere due to human activities. The Keeling Curve is a measurement of the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere made atop Hawaii\u2019s Mauna Loa since 1958. At the start of the Industrial Revolution, carbon dioxide levels were about 180 parts per million. The average annual carbon dioxide level initially exceeded 400 parts per million in 2016 and continues to rise (Tans and Keeling 2020). An increase in carbon dioxide of this magnitude is expected to result in an unprecedented increase in global temperature. However, exactly how much the average global temperature rises depends how much greenhouse gases are emitted around the globe into the future and how Earth\u2019s climate system responds to this human-induced warming.\nSee the current Keeling Curve, which is updated daily.\nWatch The Museum of Natural History\u2019s video on The Keeling Curve here.\nThank you for your interest in greenhouse gases!\nFor more information on greenhouse gases in New Jersey and climate impacts, please visit:\nHayhoe, K., D.

With more moisture available, rainfall can become heavier.\n\nFull Page Content:\nMany extreme weather events are becoming more common and more intense around the world, fuelled by human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels.\nHere are four ways that rising temperatures are affecting weather extremes.\nEven a small increase in average temperatures makes a big difference to heat extremes.\nAs the range of daily temperatures shifts to warmer levels, hotter days become more likely and more intense.\nScientists use computer models to simulate how individual extreme weather events unfold in two scenarios:\nThat way, they can estimate how much a particular heatwave, storm or drought was affected by climate change.\nIn the UK, temperatures topped 40C for the first time on record in July 2022, causing extensive disruption.\nThis would have been extremely unlikely without climate change, according to scientists at the World Weather Attribution group (WWA).\nIn June 2025, the Met Office said the chance of seeing temperatures above 40C was now more than 20 times greater than during than 1960s. And the likelihood of reaching such temperatures will continue to rise as the world warms, it said.\nAround the world, climate change has made countless heatwaves much more likely and more intense, the WWA says.\nExamples include 48C temperatures in Mali in April 2024 and prolonged, widespread heat in Scandinavia in July 2025, with temperatures regularly passing 30C in Norway.\nHeatwaves can happen as a result of heat domes, which are created when an area of high pressure stays over the same area for days or weeks, trapping hot air underneath.\nOne theory suggests that higher temperatures in the Arctic - which has warmed nearly four times faster than the global average - are affecting the fast band of winds high in the atmosphere known as the jet stream.\nThat could be making heat domes more likely, although this is not clear cut.\nFor every 1C rise in air temperature, the atmosphere can hold about 7% more moisture.\nWith more moisture available, rainfall can become heavier.\nBetween October 2023 and March 2024, the UK experienced the second-wettest such period on record.\nThis level of rainfall was made at least four times as likely by human-caused warming, according to the WWA.\nIn September 2024, deadly floods hit much of central Europe, including Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, Austria and Italy.\nThe intensity of the rainfall over four days in mid-September was made twice as likely by climate change, the WWA says.\nGlobally, heavy rainfall events have become more frequent and intense over most land regions due to human activity, according to the UN's climate body, the IPCC\nIt says this pattern will continue with further warming.\nVarious factors affect whether such heavy rainfall leads to flooding, including the quality of flood defences and drainage systems.\nLinking climate change with specific individual droughts can be difficult, because there are lots of different factors that affect the availability of water.\nNatural weather systems, for example, can play a key role, as was the case with drought in southern Africa in early 2024.\nBut climate change is shifting global rainfall patterns. While some of the world is getting wetter, other parts are becoming drier, which can make them more prone to drought.\nAnd heatwaves fuelled by climate change can worsen dry conditions when they do occur, by increasing evaporation from the soil.\nThis makes the air above warm up more quickly, leading to more intense heat.\nDuring periods of hot weather, increased demand for water, especially from farmers, puts even more stress on the water supply.\nIn parts of East Africa, there were five failed rainy seasons in a row between 2020 and 2022, as the region suffered its worst drought for 40 years. This displaced 1.2 million people in Somalia alone.\nClimate change has made droughts like this at least 100 times more likely, according to the WWA.\nHuman-caused warming was also the main driver of drought in the Amazon rainforest in the second half of 2023, the WWA found. This was the region's worst drought since modern records began.\nFires happen naturally in many parts of the world.\nIt is difficult to know if climate change has caused or worsened a specific wildfire because other factors are also relevant, such as changes to the way land is used.\nBut climate change is making the weather conditions needed for wildfires to spread more likely, the IPCC says.\nExtreme, long-lasting heat draws more moisture out of soils and vegetation.\nThese tinder-dry conditions provide fuel for fires, which can spread at an incredible speed, particularly if winds are strong.\nThe north-east Amazon experienced an extreme fire season in early 2024. Climate change made the weather conditions that helped the fires to spread between 30 and 70 times more likely, according to a report on the state of global wildfires.\nThat meant the burned area was about four times greater than if humans hadn't heated up the planet, the scientists found.\nMeanwhile, the burned area in the Southern California fires of January 2025 was about 25 times larger due to climate change, they estimated, although there are large uncertainties in the precise figures.\nMany fires are started deliberately or accidentally by humans. But rising temperatures may also increase the likelihood of lightning in the world's northernmost forests, which can in turn trigger more fires.\nThe combined effects of shifting land use and climate change mean extreme wildfires are projected to become more frequent and intense globally, according to the UN Environment Programme (UNEP).\nThe number of the most extreme fires may rise by up to 50% by 2100, UNEP suggests.\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

You can explore more at NOAA\u2019s Global Climate Dashboard.\nTemperature increased about 2\u00b0F (1.1\u00b0C) from 1850 to 2023. Updated January 2024.\nClimate change impacts our society in many different ways. Drought can harm food production and human health. Flooding can lead to spread of disease, death, and damage ecosystems and infrastructure. Human health issues that result from drought, flooding, and other weather conditions increase the death rate, change food availability, and limit how much a worker can get done, and ultimately the productivity of our economy.\nThere is still time to lessen the impacts and severity of climate change. We already know many of the problems and solutions offsite link , and researchers continue to find new ones. Experts believe we can avoid the worst outcomes by reducing emissions to zero as quickly as possible, which will limit warming offsite link . To meet this goal, we will have to invest in new technology and infrastructure, which will spur job growth. For example, we will need to continue improving technology and facilities that capture and process renewable energy. Lowering emissions will also benefit human health, saving countless lives and billions of dollars in expenses related to health.\nInteractive graphs and maps showing how climate conditions in U.S. states and territories are projected to change over the coming decades.\nIn the following sections, we will look at some of the effects climate change has on our resources and society. Use the links below to jump to a specific section.\nThe effects of climate change on our water resources can have a big impact on our world and our lives. Patterns of where, when, and how much precipitation falls are changing as temperatures rise. Some areas are experiencing heavier rain events while others are having more droughts.\nFlooding is an increasing issue as our climate is changing. Compared to the beginning of the 20th century, precipitation events are stronger, heavier, and more frequent across most of the United States.\nDrought is also becoming more common, especially in the Western United States. We are using more water during hot weather, especially for agriculture. Much like we sweat more when it is hot out, hot weather causes plants to lose, or transpire, more water. Then, farmers must give their crops more water.\nSnowpack is an important source of fresh water for many people. As the snow melts, fresh water becomes available for use. Snowmelt is particularly important in regions like the Western United States where there is not much precipitation in warmer months. But as temperatures warm, there is less snow and snow begins to melt earlier in the year. This means that snowpack is less likely to be a reliable source of water.\nOur food supply depends on climate and weather conditions. Higher temperatures, drought and water stress, diseases, and weather extremes create challenges for farmers and ranchers. Farmers, ranchers, and researchers can address some of these challenges by adapting their methods or creating and using new technology. But, some changes will be difficult to manage, like human and livestock health. Farmworkers can suffer from heat-related health issues, like exhaustion, heatstroke, and heart attacks. Heat can also harm livestock.\nFries depend on potatoes, and like all crops, potatoes have a preferred climate. How long will America\u2019s favorite side dish have a safe spot on our menu?\nClimate change is already impacting human health. Changes in weather and climate patterns put lives at risk in many ways:\nClimate change affects all living things, or organisms, and the environment they live in, but not equally. The Arctic is one of the ecosystems most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. It is warming at least twice as fast as the global average. Warming in the Arctic has impacts that are felt across the globe \u2014 melting land ice sheets and glaciers contribute dramatically offsite link to sea level rise. Sea levels are also rising due to thermal expansion. Higher sea level puts coastal areas at greater risk of erosion and storm surge.\nEffects of climate change can build upon one another to damage ecosystems. Sea level rise can cause sediment to smother corals. But, coral reefs are also vulnerable to many other effects of climate change: warming waters can lead to coral bleaching and stronger hurricanes can destroy reefs. Coral reef ecosystems are home to thousands of species, which rely on healthy coral reefs to survive.\nSome organisms are able to adapt to and even benefit from climate change. Some plants have longer growing seasons or are blooming earlier. But, these changes can happen too fast for other plants and animals to keep up. For example, an earlier blooming plant may depend on a pollinator that does not adapt as quickly.\nThere are also species that have adapted by expanding or shifting their geographic range, meaning they live in new pl\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and water vapor.\n\nFull Page Content:\nGreenhouse gases trap heat in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The gases let sunlight pass through, but they prevent heat from leaving the atmosphere. Naturally occurring greenhouse gases are needed to sustain life on Earth, and are in fact, one of the reasons life on Earth is even possible. However, human activities are emitting greenhouse gas concentrations that are far above what naturally occurs. This has and will continue to drive and accelerate change to the global climate and alter the way humans and all life on Earth will interact and exist on the planet.\nGreenhouse gases (GHGs) are those gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, such as:\nExcept for the fluorinated gases, these gases are emitted from both natural and human activities.\nAnother pollutant that contributes to climate change is black carbon (BC), which is not a gas, but is a component of particulate matter. Black carbon forms through the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, biofuel, and biomass.\nWhile all greenhouse gases warm the Earth by absorbing energy and slowing the rate at which that energy escapes to space, different greenhouse gases have different effects on the Earth\u2019s warming. Two key ways in which these gases differ from each other are their ability to absorb energy (their radiative efficiency), and how long they stay in the atmosphere (their lifetime).\nGlobal Warming Potential (GWP) allows direct comparisons of the global warming impacts of the different greenhouse gases. Specifically, it\u2019s a measure of how much energy the emissions of 1 ton of a gas will absorb over a given time relative to the emissions of 1 ton of CO2. The larger the GWP, the more that a given greenhouse gas warms the Earth comparted to CO2. The GWP referenced on this page is based on a 100-year scale (GWP100).\nCarbon Dioxide (CO2) is the primary greenhouse gas contributing to climate change. CO2 is naturally present in the atmosphere as part of the global carbon cycle, which is the process of natural circulation of carbon through plant and animal respiration, volcanic eruptions, and ocean-atmosphere exchange.\nAtmospheric CO2 concentrations have increased by more than 40% since pre-industrial times, from approximately 280 parts per million by volume (ppmv) in the 18th century to over 400 ppmv in 2015. This has impacted the carbon cycle, affecting the natural cycles that maintain the Earth\u2019s geochemical and biological processes. Human activities currently release over 30 billion tons of CO2 into the atmosphere every year (Hayhoe, K., et al. 2018). The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) reports that these human-caused emissions are 135 times as much CO2 as volcanoes each year.\nThe Greenhouse Effect is a natural process that occurs when the Sun emits intense amounts of solar radiation, or sunlight. The sunlight is either absorbed by the Earth\u2019s surface and atmosphere or is reflected back into space (Wolff et al. 2020). The absorbed sunlight is trapped close to the Earth\u2019s surface by greenhouse gases. This process acts as a blanket for the planet, stabilizing the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and allowing the planet to stay warm enough to sustain life.\nClimate Change is driven by drastic increases in the concentration of greenhouse gases and other climate pollutants that occur in the atmosphere due to human activities. The Keeling Curve is a measurement of the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere made atop Hawaii\u2019s Mauna Loa since 1958. At the start of the Industrial Revolution, carbon dioxide levels were about 180 parts per million. The average annual carbon dioxide level initially exceeded 400 parts per million in 2016 and continues to rise (Tans and Keeling 2020). An increase in carbon dioxide of this magnitude is expected to result in an unprecedented increase in global temperature. However, exactly how much the average global temperature rises depends how much greenhouse gases are emitted around the globe into the future and how Earth\u2019s climate system responds to this human-induced warming.\nSee the current Keeling Curve, which is updated daily.\nWatch The Museum of Natural History\u2019s video on The Keeling Curve here.\nThank you for your interest in greenhouse gases!\nFor more information on greenhouse gases in New Jersey and climate impacts, please visit:\nHayhoe, K., D.

Content is not being updated or maintained, and some links may no longer work.\nThe modern record of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels began with observations recorded at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. This graph shows the station's monthly average carbon dioxide measurements since 1958 in parts per million (ppm). The seasonal cycle of highs and lows (small peaks and valleys) is driven by Northern Hemisphere summer vegetation growth, which reduces atmospheric carbon dioxide, and winter decay, which increases it. The long-term trend of rising carbon dioxide levels is driven by human activities. At Mauna Loa, the highest monthly value each year occurs in May. In May 2024, carbon dioxide hit just under 427 ppm\u2014a new record. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on Mauna Loa monthly mean data from NOAA Global Monitoring Lab.\nBased on the annual analysis from NOAA\u2019s Global Monitoring Lab, global average atmospheric carbon dioxide was 422.8 parts per million (\u201cppm,\u201d for short) in 2024, a new record high. The increase during 2024 was 3.75 ppm\u2014the largest one-year increase on record. At Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii (graph above), where the modern carbon dioxide record began in 1958, the annual average carbon dioxide in 2024 was 424.61 ppm, also a new record.\nThe years with the largest annual carbon dioxide growth tend to be associated with the strongest El Ni\u00f1os\u2014the warm phase of a natural climate pattern in the tropical Pacific\u2014which lead to high temperatures over land and sea and an expansion of global drought area. In turn, these weather conditions typically lead to less plant growth, which reduces carbon dioxide uptake, as well as increased decomposition of carbon in soil and increased carbon dioxide emissions from forest fires. Together, these impacts cause atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to rise faster than normal.\nEven though the 2023-24 El Ni\u00f1o had waned by April, record high air temperatures and drought in all of 2024, similar to those during an El Nino, were likely drivers of the large increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide in 2024. In addition to other factors, large forest fires in both the Amazon and Canada contributed to the 2024 global increase.\nCarbon dioxide concentrations are rising mostly because of the fossil fuels that people have been burning for energy since the start of the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuels like coal and oil contain the carbon from millions of years of photosynthesis\u2014the process by which plants remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. We are returning that carbon to the atmosphere in just a few hundred years. Since the middle of the 20th century, annual emissions of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels have increased every decade, from close to 11 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year in the 1960s to an estimated 37.4 billion tons in 2024 according to the Global Carbon Budget 2024.\nThe amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (blue line) has increased along with human emissions (gray line) since the start of the Industrial Revolution in 1750. Emissions rose slowly to about 5 gigatons (1 gigaton is 1 billion metric tons per year) in the mid-20th century before rapidly increasing to more than 35 billion tons per year by the end of the century. NOAA Climate.gov graph, adapted from original by Dr. Howard Diamond (NOAA ARL). Atmospheric carbon dioxide data from NOAA and ETHZ. Carbon dioxide emissions data from Our World in Data and the Global Carbon Project.\nCarbon cycle experts estimate that natural \u201csinks,\u201d including plant growth and ocean absorption, remove about half of carbon dioxide humans emit into the atmosphere from fossil fuel burning. The rest stays in the atmosphere. Every year, we are adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than natural sinks can remove, and so the total amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere goes up. The bigger the overshoot, the faster atmospheric carbon dioxide increases.\nIn the 1960s, atmospheric carbon dioxide increased by about 0.8 ppm per year on average. That growth rate doubled to an average of 1.6 ppm per year in the 1980s and 1.5 ppm per year in the 1990s. In the last decade (2015-2024), the annual increase has accelerated to 2.6 ppm per year. As a result, the annual rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide over the past 60 years is 100-200 times faster than the increase that occurred at the end of the last ice age 11,000-17,000 years ago.\nCarbon dioxide is Earth\u2019s most important long-lived greenhouse gas: a gas that absorbs and radiates heat. Unlike oxygen or nitrogen (which make up most of Earth's atmosphere), greenhouse gases absorb heat radiating from the Earth\u2019s surface and re-release it in all directions\u2014including back toward Earth\u2019s surface. Without any carbon dioxide, Earth\u2019s natural greenhouse effect would be too weak to keep the average global surface temperature above freezing.\nBy adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, people are amplifying the natural greenhouse effect, causing global temperature to rise. According to observations and analysis by the NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory, carbon dioxide alone is responsible for about 80 percent of the total heating influence of all human-produced greenhouse gases since 1990.\nAnother reason carbon dioxide is important in the Earth system is that it dissolves into the ocean like the fizz in a can of soda. It reacts with water molecules, producing carbonic acid and lowering the ocean's pH (raising its acidity). Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, the pH of the ocean's surface waters has dropped from 8.21 to 8.10. This drop in pH is called ocean acidification, and it interferes with the ability of marine life to extract calcium from sea water to build skeletons and shells.\n(left) A healthy ocean snail has a transparent shell with smoothly contoured ridges.

Since carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, this increase has warmed the planet.\n430ppm\nJune 2025\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) is an important greenhouse gas. Greenhouse gases trap the heat from sunlight, warming the planet. Without any greenhouse gases, Earth would be too cold to support life. But the more greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere, the warmer the planet becomes.\nCarbon dioxide comes from sources such as the burning of fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, and natural gas), wildfires, and volcanic eruptions. The graph shows atmospheric CO2 levels measured by NOAA at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, since 1958. It's important to note that \u201cparts per million\u201d refers to the number of carbon dioxide molecules per million molecules of dry air. The data shown are the latest available, updated monthly.\nThe second animated graph shows CO2 levels from an Antarctic ice core in combination with the observations from Mauna Loa Observatory. This extends the record back through Earth\u2019s last three glacial cycles. The Antarctic ice core measures CO2 levels trapped in tiny air bubbles from the past that were preserved when the ice formed.\nGround-based and satellite measurements have measured a sharp increase in atmospheric CO2 in recent decades. With a more than 50% increase in CO2 since the start of industrial times in the 18th century, scientific measurements have linked this increase primarily to the burning of coal, oil, and gas. This means that CO2 levels are now 150% the value they were at in 1750 \u2014 this is at least 1.5 times greater than the natural increase observed at the end of the last ice age 20,000 years ago, which happened over thousands of years.\nThe animated map below shows the historical changes in global carbon dioxide over time. Note the colors change as the amount of CO2 rises from 365 parts per million (ppm) in 2002 to over 420 ppm in 2022. These measurements from the AIRS instrument come from the mid-troposphere, the layer of Earth's atmosphere that is 8 to 12 kilometers (about 5 to 7 miles) above the ground.\nA closer look at the carbon dioxide measurements at Mauna Loa shows a series of wiggles in the data. Although total CO2 is increasing each year, there is also a short-term cycle visible within the larger trend.\nThis annual rise and fall of CO2 levels is caused by seasonal cycles in photosynthesis on a global scale. In Northern Hemisphere spring, plants come to life and draw in CO2 to fuel their growth. This begins the process of lowering the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. In northern autumn, plant growth stops or slows down, and the whole process reverses itself. Much of the plant matter decomposes, releasing CO2 back to the atmosphere.\nA similar but less intense pattern repeats in the Southern Hemisphere in opposite seasons. Spring growth starts in September and winter decomposition begins in March, so CO2 records in the Southern Hemisphere show the opposite pattern of that seen in Mauna Loa. However, because there is a lot more land and vegetation in the Northern Hemisphere than the southern, the global yearly cycle more closely aligns with the northern seasons.\nSee the cycle in action in the visualization Watching Earth Breathe: The Seasonal Vegetation Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide.\nThis cycle of plant growth gives the graph of CO2 a sawtooth pattern of ups and downs from year to year. At a larger scale, the upward climb of the trend line over the decades is caused by CO2 emissions, primarily from burning fossil fuels. Thus, the data illustrate both natural factors and human additions of CO2.\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This graph shows the station's monthly average carbon dioxide measurements since 1958 in parts per million (ppm). The seasonal cycle of highs and lows (small peaks and valleys) is driven by Northern Hemisphere summer vegetation growth, which reduces atmospheric carbon dioxide, and winter decay, which increases it. The long-term trend of rising carbon dioxide levels is driven by human activities. At Mauna Loa, the highest monthly value each year occurs in May. In May 2024, carbon dioxide hit just under 427 ppm\u2014a new record. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on Mauna Loa monthly mean data from NOAA Global Monitoring Lab.\nBased on the annual analysis from NOAA\u2019s Global Monitoring Lab, global average atmospheric carbon dioxide was 422.8 parts per million (\u201cppm,\u201d for short) in 2024, a new record high. The increase during 2024 was 3.75 ppm\u2014the largest one-year increase on record. At Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii (graph above), where the modern carbon dioxide record began in 1958, the annual average carbon dioxide in 2024 was 424.61 ppm, also a new record.\nThe years with the largest annual carbon dioxide growth tend to be associated with the strongest El Ni\u00f1os\u2014the warm phase of a natural climate pattern in the tropical Pacific\u2014which lead to high temperatures over land and sea and an expansion of global drought area. In turn, these weather conditions typically lead to less plant growth, which reduces carbon dioxide uptake, as well as increased decomposition of carbon in soil and increased carbon dioxide emissions from forest fires. Together, these impacts cause atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to rise faster than normal.\nEven though the 2023-24 El Ni\u00f1o had waned by April, record high air temperatures and drought in all of 2024, similar to those during an El Nino, were likely drivers of the large increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide in 2024. In addition to other factors, large forest fires in both the Amazon and Canada contributed to the 2024 global increase.\nCarbon dioxide concentrations are rising mostly because of the fossil fuels that people have been burning for energy since the start of the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuels like coal and oil contain the carbon from millions of years of photosynthesis\u2014the process by which plants remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. We are returning that carbon to the atmosphere in just a few hundred years. Since the middle of the 20th century, annual emissions of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels have increased every decade, from close to 11 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year in the 1960s to an estimated 37.4 billion tons in 2024 according to the Global Carbon Budget 2024.\nThe amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (blue line) has increased along with human emissions (gray line) since the start of the Industrial Revolution in 1750. Emissions rose slowly to about 5 gigatons (1 gigaton is 1 billion metric tons per year) in the mid-20th century before rapidly increasing to more than 35 billion tons per year by the end of the century. NOAA Climate.gov graph, adapted from original by Dr. Howard Diamond (NOAA ARL). Atmospheric carbon dioxide data from NOAA and ETHZ. Carbon dioxide emissions data from Our World in Data and the Global Carbon Project.\nCarbon cycle experts estimate that natural \u201csinks,\u201d including plant growth and ocean absorption, remove about half of carbon dioxide humans emit into the atmosphere from fossil fuel burning. The rest stays in the atmosphere. Every year, we are adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than natural sinks can remove, and so the total amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere goes up. The bigger the overshoot, the faster atmospheric carbon dioxide increases.\nIn the 1960s, atmospheric carbon dioxide increased by about 0.8 ppm per year on average. That growth rate doubled to an average of 1.6 ppm per year in the 1980s and 1.5 ppm per year in the 1990s. In the last decade (2015-2024), the annual increase has accelerated to 2.6 ppm per year. As a result, the annual rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide over the past 60 years is 100-200 times faster than the increase that occurred at the end of the last ice age 11,000-17,000 years ago.\nCarbon dioxide is Earth\u2019s most important long-lived greenhouse gas: a gas that absorbs and radiates heat. Unlike oxygen or nitrogen (which make up most of Earth's atmosphere), greenhouse gases absorb heat radiating from the Earth\u2019s surface and re-release it in all directions\u2014including back toward Earth\u2019s surface. Without any carbon dioxide, Earth\u2019s natural greenhouse effect would be too weak to keep the average global surface temperature above freezing.\nBy adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, people are amplifying the natural greenhouse effect, causing global temperature to rise. According to observations and analysis by the NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory, carbon dioxide alone is responsible for about 80 percent of the total heating influence of all human-produced greenhouse gases since 1990.\nAnother reason carbon dioxide is important in the Earth system is that it dissolves into the ocean like the fizz in a can of soda. It reacts with water molecules, producing carbonic acid and lowering the ocean's pH (raising its acidity). Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, the pH of the ocean's surface waters has dropped from 8.21 to 8.10. This drop in pH is called ocean acidification, and it interferes with the ability of marine life to extract calcium from sea water to build skeletons and shells.\n(left) A healthy ocean snail has a transparent shell with smoothly contoured ridges.

This section provides information on emissions and removals of the main greenhouse gases.\n\nFull Page Content:\nGreenhouse gases trap heat in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The gases let sunlight pass through, but they prevent heat from leaving the atmosphere. Naturally occurring greenhouse gases are needed to sustain life on Earth, and are in fact, one of the reasons life on Earth is even possible. However, human activities are emitting greenhouse gas concentrations that are far above what naturally occurs. This has and will continue to drive and accelerate change to the global climate and alter the way humans and all life on Earth will interact and exist on the planet.\nGreenhouse gases (GHGs) are those gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, such as:\nExcept for the fluorinated gases, these gases are emitted from both natural and human activities.\nAnother pollutant that contributes to climate change is black carbon (BC), which is not a gas, but is a component of particulate matter. Black carbon forms through the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, biofuel, and biomass.\nWhile all greenhouse gases warm the Earth by absorbing energy and slowing the rate at which that energy escapes to space, different greenhouse gases have different effects on the Earth\u2019s warming. Two key ways in which these gases differ from each other are their ability to absorb energy (their radiative efficiency), and how long they stay in the atmosphere (their lifetime).\nGlobal Warming Potential (GWP) allows direct comparisons of the global warming impacts of the different greenhouse gases. Specifically, it\u2019s a measure of how much energy the emissions of 1 ton of a gas will absorb over a given time relative to the emissions of 1 ton of CO2. The larger the GWP, the more that a given greenhouse gas warms the Earth comparted to CO2. The GWP referenced on this page is based on a 100-year scale (GWP100).\nCarbon Dioxide (CO2) is the primary greenhouse gas contributing to climate change. CO2 is naturally present in the atmosphere as part of the global carbon cycle, which is the process of natural circulation of carbon through plant and animal respiration, volcanic eruptions, and ocean-atmosphere exchange.\nAtmospheric CO2 concentrations have increased by more than 40% since pre-industrial times, from approximately 280 parts per million by volume (ppmv) in the 18th century to over 400 ppmv in 2015. This has impacted the carbon cycle, affecting the natural cycles that maintain the Earth\u2019s geochemical and biological processes. Human activities currently release over 30 billion tons of CO2 into the atmosphere every year (Hayhoe, K., et al. 2018). The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) reports that these human-caused emissions are 135 times as much CO2 as volcanoes each year.\nThe Greenhouse Effect is a natural process that occurs when the Sun emits intense amounts of solar radiation, or sunlight. The sunlight is either absorbed by the Earth\u2019s surface and atmosphere or is reflected back into space (Wolff et al. 2020). The absorbed sunlight is trapped close to the Earth\u2019s surface by greenhouse gases. This process acts as a blanket for the planet, stabilizing the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and allowing the planet to stay warm enough to sustain life.\nClimate Change is driven by drastic increases in the concentration of greenhouse gases and other climate pollutants that occur in the atmosphere due to human activities. The Keeling Curve is a measurement of the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere made atop Hawaii\u2019s Mauna Loa since 1958. At the start of the Industrial Revolution, carbon dioxide levels were about 180 parts per million. The average annual carbon dioxide level initially exceeded 400 parts per million in 2016 and continues to rise (Tans and Keeling 2020). An increase in carbon dioxide of this magnitude is expected to result in an unprecedented increase in global temperature. However, exactly how much the average global temperature rises depends how much greenhouse gases are emitted around the globe into the future and how Earth\u2019s climate system responds to this human-induced warming.\nSee the current Keeling Curve, which is updated daily.\nWatch The Museum of Natural History\u2019s video on The Keeling Curve here.\nThank you for your interest in greenhouse gases!\nFor more information on greenhouse gases in New Jersey and climate impacts, please visit:\nHayhoe, K., D.

The gases let sunlight pass through, but they prevent heat from leaving the atmosphere. Naturally occurring greenhouse gases are needed to sustain life on Earth, and are in fact, one of the reasons life on Earth is even possible. However, human activities are emitting greenhouse gas concentrations that are far above what naturally occurs. This has and will continue to drive and accelerate change to the global climate and alter the way humans and all life on Earth will interact and exist on the planet.\nGreenhouse gases (GHGs) are those gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, such as:\nExcept for the fluorinated gases, these gases are emitted from both natural and human activities.\nAnother pollutant that contributes to climate change is black carbon (BC), which is not a gas, but is a component of particulate matter. Black carbon forms through the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, biofuel, and biomass.\nWhile all greenhouse gases warm the Earth by absorbing energy and slowing the rate at which that energy escapes to space, different greenhouse gases have different effects on the Earth\u2019s warming. Two key ways in which these gases differ from each other are their ability to absorb energy (their radiative efficiency), and how long they stay in the atmosphere (their lifetime).\nGlobal Warming Potential (GWP) allows direct comparisons of the global warming impacts of the different greenhouse gases. Specifically, it\u2019s a measure of how much energy the emissions of 1 ton of a gas will absorb over a given time relative to the emissions of 1 ton of CO2. The larger the GWP, the more that a given greenhouse gas warms the Earth comparted to CO2. The GWP referenced on this page is based on a 100-year scale (GWP100).\nCarbon Dioxide (CO2) is the primary greenhouse gas contributing to climate change. CO2 is naturally present in the atmosphere as part of the global carbon cycle, which is the process of natural circulation of carbon through plant and animal respiration, volcanic eruptions, and ocean-atmosphere exchange.\nAtmospheric CO2 concentrations have increased by more than 40% since pre-industrial times, from approximately 280 parts per million by volume (ppmv) in the 18th century to over 400 ppmv in 2015. This has impacted the carbon cycle, affecting the natural cycles that maintain the Earth\u2019s geochemical and biological processes. Human activities currently release over 30 billion tons of CO2 into the atmosphere every year (Hayhoe, K., et al. 2018). The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) reports that these human-caused emissions are 135 times as much CO2 as volcanoes each year.\nThe Greenhouse Effect is a natural process that occurs when the Sun emits intense amounts of solar radiation, or sunlight. The sunlight is either absorbed by the Earth\u2019s surface and atmosphere or is reflected back into space (Wolff et al. 2020). The absorbed sunlight is trapped close to the Earth\u2019s surface by greenhouse gases. This process acts as a blanket for the planet, stabilizing the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and allowing the planet to stay warm enough to sustain life.\nClimate Change is driven by drastic increases in the concentration of greenhouse gases and other climate pollutants that occur in the atmosphere due to human activities. The Keeling Curve is a measurement of the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere made atop Hawaii\u2019s Mauna Loa since 1958. At the start of the Industrial Revolution, carbon dioxide levels were about 180 parts per million. The average annual carbon dioxide level initially exceeded 400 parts per million in 2016 and continues to rise (Tans and Keeling 2020). An increase in carbon dioxide of this magnitude is expected to result in an unprecedented increase in global temperature. However, exactly how much the average global temperature rises depends how much greenhouse gases are emitted around the globe into the future and how Earth\u2019s climate system responds to this human-induced warming.\nSee the current Keeling Curve, which is updated daily.\nWatch The Museum of Natural History\u2019s video on The Keeling Curve here.\nThank you for your interest in greenhouse gases!\nFor more information on greenhouse gases in New Jersey and climate impacts, please visit:\nHayhoe, K., D.

Since carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, this increase has warmed the planet.\n430ppm\nJune 2025\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) is an important greenhouse gas. Greenhouse gases trap the heat from sunlight, warming the planet. Without any greenhouse gases, Earth would be too cold to support life. But the more greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere, the warmer the planet becomes.\nCarbon dioxide comes from sources such as the burning of fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, and natural gas), wildfires, and volcanic eruptions. The graph shows atmospheric CO2 levels measured by NOAA at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, since 1958. It's important to note that \u201cparts per million\u201d refers to the number of carbon dioxide molecules per million molecules of dry air. The data shown are the latest available, updated monthly.\nThe second animated graph shows CO2 levels from an Antarctic ice core in combination with the observations from Mauna Loa Observatory. This extends the record back through Earth\u2019s last three glacial cycles. The Antarctic ice core measures CO2 levels trapped in tiny air bubbles from the past that were preserved when the ice formed.\nGround-based and satellite measurements have measured a sharp increase in atmospheric CO2 in recent decades. With a more than 50% increase in CO2 since the start of industrial times in the 18th century, scientific measurements have linked this increase primarily to the burning of coal, oil, and gas. This means that CO2 levels are now 150% the value they were at in 1750 \u2014 this is at least 1.5 times greater than the natural increase observed at the end of the last ice age 20,000 years ago, which happened over thousands of years.\nThe animated map below shows the historical changes in global carbon dioxide over time. Note the colors change as the amount of CO2 rises from 365 parts per million (ppm) in 2002 to over 420 ppm in 2022. These measurements from the AIRS instrument come from the mid-troposphere, the layer of Earth's atmosphere that is 8 to 12 kilometers (about 5 to 7 miles) above the ground.\nA closer look at the carbon dioxide measurements at Mauna Loa shows a series of wiggles in the data. Although total CO2 is increasing each year, there is also a short-term cycle visible within the larger trend.\nThis annual rise and fall of CO2 levels is caused by seasonal cycles in photosynthesis on a global scale. In Northern Hemisphere spring, plants come to life and draw in CO2 to fuel their growth. This begins the process of lowering the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. In northern autumn, plant growth stops or slows down, and the whole process reverses itself. Much of the plant matter decomposes, releasing CO2 back to the atmosphere.\nA similar but less intense pattern repeats in the Southern Hemisphere in opposite seasons. Spring growth starts in September and winter decomposition begins in March, so CO2 records in the Southern Hemisphere show the opposite pattern of that seen in Mauna Loa. However, because there is a lot more land and vegetation in the Northern Hemisphere than the southern, the global yearly cycle more closely aligns with the northern seasons.\nSee the cycle in action in the visualization Watching Earth Breathe: The Seasonal Vegetation Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide.\nThis cycle of plant growth gives the graph of CO2 a sawtooth pattern of ups and downs from year to year. At a larger scale, the upward climb of the trend line over the decades is caused by CO2 emissions, primarily from burning fossil fuels. Thus, the data illustrate both natural factors and human additions of CO2.\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Heavy losses that year also resulted from severe weather, floods, and a winter storm in the United States. A mixture of snowmelt triggered by unusually high temperatures in March and storms with torrential rain led to sustained and extensive flooding in Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, and Mississippi (49).\nOverall, the numbers and costs of disasters have been increasing for several decades due to increases in exposure (more people moving into harm\u2019s way and increases in the values of property and infrastructure at risk), vulnerability of people and infrastructure, and climate change (170).

Although total CO2 is increasing each year, there is also a short-term cycle visible within the larger trend.\nThis annual rise and fall of CO2 levels is caused by seasonal cycles in photosynthesis on a global scale. In Northern Hemisphere spring, plants come to life and draw in CO2 to fuel their growth. This begins the process of lowering the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. In northern autumn, plant growth stops or slows down, and the whole process reverses itself. Much of the plant matter decomposes, releasing CO2 back to the atmosphere.\nA similar but less intense pattern repeats in the Southern Hemisphere in opposite seasons. Spring growth starts in September and winter decomposition begins in March, so CO2 records in the Southern Hemisphere show the opposite pattern of that seen in Mauna Loa. However, because there is a lot more land and vegetation in the Northern Hemisphere than the southern, the global yearly cycle more closely aligns with the northern seasons.\nSee the cycle in action in the visualization Watching Earth Breathe: The Seasonal Vegetation Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide.\nThis cycle of plant growth gives the graph of CO2 a sawtooth pattern of ups and downs from year to year. At a larger scale, the upward climb of the trend line over the decades is caused by CO2 emissions, primarily from burning fossil fuels. Thus, the data illustrate both natural factors and human additions of CO2.\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Although adverse health impacts from extreme events declined over the past few decades, climate change and more people moving into harm\u2019s way could alter this trend. Long-term changes to Earth\u2019s energy balance are increasing the frequency and intensity of many extreme events and the probability of compound events, with trends projected to accelerate under certain greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. While most of these events cannot be completely avoided, many of the health risks could be prevented through building climate-resilient health systems with improved risk reduction, preparation, response, and recovery. Conducting vulnerability and adaptation assessments and developing health system adaptation plans can identify priority actions to effectively reduce risks, such as disaster risk management and more resilient infrastructure. The risks are urgent, so action is needed now.\nKeywords: climate change, climate variability, extreme events, population health, health systems\nWorldwide, in 2019, there were 396 disasters1 that killed 11,755 people, affected 95 million others, and cost nearly US$130 billion (28). Asia was the most affected continent with 40% of the events, 45% of the deaths, and 74% of all people affected. Floods and storms accounted for 68% of the number of affected people worldwide. Anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, land use change, and other activities impacting the global energy balance are altering the frequency and intensity of many extreme weather and climate events, with some regions experiencing increases in heat waves, floods, and droughts (84). Events influenced by climate change, particularly wildfires, also are increasing.\nRisks from extreme weather and climate events arise from the intersection of the physical hazard (e.g., wind and rain), the extent of exposure to the hazard, the vulnerability of individuals and communities, and the capacity to prepare for, manage, and recover from extreme events.\nA disaster generally is defined as a sudden, calamitous event that disrupts the functioning of a community or society and that exceeds its ability to cope using its own resources (81). The occurrence of an extreme event is not required for a community or region to experience extreme impacts, such as large increase in mortality; an extreme impact can arise from a moderately strong event when it occurs in a highly vulnerable population. The converse also is true, that an extreme event may not result in extreme impacts when communities are prepared.\nRoughly 20% of disasters in 2019 occurred in North America, including the Caribbean and Central America, for total damages of US$55 billion, of which US$29 billion were insured (130). Loss events included Hurricane Dorian, which caused billions of dollars in damage, especially in the Bahamas, in late August to early September. Heavy losses that year also resulted from severe weather, floods, and a winter storm in the United States. A mixture of snowmelt triggered by unusually high temperatures in March and storms with torrential rain led to sustained and extensive flooding in Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, and Mississippi (49).\nOverall, the numbers and costs of disasters have been increasing for several decades due to increases in exposure (more people moving into harm\u2019s way and increases in the values of property and infrastructure at risk), vulnerability of people and infrastructure, and climate change (170). Since 1980, the United States has experienced 265 weather and climate disasters in which the overall damages reached or exceeded US$1 billion; the total costs were greater than US$1.775 trillion (132), with an estimated 14,223 deaths (an average of 356 per year), although the numbers of deaths are likely an underestimate (178).\nBeyond the damage to infrastructure, extreme weather events and disasters can affect the health and well-being of individuals and can have catastrophic impacts on communities and health systems. People can suffer from a wide range of physical effects (e.g., heat exhaustion, injuries in severe storms, and respiratory illnesses from molds due to floods) as well as longer-term impacts on mental health. Health systems and facilities can be affected by impacts on patients and health care staff, medical and nonmedical supplies, facility operations, and critical infrastructures. To prepare for climate change, health-sector and emergency-management officials\u2014as well as urban planners, neighborhood services staff, and others\u2014require information about how hazards are projected to change, possible future exposures of people and property, likely changes in population health and health care infrastructure vulnerabilities, and needed capacities to prepare for and manage the events and their aftermath.\nWe review (a) the current impacts and projected risks of climate change on the health of populations and health systems from extreme weather and climate events and from wildfires, (b) the value of disaster management to reduce health risks from these changes, and (c) adaptation and mitigation measures that can explicitly address climate change in policies and planning processes.\nGlobal land surface air temperature has risen 1.53\u00b0C since the preindustrial period of 1850\u20131900, with considerable variation in regional warming; this increase is much larger than the observed warming combined over land and oceans (0.87\u00b0C) (84).

A warmer and ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nNatural hazardsArticle3. Mai 20246 Min. Lesedauer\nThe world is heating up. Last year, 2023 registered the warmest year since global records began in 1850 at 1.18\u00b0C (2.12\u00b0F) above the 20th-century average of 13.9\u00b0C (57\u00b0F). According to scientists from NOAA\u2019s National Centers for Environmental Information, this is 0.15\u00b0C (0.27\u00b0F) above the previous record set in 2016. In fact, the 10 warmest years since 1850 have all occurred during the last decade.\nBut is this change in climate causing more extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, floods, wildfires and heat waves?\nAccording to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) , \u201cclimate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe.\u201d But it is difficult to gauge the precise impact of climate change on specific extreme weather events as John Scott, Head of Sustainability Risk for Zurich Insurance Group (Zurich), explains.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a complex task to disentangle the natural variations in extreme weather from the effects of climate change. While some climate change impacts are already obvious, such as retreating glaciers and sea level rise from melting land ice, the impact on today\u2019s weather is harder to interpret,\u201d Scott says.\nAttributing extreme weather to climate change\nLearn how Zurich\u2019s PERC analysis is helping us to better understand the impact of extreme weather events.\nWhether climate change has made an extreme weather event more likely or not is subject to a growing field of research known as climate attribution science. As a result of this research, meteorologists and climate scientists are beginning to understand how prolonged periods of heat and cold can be closely attributable to ongoing global warming. For instance, rising surface temperatures on land are connected to the likelihood and severity of droughts and wildfires in hot, arid regions.\nBut what about windstorms? Rising temperatures and warmer seas mean more water vapor evaporates into the atmosphere, providing fuel for hurricanes and torrential rain. A warmer and moister atmosphere \u2013 combined with warmer oceans \u2013 increases the impact of tropical cyclones, for instance, becoming more intense, producing more rainfall, affecting new areas, and becoming larger and longer-lived.\n\u201cWe can see now from the empirical data that tropical cyclones are behaving differently,\u201d adds Scott. \u201cThey are going further inland where they then become rainstorm and flooding events. They also dump a lot more rain on the land because they\u2019ve picked up more water \u2013 due to global warming \u2013 while they\u2019ve been over the ocean.\u201d\nAccording to Scott, these natural hazards should alert more people to the fact that global warming is not just causing a steady rise in average temperatures. \u201cMost people don\u2019t fully understand the impact of climate change,\u201d Scott says. \u201cThey hear the phrase \u2018global warming\u2019 and think, \u2018Oh, everything is just getting a bit warmer,\u2019 but it\u2019s more complex than that.\nRelated article\nMadrid\u2019s battle against extreme heat: How Zurich is helping enhance the city\u2019s climate resilience\n\u201cThere is evidence that the changing climate is influencing the behavior of the jet stream, which has the effect of localizing weather systems for weeks at a time, causing prolonged rainfall, drought, frost or heat,\u201d explains Scott. \u201cMost climate scientists agree that over time, climate change will exacerbate chaotic severe weather events.\n\u201cTropical storms will likely become more impactful, with higher wind speeds and greater aerial extent,\u201d adds Scott. \u201cThey are likely to change their typical paths and become extra tropical storms or rainstorm flooding events when they eventually hit land. However, the evidence for an increase in the number of tropical cyclones is not clear and no existing scientific theory predicts greater tropical cyclone frequency. Climate scientists are currently investigating promising studies of weaker disturbances that sometimes strengthen into cyclones, to gain greater insights into this aspect of severe weather systems.\u201d\nThe need for climate resilience\nUnfortunately, there is no quick fix for climate change. Even if the global community meets the 2015 Paris Agreement targets and restricts global warming to well below 2\u00b0C, and ideally to 1.5\u00b0C, communities will still feel the impact of climate change for decades to come. This means that while we tackle the causes of global warming, we also need to minimize its impact. This approach is known as climate resilience.\nContact\n\u201cWhen we talk about climate change, we define the risk it presents in three dimensions: hazard, exposure and controls,\u201d says Amar Rahman, Global Head of Climate & Sustainability Solutions at Zurich Resilience Solutions.\n\u201cPeople usually focus on the hazard: there\u2019s more rain, more wind, more heat,\u201d Rahman explains. \u201cBut we develop models and scenarios to help them understand their exposure to those hazards, to identify their vulnerabilities or pain points. Finally, we assess the controls: what can you do to reduce and manage the impact of climate change right now? Climate resilience is about managing those three factors with the tools we have, and not waiting for new data or government regulation before you act. Because if you wait, it will be too late to develop solutions.\u201d\nOne problem, one planet\nWhen confronted by such a complex, long-term and wide-ranging crisis, it can be hard to know what to do and where to start. Severe flooding, heat waves or blazing wildfires can feel like irresistible forces of nature beyond our individual control. Rahman, however, argues that you can adopt climate resilience as a personal strategy too.\n\u201cThe solution should not only be driven by governments, businesses and global organizations. It needs to also be spearheaded by us, as individuals, by changing our behavior as consumers and voters.\u201d\nRelated article\nThere could be 1.2 billion climate refugees by 2050.

Record-breaking heat waves on land and in the ocean, drenching rains, severe ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nExtreme weather and climate events, such as heat waves, cyclones, and floods, are an expression of climate variability. These events and events influenced by climate change, such as wildfires, continue to cause significant human morbidity and mortality and adversely affect mental health and well-being. Although adverse health impacts from extreme events declined over the past few decades, climate change and more people moving into harm\u2019s way could alter this trend. Long-term changes to Earth\u2019s energy balance are increasing the frequency and intensity of many extreme events and the probability of compound events, with trends projected to accelerate under certain greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. While most of these events cannot be completely avoided, many of the health risks could be prevented through building climate-resilient health systems with improved risk reduction, preparation, response, and recovery. Conducting vulnerability and adaptation assessments and developing health system adaptation plans can identify priority actions to effectively reduce risks, such as disaster risk management and more resilient infrastructure. The risks are urgent, so action is needed now.\nKeywords: climate change, climate variability, extreme events, population health, health systems\nWorldwide, in 2019, there were 396 disasters1 that killed 11,755 people, affected 95 million others, and cost nearly US$130 billion (28). Asia was the most affected continent with 40% of the events, 45% of the deaths, and 74% of all people affected. Floods and storms accounted for 68% of the number of affected people worldwide. Anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, land use change, and other activities impacting the global energy balance are altering the frequency and intensity of many extreme weather and climate events, with some regions experiencing increases in heat waves, floods, and droughts (84). Events influenced by climate change, particularly wildfires, also are increasing.\nRisks from extreme weather and climate events arise from the intersection of the physical hazard (e.g., wind and rain), the extent of exposure to the hazard, the vulnerability of individuals and communities, and the capacity to prepare for, manage, and recover from extreme events.\nA disaster generally is defined as a sudden, calamitous event that disrupts the functioning of a community or society and that exceeds its ability to cope using its own resources (81). The occurrence of an extreme event is not required for a community or region to experience extreme impacts, such as large increase in mortality; an extreme impact can arise from a moderately strong event when it occurs in a highly vulnerable population. The converse also is true, that an extreme event may not result in extreme impacts when communities are prepared.\nRoughly 20% of disasters in 2019 occurred in North America, including the Caribbean and Central America, for total damages of US$55 billion, of which US$29 billion were insured (130). Loss events included Hurricane Dorian, which caused billions of dollars in damage, especially in the Bahamas, in late August to early September. Heavy losses that year also resulted from severe weather, floods, and a winter storm in the United States. A mixture of snowmelt triggered by unusually high temperatures in March and storms with torrential rain led to sustained and extensive flooding in Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, and Mississippi (49).\nOverall, the numbers and costs of disasters have been increasing for several decades due to increases in exposure (more people moving into harm\u2019s way and increases in the values of property and infrastructure at risk), vulnerability of people and infrastructure, and climate change (170). Since 1980, the United States has experienced 265 weather and climate disasters in which the overall damages reached or exceeded US$1 billion; the total costs were greater than US$1.775 trillion (132), with an estimated 14,223 deaths (an average of 356 per year), although the numbers of deaths are likely an underestimate (178).\nBeyond the damage to infrastructure, extreme weather events and disasters can affect the health and well-being of individuals and can have catastrophic impacts on communities and health systems.

The ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nThere is unequivocal evidence that Earth is warming at an unprecedented rate. Human activity is the principal cause.\nEarth's climate has changed throughout history. Just in the last 800,000 years, there have been eight cycles of ice ages and warmer periods, with the end of the last ice age about 11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era \u2014 and of human civilization. Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth\u2019s orbit that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives.\nThe current warming trend is different because it is clearly the result of human activities since the mid-1800s, and is proceeding at a rate not seen over many recent millennia.1 It is undeniable that human activities have produced the atmospheric gases that have trapped more of the Sun\u2019s energy in the Earth system. This extra energy has warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land, and widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred.\nEarth-orbiting satellites and new technologies have helped scientists see the big picture, collecting many different types of information about our planet and its climate all over the world. These data, collected over many years, reveal the signs and patterns of a changing climate.\nScientists demonstrated the heat-trapping nature of carbon dioxide and other gases in the mid-19th century.2 Many of the science instruments NASA uses to study our climate focus on how these gases affect the movement of infrared radiation through the atmosphere. From the measured impacts of increases in these gases, there is no question that increased greenhouse gas levels warm Earth in response.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nIce cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that Earth\u2019s climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly 10 times faster than the average rate of warming after an ice age. Carbon dioxide from human activities is increasing about 250 times faster than it did from natural sources after the last Ice Age.3\nThe planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and other human activities.4 Most of the warming occurred in the past 40 years, with the seven most recent years being the warmest. The years 2016 and 2020 are tied for the warmest year on record.5 Image credit: Ashwin Kumar, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic.\nThe ocean has absorbed much of this increased heat, with the top 100 meters (about 328 feet) of ocean showing warming of 0.67 degrees Fahrenheit (0.33 degrees Celsius) since 1969.6 Earth stores 90% of the extra energy in the ocean. Image credit: Kelsey Roberts/USGS\nThe Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass. Data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment show Greenland lost an average of 279 billion tons of ice per year between 1993 and 2019, while Antarctica lost about 148 billion tons of ice per year.7 Image: The Antarctic Peninsula, Credit: NASA\nGlaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world \u2014 including in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska, and Africa.8 Image: Miles Glacier, Alaska Image credit: NASA\nSatellite observations reveal that the amount of spring snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere has decreased over the past five decades and the snow is melting earlier.9 Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\nGlobal sea level rose about 8 inches (20 centimeters) in the last century.

These events and events influenced by climate change, such as wildfires, continue to cause significant human morbidity and mortality and adversely affect mental health and well-being. Although adverse health impacts from extreme events declined over the past few decades, climate change and more people moving into harm\u2019s way could alter this trend. Long-term changes to Earth\u2019s energy balance are increasing the frequency and intensity of many extreme events and the probability of compound events, with trends projected to accelerate under certain greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. While most of these events cannot be completely avoided, many of the health risks could be prevented through building climate-resilient health systems with improved risk reduction, preparation, response, and recovery. Conducting vulnerability and adaptation assessments and developing health system adaptation plans can identify priority actions to effectively reduce risks, such as disaster risk management and more resilient infrastructure. The risks are urgent, so action is needed now.\nKeywords: climate change, climate variability, extreme events, population health, health systems\nWorldwide, in 2019, there were 396 disasters1 that killed 11,755 people, affected 95 million others, and cost nearly US$130 billion (28). Asia was the most affected continent with 40% of the events, 45% of the deaths, and 74% of all people affected. Floods and storms accounted for 68% of the number of affected people worldwide. Anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, land use change, and other activities impacting the global energy balance are altering the frequency and intensity of many extreme weather and climate events, with some regions experiencing increases in heat waves, floods, and droughts (84). Events influenced by climate change, particularly wildfires, also are increasing.\nRisks from extreme weather and climate events arise from the intersection of the physical hazard (e.g., wind and rain), the extent of exposure to the hazard, the vulnerability of individuals and communities, and the capacity to prepare for, manage, and recover from extreme events.\nA disaster generally is defined as a sudden, calamitous event that disrupts the functioning of a community or society and that exceeds its ability to cope using its own resources (81). The occurrence of an extreme event is not required for a community or region to experience extreme impacts, such as large increase in mortality; an extreme impact can arise from a moderately strong event when it occurs in a highly vulnerable population. The converse also is true, that an extreme event may not result in extreme impacts when communities are prepared.\nRoughly 20% of disasters in 2019 occurred in North America, including the Caribbean and Central America, for total damages of US$55 billion, of which US$29 billion were insured (130). Loss events included Hurricane Dorian, which caused billions of dollars in damage, especially in the Bahamas, in late August to early September. Heavy losses that year also resulted from severe weather, floods, and a winter storm in the United States. A mixture of snowmelt triggered by unusually high temperatures in March and storms with torrential rain led to sustained and extensive flooding in Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, and Mississippi (49).\nOverall, the numbers and costs of disasters have been increasing for several decades due to increases in exposure (more people moving into harm\u2019s way and increases in the values of property and infrastructure at risk), vulnerability of people and infrastructure, and climate change (170). Since 1980, the United States has experienced 265 weather and climate disasters in which the overall damages reached or exceeded US$1 billion; the total costs were greater than US$1.775 trillion (132), with an estimated 14,223 deaths (an average of 356 per year), although the numbers of deaths are likely an underestimate (178).\nBeyond the damage to infrastructure, extreme weather events and disasters can affect the health and well-being of individuals and can have catastrophic impacts on communities and health systems. People can suffer from a wide range of physical effects (e.g., heat exhaustion, injuries in severe storms, and respiratory illnesses from molds due to floods) as well as longer-term impacts on mental health. Health systems and facilities can be affected by impacts on patients and health care staff, medical and nonmedical supplies, facility operations, and critical infrastructures.

Such shifts can be natural, due to changes in the sun\u2019s activity or large volcanic eruptions. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.\nBurning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun\u2019s heat and raising temperatures.\nThe main greenhouse gases that are causing climate change include carbon dioxide and methane. These come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example. Clearing land and cutting down forests can also release carbon dioxide. Agriculture, oil and gas operations are major sources of methane emissions. Energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main sectors causing greenhouse gases.\nClimate scientists have showed that humans are responsible for virtually all global heating over the last 200 years. Human activities like the ones mentioned above are causing greenhouse gases that are warming the world faster than at any time in at least the last two thousand years.\nThe average temperature of the Earth\u2019s surface is now about 1.42\u00b0C warmer than it was in the late 1800s-prior to the industrial revolution-and warmer than at any time in the last 100,000 years. The last decade (2015-2024) was the warmest on record, and each of the last four decades has been warmer than any previous decade since 1850.\nMany people think that climate change mainly means warmer temperatures. But temperature rise is only the beginning of the story. Because the Earth is a system where everything is connected, changes in one area can influence changes in all others.\nThe consequences of climate change include, among others, intense droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice, catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.\nClimate change can affect our health, ability to grow food, housing, safety and work. Some of us are already more vulnerable to climate impacts, such as people living in small island nations and other developing countries. Conditions like sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion have advanced to the point where entire communities have had to relocate, while protracted droughts are putting people at risk of famine. In the future, the number of people displaced by weather-related events is expected to rise.\nIn a series of UN reports, thousands of scientists and government reviewers agreed that limiting global temperature rise to no more than 1.5\u00b0C would help us avoid the worst climate impacts and maintain a liveable climate. Yet policies currently in place point to up to 2.8\u00b0C of warming by the end of the century.\nThe emissions that cause climate change come from every part of the world and affect everyone, but some countries produce much more than others. The six biggest emitters (China, the United States of America, India, the European Union, the Russian Federation, and Indonesia) together account for more than half of all global greenhouse gas emissions. By contrast, the 45 least developed countries contribute only 3 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.\nEveryone must take climate action, but people and countries creating more of the problem have a greater responsibility to act first.\nMany climate change solutions can deliver economic benefits while improving our lives and protecting the environment. We also have global frameworks and agreements to guide progress, such as the Sustainable Development Goals, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. Three broad categories of action are: cutting emissions, adapting to climate impacts and financing required adjustments.\nSwitching energy systems from fossil fuels to renewables like solar or wind will reduce the emissions driving climate change. But we have to act now. While a growing number of countries is committing to net zero emissions by 2050, emissions must be cut in half by 2030 to keep warming below 1.5\u00b0C. Achieving this means huge declines in the use of coal, oil and gas: production and consumption of all fossil fuels need to be cut by at least 30 per cent by 2030 in order to prevent catastrophic levels of climate change.\nAdapting to climate consequences protects people, homes, businesses, livelihoods, infrastructure and natural ecosystems. It covers current impacts and those likely in the future. Adaptation will be required everywhere but must be prioritized now for the most vulnerable people with the fewest resources to cope with climate hazards. The rate of return can be high. Early warning systems for disasters, for instance, save lives and property, and can deliver benefits up to 10 times the initial cost.\nClimate action requires significant financial investments by governments and businesses. But climate inaction is vastly more expensive. One critical step is for developed countries to support developing countries so they can adapt and move towards greener economies.\nTo get familiar with some of the more technical terms used in connection with climate change, consult the Climate Dictionary.\nClimate change is a hot topic \u2013 with myths and falsehoods circulating widely.

But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.\nBurning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun\u2019s heat and raising temperatures.\nThe main greenhouse gases that are causing climate change include carbon dioxide and methane. These come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example. Clearing land and cutting down forests can also release carbon dioxide. Agriculture, oil and gas operations are major sources of methane emissions. Energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main sectors causing greenhouse gases.\nClimate scientists have showed that humans are responsible for virtually all global heating over the last 200 years. Human activities like the ones mentioned above are causing greenhouse gases that are warming the world faster than at any time in at least the last two thousand years.\nThe average temperature of the Earth\u2019s surface is now about 1.42\u00b0C warmer than it was in the late 1800s-prior to the industrial revolution-and warmer than at any time in the last 100,000 years. The last decade (2015-2024) was the warmest on record, and each of the last four decades has been warmer than any previous decade since 1850.\nMany people think that climate change mainly means warmer temperatures. But temperature rise is only the beginning of the story. Because the Earth is a system where everything is connected, changes in one area can influence changes in all others.\nThe consequences of climate change include, among others, intense droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice, catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.\nClimate change can affect our health, ability to grow food, housing, safety and work. Some of us are already more vulnerable to climate impacts, such as people living in small island nations and other developing countries. Conditions like sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion have advanced to the point where entire communities have had to relocate, while protracted droughts are putting people at risk of famine. In the future, the number of people displaced by weather-related events is expected to rise.\nIn a series of UN reports, thousands of scientists and government reviewers agreed that limiting global temperature rise to no more than 1.5\u00b0C would help us avoid the worst climate impacts and maintain a liveable climate. Yet policies currently in place point to up to 2.8\u00b0C of warming by the end of the century.\nThe emissions that cause climate change come from every part of the world and affect everyone, but some countries produce much more than others. The six biggest emitters (China, the United States of America, India, the European Union, the Russian Federation, and Indonesia) together account for more than half of all global greenhouse gas emissions. By contrast, the 45 least developed countries contribute only 3 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.\nEveryone must take climate action, but people and countries creating more of the problem have a greater responsibility to act first.\nMany climate change solutions can deliver economic benefits while improving our lives and protecting the environment. We also have global frameworks and agreements to guide progress, such as the Sustainable Development Goals, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. Three broad categories of action are: cutting emissions, adapting to climate impacts and financing required adjustments.\nSwitching energy systems from fossil fuels to renewables like solar or wind will reduce the emissions driving climate change. But we have to act now. While a growing number of countries is committing to net zero emissions by 2050, emissions must be cut in half by 2030 to keep warming below 1.5\u00b0C. Achieving this means huge declines in the use of coal, oil and gas: production and consumption of all fossil fuels need to be cut by at least 30 per cent by 2030 in order to prevent catastrophic levels of climate change.\nAdapting to climate consequences protects people, homes, businesses, livelihoods, infrastructure and natural ecosystems. It covers current impacts and those likely in the future. Adaptation will be required everywhere but must be prioritized now for the most vulnerable people with the fewest resources to cope with climate hazards. The rate of return can be high. Early warning systems for disasters, for instance, save lives and property, and can deliver benefits up to 10 times the initial cost.\nClimate action requires significant financial investments by governments and businesses. But climate inaction is vastly more expensive. One critical step is for developed countries to support developing countries so they can adapt and move towards greener economies.\nTo get familiar with some of the more technical terms used in connection with climate change, consult the Climate Dictionary.\nClimate change is a hot topic \u2013 with myths and falsehoods circulating widely.
