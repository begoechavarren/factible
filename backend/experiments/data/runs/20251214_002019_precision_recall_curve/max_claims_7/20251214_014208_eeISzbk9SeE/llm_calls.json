Changes to Earth\u2019s climate driven by increased human emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases are already having widespread effects on the environment: glaciers and ice sheets are shrinking, river and lake ice is breaking up earlier, plant and animal geographic ranges are shifting, and plants and trees are blooming sooner.\nEffects that scientists had long predicted would result from global climate change are now occurring, such as sea ice loss, accelerated sea level rise, and longer, more intense heat waves.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nSome changes (such as droughts, wildfires, and extreme rainfall) are happening faster than scientists previously assessed. In fact, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) \u2014 the United Nations body established to assess the science related to climate change \u2014 modern humans have never before seen the observed changes in our global climate, and some of these changes are irreversible over the next hundreds to thousands of years.\nScientists have high confidence that global temperatures will continue to rise for many decades, mainly due to greenhouse gases produced by human activities.\nThe IPCC\u2019s Sixth Assessment report, published in 2021, found that human emissions of heat-trapping gases have already warmed the climate by nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius) since 1850-1900.1 The global average temperature is expected to reach or exceed 1.5 degrees C (about 3 degrees F) within the next few decades. These changes will affect all regions of Earth.\nThe severity of effects caused by climate change will depend on the path of future human activities. More greenhouse gas emissions will lead to more climate extremes and widespread damaging effects across our planet. However, those future effects depend on the total amount of carbon dioxide we emit. So, if we can reduce emissions, we may avoid some of the worst effects.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nHere are some of the expected effects of global climate change on the United States, according to the Third and Fourth National Climate Assessment Reports:\nGlobal sea level has risen about 8 inches (0.2 meters) since reliable record-keeping began in 1880. By 2100, scientists project that it will rise at least another foot (0.3 meters), but possibly as high as 6.6 feet (2 meters) in a high-emissions scenario. Sea level is rising because of added water from melting land ice and the expansion of seawater as it warms.

Image credit: Khagani Hasanov, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0\nScientists project that hurricane-associated storm intensity and rainfall rates will increase as the climate continues to warm. Image credit: NASA\nDroughts in the Southwest and heat waves (periods of abnormally hot weather lasting days to weeks) are projected to become more intense, and cold waves less intense and less frequent. Image credit: NOAA\nWarming temperatures have extended and intensified wildfire season in the West, where long-term drought in the region has heightened the risk of fires. Scientists estimate that human-caused climate change has already doubled the area of forest burned in recent decades. By around 2050, the amount of land consumed by wildfires in Western states is projected to further increase by two to six times. Even in traditionally rainy regions like the Southeast, wildfires are projected to increase by about 30%.\nClimate change is having an uneven effect on precipitation (rain and snow) in the United States, with some locations experiencing increased precipitation and flooding, while others suffer from drought. On average, more winter and spring precipitation is projected for the northern United States, and less for the Southwest, over this century. Image credit: Marvin Nauman/FEMA\nThe length of the frost-free season, and the corresponding growing season, has been increasing since the 1980s, with the largest increases occurring in the western United States. Across the United States, the growing season is projected to continue to lengthen, which will affect ecosystems and agriculture.\nSummer of 2023 was Earth's hottest summer on record, 0.41 degrees Fahrenheit (F) (0.23 degrees Celsius (C)) warmer than any other summer in NASA\u2019s record and 2.1 degrees F (1.2 C) warmer than the average summer between 1951 and 1980. Image credit: NASA\nSea ice cover in the Arctic Ocean is expected to continue decreasing, and the Arctic Ocean will very likely become essentially ice-free in late summer if current projections hold. This change is expected to occur before mid-century.\nClimate change is bringing different types of challenges to each region of the country. Some of the current and future impacts are summarized below. These findings are from the Third3 and Fourth4 National Climate Assessment Reports, released by the U.S. Global Change Research Program.\n1.

Changes to Earth\u2019s climate driven by increased human emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases are already having widespread effects on the environment: glaciers and ice sheets are shrinking, river and lake ice is breaking up earlier, plant and animal geographic ranges are shifting, and plants and trees are blooming sooner.\nEffects that scientists had long predicted would result from global climate change are now occurring, such as sea ice loss, accelerated sea level rise, and longer, more intense heat waves.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nSome changes (such as droughts, wildfires, and extreme rainfall) are happening faster than scientists previously assessed. In fact, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) \u2014 the United Nations body established to assess the science related to climate change \u2014 modern humans have never before seen the observed changes in our global climate, and some of these changes are irreversible over the next hundreds to thousands of years.\nScientists have high confidence that global temperatures will continue to rise for many decades, mainly due to greenhouse gases produced by human activities.\nThe IPCC\u2019s Sixth Assessment report, published in 2021, found that human emissions of heat-trapping gases have already warmed the climate by nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius) since 1850-1900.1 The global average temperature is expected to reach or exceed 1.5 degrees C (about 3 degrees F) within the next few decades. These changes will affect all regions of Earth.\nThe severity of effects caused by climate change will depend on the path of future human activities. More greenhouse gas emissions will lead to more climate extremes and widespread damaging effects across our planet. However, those future effects depend on the total amount of carbon dioxide we emit. So, if we can reduce emissions, we may avoid some of the worst effects.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nHere are some of the expected effects of global climate change on the United States, according to the Third and Fourth National Climate Assessment Reports:\nGlobal sea level has risen about 8 inches (0.2 meters) since reliable record-keeping began in 1880. By 2100, scientists project that it will rise at least another foot (0.3 meters), but possibly as high as 6.6 feet (2 meters) in a high-emissions scenario. Sea level is rising because of added water from melting land ice and the expansion of seawater as it warms.

Image credit: NASA\nDroughts in the Southwest and heat waves (periods of abnormally hot weather lasting days to weeks) are projected to become more intense, and cold waves less intense and less frequent. Image credit: NOAA\nWarming temperatures have extended and intensified wildfire season in the West, where long-term drought in the region has heightened the risk of fires. Scientists estimate that human-caused climate change has already doubled the area of forest burned in recent decades. By around 2050, the amount of land consumed by wildfires in Western states is projected to further increase by two to six times. Even in traditionally rainy regions like the Southeast, wildfires are projected to increase by about 30%.\nClimate change is having an uneven effect on precipitation (rain and snow) in the United States, with some locations experiencing increased precipitation and flooding, while others suffer from drought. On average, more winter and spring precipitation is projected for the northern United States, and less for the Southwest, over this century. Image credit: Marvin Nauman/FEMA\nThe length of the frost-free season, and the corresponding growing season, has been increasing since the 1980s, with the largest increases occurring in the western United States. Across the United States, the growing season is projected to continue to lengthen, which will affect ecosystems and agriculture.\nSummer of 2023 was Earth's hottest summer on record, 0.41 degrees Fahrenheit (F) (0.23 degrees Celsius (C)) warmer than any other summer in NASA\u2019s record and 2.1 degrees F (1.2 C) warmer than the average summer between 1951 and 1980. Image credit: NASA\nSea ice cover in the Arctic Ocean is expected to continue decreasing, and the Arctic Ocean will very likely become essentially ice-free in late summer if current projections hold. This change is expected to occur before mid-century.\nClimate change is bringing different types of challenges to each region of the country. Some of the current and future impacts are summarized below.

How do we know when we\u2019ve passed 1.5\u00b0C? And what happens if we do?\nThe Industrial Revolution transformed the textile industry in England. This engraving by Edward Goodall (1795-1870), originally titled \"Manchester, from Kersal Moor,\" after a painting of W. Wylde, shows numerous industrial chimneys in the town of Manchester, England, which earned the nickname \"Cottonopolis,\" following its transformation. Image in the public domain, from Wikimedia.\nWhen you read or hear climate numbers, they are often being compared to average. The September 2023 NOAA global surface temperatures, for instance, were 1.44 degrees Celsius above average. That average represents a defined period of time. In this case, September was 1.44\u00b0C warmer than the average September of the twentieth century.\nFor the 1.5\u00b0C climate threshold, the \u201caverage\u201d time range is defined as the \u201cpre-industrial period\u201d, or the period of time before the increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases due to human-emissions began to significantly influence global temperatures. Sounds a bit vague, right? What years make up this \u201cpre-industrial period?\u201d It depends.\nMost history books define the dates of the Industrial Revolution as between the mid-1700s and mid-1800s, but scientific definitions of pre-industrial typically cover some range of decades between 1850 and 1900. Why? Because that\u2019s the earliest time period with widespread, consistent surface temperature records. Different research groups use different parts of the broader time range. For NOAA data, we currently define pre-industrial as 1850-1900. (Footnote 1)\nWhile there can be differences in what counts as \u201cpre-industrial\u201d, it's important to remember that industrial versus pre-industrial is really about the human signature on our climate and how scientists can distinguish that from natural variability going back thousands of years. (Footnote 2)\nHow far the global temperature is above average depends on how you define average. For NOAA's global temperature dataset, \"pre-industrial\" is defined as the period from 1850-1900. For routine monthly reports, NOAA compares monthly temperatures to the 20th-century average. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from NCEI.\nAdding to the nuance, global surface temperature itself can potentially refer to different temperature variables measured in different ways. On land, thermometer-measured temperature variables can include readings at both at the literal ground surface and at two meters above. Over water, ships and buoys can measure the surface ocean temperature directly as well as the air temperature two meters above the water. From high above, satellites don\u2019t directly measure temperatures, but scientists derive land surface and atmospheric temperatures based on the amount of thermal and microwave energy satellites receive.\nSuffice to say, there are a lot of ways of measuring temperatures. And THEN there are different ways of combining those observations into a global dataset. (Despite these differences, all major temperature records show a similar long-term warming trend.) When NOAA releases the latest monthly climate statistics, it uses the NOAA Global Surface Temperature (NOAAGlobalTemp) dataset which blends in-ocean sea surface temperatures and 2-meter air temperatures.\nSo, when you come across stories about the 1.5\u00b0C threshold\u2014especially if you think you\u2019re seeing contradictory stories about whether we have or haven\u2019t reached 1.5\u00b0C\u2014 you should ask yourself three questions. 1) What is the dataset? 2) What is the \u201cpre-industrial\u201d time period? 3) What kind of temperature is being used? Those are the details you need to be able to put that story into context and compare it to other sources of information.\nLet\u2019s go back in time before large international climate conferences like COP28 existed. In the 1970s and 1980s, as climate science was evolving and our understanding of the impacts that human activities were having on greenhouse gas emissions, scientists were using different temperature thresholds to understand the potential impacts of these emissions (Nordhaus 1975). These thresholds usually ranged from 1-2\u00b0C.\nAs the international community has come together to address climate change, it became important to have an agreed upon temperature target as a catalyst for climate action When the first international climate treaty was negotiated in 1992, Parties agreed to stabilize \u201cgreenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.\u201d In 2010, the Cancun Agreement further recognized the need \u201cto hold the increase in global average temperature below 2\u00b0C above preindustrial levels\u201d.\nHowever, research continued to show that for some countries and vulnerable ecosystems, the risk of grave damage rapidly increases at less than 2\u00b0C of warming. So in 2015, nearly the entire world (195 nations) came together at the United Nations-held international climate meeting COP21 to sign the Paris Agreement. This landmark treaty explicitly states that the world\u2019s nations pledged to \u201chold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industr\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

As a result of this baseline increase in temperature, we are seeing extreme heat events, such as heatwaves and record-breaking high temperatures, become more frequent, long-lasting, and intense.\nWhilst a 1 \u00b0C background temperature increase may not seem significant, the resulting increase in the severity of extreme heat events is already evident in the observed record. This has widespread and significant impacts.\nExtreme heat events do occur within natural climate variation due to changes in global weather patterns. However, the increase in the frequency, duration, and intensity of these events over recent decades is clearly linked to the observed warming of the planet and can be attributed to human activity.\nGlobal circulation patterns, such as the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), are also being affected by the warming climate. These global circulation patterns affect weather patterns, which can lead to extreme heat events developing. We expect that as the planet continues to warm, these extreme heat events will continue to become more severe.\nThe overwhelming evidence that anthropogenic greenhouse gases are contributing to global warming, and the impacts being felt worldwide, led to the 2015 Paris Agreement. Nearly every nation signed this agreement, agreeing to address climate change and aiming to prevent global temperatures exceeding 2 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\nUK Observations\nEach year a report on the UK State of the Climate is published in order to highlight how the UK\u2019s weather and climate have changed compared to historical averages. The reports use scientific observations from the UK land weather station network and the HadUK-Grid dataset.\nThe top 10 warmest years for the UK since 1884 have occurred since 2002. In contrast, none of the coldest years have been recorded in this century.\nUK average temperatures have increased.\nIn early August 2020, at least twenty stations across southern England recorded maximum temperatures reaching 34 \u00b0C or more on six consecutive days. Five \u201ctropical nights\u201d were also recorded, when temperatures did not drop below 20 \u00b0C. The last time a similar event occurred was the summer of 1976, when at least twenty stations recorded 32 \u00b0C or more for six consecutive days.\nSince the start of this century, all but three years have recorded at least one tropical night. In contrast, only half the years between 1961-2000 recorded tropical nights.\nA special report on climate extremes in the UK found that we are experiencing higher maximum temperatures and longer warm spells in recent years. Warm spells have seen their average length more than double \u2013 increasing from 5.3 days in 1961-90 to over 13 days in the decade 2008-2017.\nSouth East England has seen some of the most significant changes, with warm spells increasing from around 6 days in length (during 1961-90) to over 18 days per year on average during 2008-2017.\nUK average maximum temperatures have increased and warm spells are longer.\nAll this evidence points to the UK\u2019s climate warming in recent decades, leading to warmer summers and milder winters on average. However, it is difficult to quantify if the UK is experiencing more heatwaves in recent years due to their sporadic nature.\nUK Projections\nIn the UK, climate predictions suggest that by the end of the 21st century all areas of the UK are projected to be warmer. Hotter and drier summers are likely to become more common. The latest set of UK climate projections (UKCP18) provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate could change over the 21st century.\nAs global temperatures rise, the number of days the UK observes 25 \u00b0C or more will increase. Data available here.\nUKCP18 showed that a summer as exceptionally warm as 2018 was very unlikely (less than 10% chance) in the recent past (1981-2000), but that warming so far had increased the chance to between 10-20%.\nBy mid-century, summers as warm as 2018 are expected to occur as often as not (about a 50% chance). By the end of the century the chance could increase to over 90% under a high greenhouse gas emission scenario.\nThe 2022 UK summer heatwave, marked a milestone in UK climate history, with 40\u00b0C being recorded for the first time in the UK and new national records set in Wales and Scotland and England.\nA study by the Met Office Hadley Centre suggests the current chance of seeing days reaching 40 \u00b0C or more is extremely low. However, by 2100 under a high emissions scenario the UK could see 40 \u00b0C days every 3-4 years.\nClimate change is increasing the chance of seeing 40 \u00b0C temperatures in the UK.\nGlobal Observations\nEach of the last four decades has been successively warmer than any decade preceding it since 1850. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) states, with high confidence, that global surface temperatures have increased faster since 1970 than any other 50-year period over at least the last 2000 years.\nThe AR6 report states that it is virtually certain (over 99% probability) that the frequency and intensity of hot extremes have increased on a global scale since 1950. It is also virtually certain that there have been increases in intensity and duration of heatwaves.\nUrban heat island effects have enhanced the impact of global warming in cities, particularly night-time extremes. It is extremely likely that human influence is the main contributor to these observed changes.\nOn a regional scale, Europe, North America, Asia and Australasia have very likely (over 90% probability) observed an increase in heat extremes and decrease in cold extremes. Europe, Asia and Australia have al\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This engraving by Edward Goodall (1795-1870), originally titled \"Manchester, from Kersal Moor,\" after a painting of W. Wylde, shows numerous industrial chimneys in the town of Manchester, England, which earned the nickname \"Cottonopolis,\" following its transformation. Image in the public domain, from Wikimedia.\nWhen you read or hear climate numbers, they are often being compared to average. The September 2023 NOAA global surface temperatures, for instance, were 1.44 degrees Celsius above average. That average represents a defined period of time. In this case, September was 1.44\u00b0C warmer than the average September of the twentieth century.\nFor the 1.5\u00b0C climate threshold, the \u201caverage\u201d time range is defined as the \u201cpre-industrial period\u201d, or the period of time before the increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases due to human-emissions began to significantly influence global temperatures. Sounds a bit vague, right? What years make up this \u201cpre-industrial period?\u201d It depends.\nMost history books define the dates of the Industrial Revolution as between the mid-1700s and mid-1800s, but scientific definitions of pre-industrial typically cover some range of decades between 1850 and 1900. Why? Because that\u2019s the earliest time period with widespread, consistent surface temperature records. Different research groups use different parts of the broader time range. For NOAA data, we currently define pre-industrial as 1850-1900. (Footnote 1)\nWhile there can be differences in what counts as \u201cpre-industrial\u201d, it's important to remember that industrial versus pre-industrial is really about the human signature on our climate and how scientists can distinguish that from natural variability going back thousands of years. (Footnote 2)\nHow far the global temperature is above average depends on how you define average. For NOAA's global temperature dataset, \"pre-industrial\" is defined as the period from 1850-1900. For routine monthly reports, NOAA compares monthly temperatures to the 20th-century average. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from NCEI.\nAdding to the nuance, global surface temperature itself can potentially refer to different temperature variables measured in different ways. On land, thermometer-measured temperature variables can include readings at both at the literal ground surface and at two meters above. Over water, ships and buoys can measure the surface ocean temperature directly as well as the air temperature two meters above the water. From high above, satellites don\u2019t directly measure temperatures, but scientists derive land surface and atmospheric temperatures based on the amount of thermal and microwave energy satellites receive.\nSuffice to say, there are a lot of ways of measuring temperatures. And THEN there are different ways of combining those observations into a global dataset. (Despite these differences, all major temperature records show a similar long-term warming trend.) When NOAA releases the latest monthly climate statistics, it uses the NOAA Global Surface Temperature (NOAAGlobalTemp) dataset which blends in-ocean sea surface temperatures and 2-meter air temperatures.\nSo, when you come across stories about the 1.5\u00b0C threshold\u2014especially if you think you\u2019re seeing contradictory stories about whether we have or haven\u2019t reached 1.5\u00b0C\u2014 you should ask yourself three questions. 1) What is the dataset? 2) What is the \u201cpre-industrial\u201d time period? 3) What kind of temperature is being used? Those are the details you need to be able to put that story into context and compare it to other sources of information.\nLet\u2019s go back in time before large international climate conferences like COP28 existed. In the 1970s and 1980s, as climate science was evolving and our understanding of the impacts that human activities were having on greenhouse gas emissions, scientists were using different temperature thresholds to understand the potential impacts of these emissions (Nordhaus 1975). These thresholds usually ranged from 1-2\u00b0C.\nAs the international community has come together to address climate change, it became important to have an agreed upon temperature target as a catalyst for climate action When the first international climate treaty was negotiated in 1992, Parties agreed to stabilize \u201cgreenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.\u201d In 2010, the Cancun Agreement further recognized the need \u201cto hold the increase in global average temperature below 2\u00b0C above preindustrial levels\u201d.\nHowever, research continued to show that for some countries and vulnerable ecosystems, the risk of grave damage rapidly increases at less than 2\u00b0C of warming. So in 2015, nearly the entire world (195 nations) came together at the United Nations-held international climate meeting COP21 to sign the Paris Agreement.

As a result of this baseline increase in temperature, we are seeing extreme heat events, such as heatwaves and record-breaking high temperatures, become more frequent, long-lasting, and intense.\nWhilst a 1 \u00b0C background temperature increase may not seem significant, the resulting increase in the severity of extreme heat events is already evident in the observed record. This has widespread and significant impacts.\nExtreme heat events do occur within natural climate variation due to changes in global weather patterns. However, the increase in the frequency, duration, and intensity of these events over recent decades is clearly linked to the observed warming of the planet and can be attributed to human activity.\nGlobal circulation patterns, such as the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), are also being affected by the warming climate. These global circulation patterns affect weather patterns, which can lead to extreme heat events developing. We expect that as the planet continues to warm, these extreme heat events will continue to become more severe.\nThe overwhelming evidence that anthropogenic greenhouse gases are contributing to global warming, and the impacts being felt worldwide, led to the 2015 Paris Agreement. Nearly every nation signed this agreement, agreeing to address climate change and aiming to prevent global temperatures exceeding 2 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\nUK Observations\nEach year a report on the UK State of the Climate is published in order to highlight how the UK\u2019s weather and climate have changed compared to historical averages. The reports use scientific observations from the UK land weather station network and the HadUK-Grid dataset.\nThe top 10 warmest years for the UK since 1884 have occurred since 2002. In contrast, none of the coldest years have been recorded in this century.\nUK average temperatures have increased.\nIn early August 2020, at least twenty stations across southern England recorded maximum temperatures reaching 34 \u00b0C or more on six consecutive days. Five \u201ctropical nights\u201d were also recorded, when temperatures did not drop below 20 \u00b0C. The last time a similar event occurred was the summer of 1976, when at least twenty stations recorded 32 \u00b0C or more for six consecutive days.\nSince the start of this century, all but three years have recorded at least one tropical night. In contrast, only half the years between 1961-2000 recorded tropical nights.\nA special report on climate extremes in the UK found that we are experiencing higher maximum temperatures and longer warm spells in recent years. Warm spells have seen their average length more than double \u2013 increasing from 5.3 days in 1961-90 to over 13 days in the decade 2008-2017.\nSouth East England has seen some of the most significant changes, with warm spells increasing from around 6 days in length (during 1961-90) to over 18 days per year on average during 2008-2017.\nUK average maximum temperatures have increased and warm spells are longer.\nAll this evidence points to the UK\u2019s climate warming in recent decades, leading to warmer summers and milder winters on average. However, it is difficult to quantify if the UK is experiencing more heatwaves in recent years due to their sporadic nature.\nUK Projections\nIn the UK, climate predictions suggest that by the end of the 21st century all areas of the UK are projected to be warmer. Hotter and drier summers are likely to become more common. The latest set of UK climate projections (UKCP18) provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate could change over the 21st century.\nAs global temperatures rise, the number of days the UK observes 25 \u00b0C or more will increase. Data available here.\nUKCP18 showed that a summer as exceptionally warm as 2018 was very unlikely (less than 10% chance) in the recent past (1981-2000), but that warming so far had increased the chance to between 10-20%.\nBy mid-century, summers as warm as 2018 are expected to occur as often as not (about a 50% chance). By the end of the century the chance could increase to over 90% under a high greenhouse gas emission scenario.\nThe 2022 UK summer heatwave, marked a milestone in UK climate history, with 40\u00b0C being recorded for the first time in the UK and new national records set in Wales and Scotland and England.\nA study by the Met Office Hadley Centre suggests the current chance of seeing days reaching 40 \u00b0C or more is extremely low. However, by 2100 under a high emissions scenario the UK could see 40 \u00b0C days every 3-4 years.\nClimate change is increasing the chance of seeing 40 \u00b0C temperatures in the UK.\nGlobal Observations\nEach of the last four decades has been successively warmer than any decade preceding it since 1850. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) states, with high confidence, that global surface temperatures have increased faster since 1970 than any other 50-year period over at least the last 2000 years.\nThe AR6 report states that it is virtually certain (over 99% probability) that the frequency and intensity of hot extremes have increased on a global scale since 1950. It is also virtually certain that there have been increases in intensity and duration of heatwaves.\nUrban heat island effects have enhanced the impact of global warming in cities, particularly night-time extremes. It is extremely likely that human influence is the main contributor to these observed changes.\nOn a regional scale, Europe, North America, Asia and Australasia have very likely (over 90% probability) observed an increase in heat extremes and decrease in cold extremes. Europe, Asia and Australia have al\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

These events affect ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nThe effects of human-caused global warming are happening now, are irreversible for people alive today, and will worsen as long as humans add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.\nGlobal climate change is not a future problem. Changes to Earth\u2019s climate driven by increased human emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases are already having widespread effects on the environment: glaciers and ice sheets are shrinking, river and lake ice is breaking up earlier, plant and animal geographic ranges are shifting, and plants and trees are blooming sooner.\nEffects that scientists had long predicted would result from global climate change are now occurring, such as sea ice loss, accelerated sea level rise, and longer, more intense heat waves.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nSome changes (such as droughts, wildfires, and extreme rainfall) are happening faster than scientists previously assessed. In fact, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) \u2014 the United Nations body established to assess the science related to climate change \u2014 modern humans have never before seen the observed changes in our global climate, and some of these changes are irreversible over the next hundreds to thousands of years.\nScientists have high confidence that global temperatures will continue to rise for many decades, mainly due to greenhouse gases produced by human activities.\nThe IPCC\u2019s Sixth Assessment report, published in 2021, found that human emissions of heat-trapping gases have already warmed the climate by nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius) since 1850-1900.1 The global average temperature is expected to reach or exceed 1.5 degrees C (about 3 degrees F) within the next few decades. These changes will affect all regions of Earth.\nThe severity of effects caused by climate change will depend on the path of future human activities. More greenhouse gas emissions will lead to more climate extremes and widespread damaging effects across our planet. However, those future effects depend on the total amount of carbon dioxide we emit. So, if we can reduce emissions, we may avoid some of the worst effects.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nHere are some of the expected effects of global climate change on the United States, according to the Third and Fourth National Climate Assessment Reports:\nGlobal sea level has risen about 8 inches (0.2 meters) since reliable record-keeping began in 1880. By 2100, scientists project that it will rise at least another foot (0.3 meters), but possibly as high as 6.6 feet (2 meters) in a high-emissions scenario. Sea level is rising because of added water from melting land ice and the expansion of seawater as it warms.

Image credit: Khagani Hasanov, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0\nScientists project that hurricane-associated storm intensity and rainfall rates will increase as the climate continues to warm. Image credit: NASA\nDroughts in the Southwest and heat waves (periods of abnormally hot weather lasting days to weeks) are projected to become more intense, and cold waves less intense and less frequent. Image credit: NOAA\nWarming temperatures have extended and intensified wildfire season in the West, where long-term drought in the region has heightened the risk of fires. Scientists estimate that human-caused climate change has already doubled the area of forest burned in recent decades. By around 2050, the amount of land consumed by wildfires in Western states is projected to further increase by two to six times. Even in traditionally rainy regions like the Southeast, wildfires are projected to increase by about 30%.\nClimate change is having an uneven effect on precipitation (rain and snow) in the United States, with some locations experiencing increased precipitation and flooding, while others suffer from drought. On average, more winter and spring precipitation is projected for the northern United States, and less for the Southwest, over this century. Image credit: Marvin Nauman/FEMA\nThe length of the frost-free season, and the corresponding growing season, has been increasing since the 1980s, with the largest increases occurring in the western United States. Across the United States, the growing season is projected to continue to lengthen, which will affect ecosystems and agriculture.\nSummer of 2023 was Earth's hottest summer on record, 0.41 degrees Fahrenheit (F) (0.23 degrees Celsius (C)) warmer than any other summer in NASA\u2019s record and 2.1 degrees F (1.2 C) warmer than the average summer between 1951 and 1980. Image credit: NASA\nSea ice cover in the Arctic Ocean is expected to continue decreasing, and the Arctic Ocean will very likely become essentially ice-free in late summer if current projections hold. This change is expected to occur before mid-century.\nClimate change is bringing different types of challenges to each region of the country. Some of the current and future impacts are summarized below.

Changes to Earth\u2019s climate driven by increased human emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases are already having widespread effects on the environment: glaciers and ice sheets are shrinking, river and lake ice is breaking up earlier, plant and animal geographic ranges are shifting, and plants and trees are blooming sooner.\nEffects that scientists had long predicted would result from global climate change are now occurring, such as sea ice loss, accelerated sea level rise, and longer, more intense heat waves.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nSome changes (such as droughts, wildfires, and extreme rainfall) are happening faster than scientists previously assessed. In fact, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) \u2014 the United Nations body established to assess the science related to climate change \u2014 modern humans have never before seen the observed changes in our global climate, and some of these changes are irreversible over the next hundreds to thousands of years.\nScientists have high confidence that global temperatures will continue to rise for many decades, mainly due to greenhouse gases produced by human activities.\nThe IPCC\u2019s Sixth Assessment report, published in 2021, found that human emissions of heat-trapping gases have already warmed the climate by nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius) since 1850-1900.1 The global average temperature is expected to reach or exceed 1.5 degrees C (about 3 degrees F) within the next few decades. These changes will affect all regions of Earth.\nThe severity of effects caused by climate change will depend on the path of future human activities. More greenhouse gas emissions will lead to more climate extremes and widespread damaging effects across our planet. However, those future effects depend on the total amount of carbon dioxide we emit. So, if we can reduce emissions, we may avoid some of the worst effects.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nHere are some of the expected effects of global climate change on the United States, according to the Third and Fourth National Climate Assessment Reports:\nGlobal sea level has risen about 8 inches (0.2 meters) since reliable record-keeping began in 1880. By 2100, scientists project that it will rise at least another foot (0.3 meters), but possibly as high as 6.6 feet (2 meters) in a high-emissions scenario. Sea level is rising because of added water from melting land ice and the expansion of seawater as it warms.

Image credit: Khagani Hasanov, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0\nScientists project that hurricane-associated storm intensity and rainfall rates will increase as the climate continues to warm. Image credit: NASA\nDroughts in the Southwest and heat waves (periods of abnormally hot weather lasting days to weeks) are projected to become more intense, and cold waves less intense and less frequent. Image credit: NOAA\nWarming temperatures have extended and intensified wildfire season in the West, where long-term drought in the region has heightened the risk of fires. Scientists estimate that human-caused climate change has already doubled the area of forest burned in recent decades. By around 2050, the amount of land consumed by wildfires in Western states is projected to further increase by two to six times. Even in traditionally rainy regions like the Southeast, wildfires are projected to increase by about 30%.\nClimate change is having an uneven effect on precipitation (rain and snow) in the United States, with some locations experiencing increased precipitation and flooding, while others suffer from drought. On average, more winter and spring precipitation is projected for the northern United States, and less for the Southwest, over this century. Image credit: Marvin Nauman/FEMA\nThe length of the frost-free season, and the corresponding growing season, has been increasing since the 1980s, with the largest increases occurring in the western United States. Across the United States, the growing season is projected to continue to lengthen, which will affect ecosystems and agriculture.\nSummer of 2023 was Earth's hottest summer on record, 0.41 degrees Fahrenheit (F) (0.23 degrees Celsius (C)) warmer than any other summer in NASA\u2019s record and 2.1 degrees F (1.2 C) warmer than the average summer between 1951 and 1980. Image credit: NASA\nSea ice cover in the Arctic Ocean is expected to continue decreasing, and the Arctic Ocean will very likely become essentially ice-free in late summer if current projections hold. This change is expected to occur before mid-century.\nClimate change is bringing different types of challenges to each region of the country. Some of the current and future impacts are summarized below.

Climate advocates had long hoped that it would be decades, if ever, before the 1.5\u00b0C threshold was breached. Keeping the global average temperature below that level is considered crucial for avoiding some of the worst effects of climate change.\n\u201cDespite all the warnings, the world has continued to emit greenhouse gasses at record levels, so this conclusion wasn\u2019t unexpected,\u201d said Martin Krause, Director of UNEP\u2019s Climate Change Division. \u201cBut it should be a wakeup call to everyone. Climate change is real, it\u2019s happening and unless we do something about it soon, the consequences will be severe.\u201d\nHow did the world get here and what does overshooting 1.5\u00b0C mean for humanity? Let\u2019s dive into the Emissions Gap Report to answer those and other questions.\nIt\u2019s been more than a decade since the Paris Agreement was signed. Why are we still facing a climate catastrophe?\nDespite the agreement, humanity continues to burn fossil fuels and pump out greenhouse gasses at a record rate. In 2024 these emissions \u2013 which act like a blanket, trapping heat near the Earth\u2019s surface \u2013 jumped over 2 per cent. That continues a steady increase dating back more than a century. There is now more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere than at any point in at least the last 2 million years.\nHow hot could the planet get?\nEven if countries live up to their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 and that\u2019s a big \u201cif\u201d \u2013 the world will warm by 2.3\u00b0C to 2.5\u00b0C by the end of the century, the Emissions Gap Report estimates. That\u2019s a slight improvement from last year\u2019s forecast. But it\u2019s still more than enough to destabilize delicate climate systems, leading to a surge in droughts, floods, superstorms and other extreme weather.\nWhen the Paris Agreement was adopted in 2015, experts calculated the world was on pace to warm by 3\u00b0C to 3.5\u00b0C based on countries\u2019 mitigation pledges \u2014 a potentially catastrophic path. Thanks to the commitments it inspired, that projection has fallen by about a full degree showing that global climate action can make a real difference.\nIn 2024, the Earth\u2019s average temperature was reportedly 1.5\u00b0C warmer than in pre-industrial times. So, what\u2019s new about the Emissions Gap Report\u2019s findings?\nIt\u2019s true that in 2024, the Earth did surpass 1.5\u00b0C of warming. But when researchers look at the global temperature, they try not to put too much stock into what happens in any single year. Instead, they look at the average temperature over decades, which smooths out random variations. This year\u2019s Emissions Gap Report finds this so-called \u201cmulti-decadal average\u201d will at least temporarily surpass 1.5\u00b0C in the next 10 years.\nIs there any chance of keeping warming below 1.5\u00b0C?\nTechnically, yes, but the odds of that happening are slim. The Emissions Gap Report found that greenhouse gas emissions would have to fall roughly by 55 per cent by 2035 to align with the 1.5\u00b0C pathway well above what countries have promised. A more achievable, though still difficult, goal is limiting warming to 2\u00b0C, which would require emissions to drop around 35 per cent by 2035. Current national commitments, if fully implemented, would cut emissions only 12 to 15 per cent by that date \u2014 leaving the world well off target.\nSo, what happens now that the world seems likely to overshoot the 1.5\u00b0C threshold?\nThe key is to keep this exceedance, as researchers call it, as minimal and as short-lived as possible. The report plotted a scenario where temperatures rise to about 1.8\u00b0C before falling back below 1.5\u00b0C before the end of the century. But even that will be challenging, it concedes. Still, the world can\u2019t stop trying, Krause said.\n\u201cEvery fraction of a degree of warming we avoid means climate change will be less severe.\n\u201cIf we buckle down, we can still potentially save lives, spare economies and prevent the world from reaching devastating climatic tipping points.\u201d\nSo, what needs to happen to get the world back on track?\nFirst and foremost, humanity needs to break its addiction to fossil fuels and ramp up the production of renewable energy. Doing that will require the leadership of the Group of 20 nations, which account for about three-quarters of greenhouse gas emissions and, collectively, are not on track to achieve their climate pledges. It also means more financial support for developing countries and an overhaul of the global financial architecture.\nIs there any good news on the climate front?\nYes. In the decade since the Paris Agreement was signed, we\u2019ve seen a surge in the use of renewable energy, buoyed in large part by plummeting costs. That has primed the world for a low-carbon future, marked by economic growth and energy security.\n\u201cWe have the technology and the know-how to end the climate crisis,\u201d says Krause. \u201cWhat we need now is the political will.\u201d\n\u00a9 2025 UNEP Terms of Use Privacy Report Project Concern Report Scam Contact Us\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

As a result of this baseline increase in temperature, we are seeing extreme heat events, such as heatwaves and record-breaking high temperatures, become more frequent, long-lasting, and intense.\nWhilst a 1 \u00b0C background temperature increase may not seem significant, the resulting increase in the severity of extreme heat events is already evident in the observed record. This has widespread and significant impacts.\nExtreme heat events do occur within natural climate variation due to changes in global weather patterns. However, the increase in the frequency, duration, and intensity of these events over recent decades is clearly linked to the observed warming of the planet and can be attributed to human activity.\nGlobal circulation patterns, such as the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), are also being affected by the warming climate. These global circulation patterns affect weather patterns, which can lead to extreme heat events developing. We expect that as the planet continues to warm, these extreme heat events will continue to become more severe.\nThe overwhelming evidence that anthropogenic greenhouse gases are contributing to global warming, and the impacts being felt worldwide, led to the 2015 Paris Agreement. Nearly every nation signed this agreement, agreeing to address climate change and aiming to prevent global temperatures exceeding 2 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\nUK Observations\nEach year a report on the UK State of the Climate is published in order to highlight how the UK\u2019s weather and climate have changed compared to historical averages. The reports use scientific observations from the UK land weather station network and the HadUK-Grid dataset.\nThe top 10 warmest years for the UK since 1884 have occurred since 2002. In contrast, none of the coldest years have been recorded in this century.\nUK average temperatures have increased.\nIn early August 2020, at least twenty stations across southern England recorded maximum temperatures reaching 34 \u00b0C or more on six consecutive days. Five \u201ctropical nights\u201d were also recorded, when temperatures did not drop below 20 \u00b0C. The last time a similar event occurred was the summer of 1976, when at least twenty stations recorded 32 \u00b0C or more for six consecutive days.\nSince the start of this century, all but three years have recorded at least one tropical night. In contrast, only half the years between 1961-2000 recorded tropical nights.\nA special report on climate extremes in the UK found that we are experiencing higher maximum temperatures and longer warm spells in recent years. Warm spells have seen their average length more than double \u2013 increasing from 5.3 days in 1961-90 to over 13 days in the decade 2008-2017.\nSouth East England has seen some of the most significant changes, with warm spells increasing from around 6 days in length (during 1961-90) to over 18 days per year on average during 2008-2017.\nUK average maximum temperatures have increased and warm spells are longer.\nAll this evidence points to the UK\u2019s climate warming in recent decades, leading to warmer summers and milder winters on average. However, it is difficult to quantify if the UK is experiencing more heatwaves in recent years due to their sporadic nature.\nUK Projections\nIn the UK, climate predictions suggest that by the end of the 21st century all areas of the UK are projected to be warmer. Hotter and drier summers are likely to become more common. The latest set of UK climate projections (UKCP18) provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate could change over the 21st century.\nAs global temperatures rise, the number of days the UK observes 25 \u00b0C or more will increase. Data available here.\nUKCP18 showed that a summer as exceptionally warm as 2018 was very unlikely (less than 10% chance) in the recent past (1981-2000), but that warming so far had increased the chance to between 10-20%.\nBy mid-century, summers as warm as 2018 are expected to occur as often as not (about a 50% chance). By the end of the century the chance could increase to over 90% under a high greenhouse gas emission scenario.\nThe 2022 UK summer heatwave, marked a milestone in UK climate history, with 40\u00b0C being recorded for the first time in the UK and new national records set in Wales and Scotland and England.\nA study by the Met Office Hadley Centre suggests the current chance of seeing days reaching 40 \u00b0C or more is extremely low. However, by 2100 under a high emissions scenario the UK could see 40 \u00b0C days every 3-4 years.\nClimate change is increasing the chance of seeing 40 \u00b0C temperatures in the UK.\nGlobal Observations\nEach of the last four decades has been successively warmer than any decade preceding it since 1850. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) states, with high confidence, that global surface temperatures have increased faster since 1970 than any other 50-year period over at least the last 2000 years.\nThe AR6 report states that it is virtually certain (over 99% probability) that the frequency and intensity of hot extremes have increased on a global scale since 1950. It is also virtually certain that there have been increases in intensity and duration of heatwaves.\nUrban heat island effects have enhanced the impact of global warming in cities, particularly night-time extremes. It is extremely likely that human influence is the main contributor to these observed changes.\nOn a regional scale, Europe, North America, Asia and Australasia have very likely (over 90% probability) observed an increase in heat extremes and decrease in cold extremes.

At 2 degrees Celsius of warming, 99% are lost.\n\nFull Page Content:\nExpected but sobering.\nThat is how experts are describing the findings of a new United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) report that says that global temperatures are on track to exceed the most ambitious end of the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement.\nModeling from UNEP\u2019s Emissions Gap Report 2025, released on Tuesday, found that within the next decade, global temperatures will likely exceed 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. Climate advocates had long hoped that it would be decades, if ever, before the 1.5\u00b0C threshold was breached. Keeping the global average temperature below that level is considered crucial for avoiding some of the worst effects of climate change.\n\u201cDespite all the warnings, the world has continued to emit greenhouse gasses at record levels, so this conclusion wasn\u2019t unexpected,\u201d said Martin Krause, Director of UNEP\u2019s Climate Change Division. \u201cBut it should be a wakeup call to everyone. Climate change is real, it\u2019s happening and unless we do something about it soon, the consequences will be severe.\u201d\nHow did the world get here and what does overshooting 1.5\u00b0C mean for humanity? Let\u2019s dive into the Emissions Gap Report to answer those and other questions.\nIt\u2019s been more than a decade since the Paris Agreement was signed. Why are we still facing a climate catastrophe?\nDespite the agreement, humanity continues to burn fossil fuels and pump out greenhouse gasses at a record rate. In 2024 these emissions \u2013 which act like a blanket, trapping heat near the Earth\u2019s surface \u2013 jumped over 2 per cent. That continues a steady increase dating back more than a century. There is now more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere than at any point in at least the last 2 million years.\nHow hot could the planet get?\nEven if countries live up to their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 and that\u2019s a big \u201cif\u201d \u2013 the world will warm by 2.3\u00b0C to 2.5\u00b0C by the end of the century, the Emissions Gap Report estimates. That\u2019s a slight improvement from last year\u2019s forecast. But it\u2019s still more than enough to destabilize delicate climate systems, leading to a surge in droughts, floods, superstorms and other extreme weather.\nWhen the Paris Agreement was adopted in 2015, experts calculated the world was on pace to warm by 3\u00b0C to 3.5\u00b0C based on countries\u2019 mitigation pledges \u2014 a potentially catastrophic path. Thanks to the commitments it inspired, that projection has fallen by about a full degree showing that global climate action can make a real difference.\nIn 2024, the Earth\u2019s average temperature was reportedly 1.5\u00b0C warmer than in pre-industrial times. So, what\u2019s new about the Emissions Gap Report\u2019s findings?\nIt\u2019s true that in 2024, the Earth did surpass 1.5\u00b0C of warming. But when researchers look at the global temperature, they try not to put too much stock into what happens in any single year. Instead, they look at the average temperature over decades, which smooths out random variations. This year\u2019s Emissions Gap Report finds this so-called \u201cmulti-decadal average\u201d will at least temporarily surpass 1.5\u00b0C in the next 10 years.\nIs there any chance of keeping warming below 1.5\u00b0C?\nTechnically, yes, but the odds of that happening are slim. The Emissions Gap Report found that greenhouse gas emissions would have to fall roughly by 55 per cent by 2035 to align with the 1.5\u00b0C pathway well above what countries have promised. A more achievable, though still difficult, goal is limiting warming to 2\u00b0C, which would require emissions to drop around 35 per cent by 2035. Current national commitments, if fully implemented, would cut emissions only 12 to 15 per cent by that date \u2014 leaving the world well off target.\nSo, what happens now that the world seems likely to overshoot the 1.5\u00b0C threshold?\nThe key is to keep this exceedance, as researchers call it, as minimal and as short-lived as possible. The report plotted a scenario where temperatures rise to about 1.8\u00b0C before falling back below 1.5\u00b0C before the end of the century. But even that will be challenging, it concedes. Still, the world can\u2019t stop trying, Krause said.\n\u201cEvery fraction of a degree of warming we avoid means climate change will be less severe.\n\u201cIf we buckle down, we can still potentially save lives, spare economies and prevent the world from reaching devastating climatic tipping points.\u201d\nSo, what needs to happen to get the world back on track?\nFirst and foremost, humanity needs to break its addiction to fossil fuels and ramp up the production of renewable energy. Doing that will require the leadership of the Group of 20 nations, which account for about three-quarters of greenhouse gas emissions and, collectively, are not on track to achieve their climate pledges. It also means more financial support for developing countries and an overhaul of the global financial architecture.\nIs there any good news on the climate front?\nYes. In the decade since the Paris Agreement was signed, we\u2019ve seen a surge in the use of renewable energy, buoyed in large part by plummeting costs. That has primed the world for a low-carbon future, marked by economic growth and energy security.\n\u201cWe have the technology and the know-how to end the climate crisis,\u201d says Krause. \u201cWhat we need now is the political will.\u201d\n\u00a9 2025 UNEP Terms of Use Privacy Report Project Concern Report Scam Contact Us\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Information.\nAccording to the annual report from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, 2024 was the warmest year since global records began in 1850. The global average surface temperature was 2.32 Fahrenheit (1.29 degrees Celsius) above the 20th-century average (57.0 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.9 degrees Celsius) and 2.63 degrees Fahrenheit (1.46 degrees Celsius) above the pre-industrial average (56.7 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.7 degrees Celsius), which NOAA defines as the period from 1850-1900.\nGlobal temperatures in 2024 were above the 1991-2020 average (red) across most of the planet. Yearly temperatures compared to the 20th-century average (bar chart) show that it has been 48 years since Earth had a cooler-than-average year. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe 2024 global temperature anomaly (anomaly means \u201cdifference from average\u201d) is 0.18 degrees F (0.10 degrees C) warmer than the previous record, set the year before, in 2023. The ten warmest years in the 175-year record have all occurred during the last decade (2015\u20132024). When the new century started in 2000, the first year to set a new high-temperature record was 2005. Now, 2005 is just the 13th-warmest year on record.\nOther 2024 rankings included...\nFor more regional details and 2024 climate statistics, see the 2024 Global Climate Report from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe global average surface temperature is an indicator of the state of Earth\u2019s energy balance: how much sunlight it absorbs minus how much heat it radiates back to space. When these amounts are the same, Earth\u2019s average surface temperature remains steady. When they are out of balance, Earth cools or warms. Earth\u2019s average surface temperature has been rising because human-produced greenhouse gases are causing Earth to absorb more energy than it radiates back to space.\nGiven the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of added heat energy to raise Earth\u2019s average surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree-Fahrenheit (1-degree-Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1850-1900 in NOAA's record) might seem small, but it represents a significant increase in heat energy circulating through all parts of the Earth system, including the oceans, frozen landscapes, and the atmosphere.\nBeyond being an indicator of changes in Earth\u2019s energy balance, surface temperature matters because it controls many environmental and ecological processes that are important to humans and other life, including the water cycle (evaporation, clouds, surface water supplies, and precipitation), the carbon cycle, and the kinds of plants, animals, and other living things that can survive in different places on Earth.\nThe concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (55 degrees Celsius) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the \"average\" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget, which can only be directly measured from space.\nTo calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute temperature readings to temperature anomalies\u2014the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend.\nAcross inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and known physical relationships\u2014such as the way temperature decreases with altitude\u2014to estimate the missing values. Each value is then used to calculate a global-scale temperature anomaly. This process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in Earth's surface temperature over time. Read more about how the global surface temperature record is built in our Climate Data Primer.\nTemperature change has not been uniform across the planet, but more areas are warming than cooling. And the rate of warming has accelerated in recent decades. According to NOAA's 2024 Annual Climate Report the combined land and ocean temperature has warmed at an average rate of 0.11 degrees Fahrenheit (0.06 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1850 and more than three times that rate (0.36 degrees Fahrenheit, or 0.20 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1975.\nRecent rates of global warming (1994-2024, bottom) are larger than the longer-term average rates (1901-2024, top). Places that have cooled are colored blue; places that have warmed are colored yellow, orange, or red. In the past three decades, many places in the Northern Hemisphere have warmed by 1 degree Fahrenheit or more per decade. Differences are most dramatic in the Arctic. With the decline of ice and snow, the Arctic reflects less incoming sunlight, which amplifies the rate of greenhouse-gas-driven warming. NOAA Climate.gov, based o\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The meaning of the 1.5-C climate threshold\n\nGoogle Search Snippet:\nGlobal average temperature was more than 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than the pre-industrial average for several months in late 2023.\n\nFull Page Content:\nThis website is an ARCHIVED version of NOAA Climate.gov as of June 25, 2025. Content is not being updated or maintained, and some links may no longer work.\nNumbers and the meanings we attach to them can be weird. A number can mean a lot or very little depending on how it is being used, and who is using it. To a Taylor Swift fan, 13 is a lucky number. To many in Western cultures, it is a day of bad luck when falling on a Friday. To others, 13 is just the number that comes after 12. When it comes to climate science and policy, one of our \u201c13s\u201d is the 1.5\u00b0C climate threshold, shorthand for global average surface warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures. That\u2019s the level of warming that the countries who signed the Paris Agreement have agreed to try to stay below. But what does pre-industrial mean? How do we know when we\u2019ve passed 1.5\u00b0C? And what happens if we do?\nThe Industrial Revolution transformed the textile industry in England. This engraving by Edward Goodall (1795-1870), originally titled \"Manchester, from Kersal Moor,\" after a painting of W. Wylde, shows numerous industrial chimneys in the town of Manchester, England, which earned the nickname \"Cottonopolis,\" following its transformation. Image in the public domain, from Wikimedia.\nWhen you read or hear climate numbers, they are often being compared to average. The September 2023 NOAA global surface temperatures, for instance, were 1.44 degrees Celsius above average. That average represents a defined period of time. In this case, September was 1.44\u00b0C warmer than the average September of the twentieth century.\nFor the 1.5\u00b0C climate threshold, the \u201caverage\u201d time range is defined as the \u201cpre-industrial period\u201d, or the period of time before the increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases due to human-emissions began to significantly influence global temperatures. Sounds a bit vague, right? What years make up this \u201cpre-industrial period?\u201d It depends.\nMost history books define the dates of the Industrial Revolution as between the mid-1700s and mid-1800s, but scientific definitions of pre-industrial typically cover some range of decades between 1850 and 1900. Why? Because that\u2019s the earliest time period with widespread, consistent surface temperature records. Different research groups use different parts of the broader time range. For NOAA data, we currently define pre-industrial as 1850-1900. (Footnote 1)\nWhile there can be differences in what counts as \u201cpre-industrial\u201d, it's important to remember that industrial versus pre-industrial is really about the human signature on our climate and how scientists can distinguish that from natural variability going back thousands of years. (Footnote 2)\nHow far the global temperature is above average depends on how you define average. For NOAA's global temperature dataset, \"pre-industrial\" is defined as the period from 1850-1900. For routine monthly reports, NOAA compares monthly temperatures to the 20th-century average. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from NCEI.\nAdding to the nuance, global surface temperature itself can potentially refer to different temperature variables measured in different ways. On land, thermometer-measured temperature variables can include readings at both at the literal ground surface and at two meters above. Over water, ships and buoys can measure the surface ocean temperature directly as well as the air temperature two meters above the water. From high above, satellites don\u2019t directly measure temperatures, but scientists derive land surface and atmospheric temperatures based on the amount of thermal and microwave energy satellites receive.\nSuffice to say, there are a lot of ways of measuring temperatures. And THEN there are different ways of combining those observations into a global dataset. (Despite these differences, all major temperature records show a similar long-term warming trend.) When NOAA releases the latest monthly climate statistics, it uses the NOAA Global Surface Temperature (NOAAGlobalTemp) dataset which blends in-ocean sea surface temperatures and 2-meter air temperatures.\nSo, when you come across stories about the 1.5\u00b0C threshold\u2014especially if you think you\u2019re seeing contradictory stories about whether we have or haven\u2019t reached 1.5\u00b0C\u2014 you should ask yourself three questions. 1) What is the dataset? 2) What is the \u201cpre-industrial\u201d time period? 3) What kind of temperature is being used? Those are the details you need to be able to put that story into context and compare it to other sources of information.\nLet\u2019s go back in time before large international climate conferences like COP28 existed. In the 1970s and 1980s, as climate science was evolving and our understanding of the impacts that human activities were having on greenhouse gas emissions, scientists were using different temperature thresholds to understand the potential impacts of these emissions (Nordhaus 1975). These thresholds usually ranged from 1-2\u00b0C.\nAs the international community has come together to address climate change, it became important to have an agreed upon temperature target as a catalyst for climate action When the first international climate treaty was negotiated in 1992, Parties agreed to stabilize \u201cgreenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.\u201d In 2010, the Cancun Agreement further recognized the need \u201cto hold the increase in global average temperature below 2\u00b0C above preindustrial levels\u201d.\nHowever, research continued to show that for some countries and vulnerable ecosystems, the risk of grave damage rapidly increases at less than 2\u00b0C of warming. So in 2015, nearly the entire world (195 nations) came together at the United Nations-held international climate meeting COP21 to sign the Paris Agreement. This landmark treaty explicitly states that the world\u2019s nations pledged to \u201chold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industr\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

These changes will affect all regions of Earth.\nThe severity of effects caused by climate change will depend on the path of future human activities. More greenhouse gas emissions will lead to more climate extremes and widespread damaging effects across our planet. However, those future effects depend on the total amount of carbon dioxide we emit. So, if we can reduce emissions, we may avoid some of the worst effects.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nHere are some of the expected effects of global climate change on the United States, according to the Third and Fourth National Climate Assessment Reports:\nGlobal sea level has risen about 8 inches (0.2 meters) since reliable record-keeping began in 1880. By 2100, scientists project that it will rise at least another foot (0.3 meters), but possibly as high as 6.6 feet (2 meters) in a high-emissions scenario. Sea level is rising because of added water from melting land ice and the expansion of seawater as it warms.

Image credit: NASA\nDroughts in the Southwest and heat waves (periods of abnormally hot weather lasting days to weeks) are projected to become more intense, and cold waves less intense and less frequent. Image credit: NOAA\nWarming temperatures have extended and intensified wildfire season in the West, where long-term drought in the region has heightened the risk of fires. Scientists estimate that human-caused climate change has already doubled the area of forest burned in recent decades. By around 2050, the amount of land consumed by wildfires in Western states is projected to further increase by two to six times. Even in traditionally rainy regions like the Southeast, wildfires are projected to increase by about 30%.\nClimate change is having an uneven effect on precipitation (rain and snow) in the United States, with some locations experiencing increased precipitation and flooding, while others suffer from drought. On average, more winter and spring precipitation is projected for the northern United States, and less for the Southwest, over this century. Image credit: Marvin Nauman/FEMA\nThe length of the frost-free season, and the corresponding growing season, has been increasing since the 1980s, with the largest increases occurring in the western United States. Across the United States, the growing season is projected to continue to lengthen, which will affect ecosystems and agriculture.\nSummer of 2023 was Earth's hottest summer on record, 0.41 degrees Fahrenheit (F) (0.23 degrees Celsius (C)) warmer than any other summer in NASA\u2019s record and 2.1 degrees F (1.2 C) warmer than the average summer between 1951 and 1980.

Blue bars indicate cooler-than-average years; red bars show warmer-than-average years. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Information.\nAccording to the annual report from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, 2024 was the warmest year since global records began in 1850. The global average surface temperature was 2.32 Fahrenheit (1.29 degrees Celsius) above the 20th-century average (57.0 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.9 degrees Celsius) and 2.63 degrees Fahrenheit (1.46 degrees Celsius) above the pre-industrial average (56.7 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.7 degrees Celsius), which NOAA defines as the period from 1850-1900.\nGlobal temperatures in 2024 were above the 1991-2020 average (red) across most of the planet. Yearly temperatures compared to the 20th-century average (bar chart) show that it has been 48 years since Earth had a cooler-than-average year. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe 2024 global temperature anomaly (anomaly means \u201cdifference from average\u201d) is 0.18 degrees F (0.10 degrees C) warmer than the previous record, set the year before, in 2023. The ten warmest years in the 175-year record have all occurred during the last decade (2015\u20132024). When the new century started in 2000, the first year to set a new high-temperature record was 2005. Now, 2005 is just the 13th-warmest year on record.\nOther 2024 rankings included...\nFor more regional details and 2024 climate statistics, see the 2024 Global Climate Report from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe global average surface temperature is an indicator of the state of Earth\u2019s energy balance: how much sunlight it absorbs minus how much heat it radiates back to space. When these amounts are the same, Earth\u2019s average surface temperature remains steady. When they are out of balance, Earth cools or warms. Earth\u2019s average surface temperature has been rising because human-produced greenhouse gases are causing Earth to absorb more energy than it radiates back to space.\nGiven the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of added heat energy to raise Earth\u2019s average surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree-Fahrenheit (1-degree-Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1850-1900 in NOAA's record) might seem small, but it represents a significant increase in heat energy circulating through all parts of the Earth system, including the oceans, frozen landscapes, and the atmosphere.\nBeyond being an indicator of changes in Earth\u2019s energy balance, surface temperature matters because it controls many environmental and ecological processes that are important to humans and other life, including the water cycle (evaporation, clouds, surface water supplies, and precipitation), the carbon cycle, and the kinds of plants, animals, and other living things that can survive in different places on Earth.\nThe concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (55 degrees Celsius) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the \"average\" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget, which can only be directly measured from space.\nTo calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute temperature readings to temperature anomalies\u2014the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend.\nAcross inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and known physical relationships\u2014such as the way temperature decreases with altitude\u2014to estimate the missing values. Each value is then used to calculate a global-scale temperature anomaly. This process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in Earth's surface temperature over time. Read more about how the global surface temperature record is built in our Climate Data Primer.\nTemperature change has not been uniform across the planet, but more areas are warming than cooling. And the rate of warming has accelerated in recent decades. According to NOAA's 2024 Annual Climate Report the combined land and ocean temperature has warmed at an average rate of 0.11 degrees Fahrenheit (0.06 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1850 and more than three times that rate (0.36 degrees Fahrenheit, or 0.20 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1975.\nRecent rates of global warming (1994-2024, bottom) are larger than the longer-term average rates (1901-2024, top). Places that have cooled are colored blue; places that have warmed are colored yellow, orange, or red. In the past three decades, many places in the Northern Hemisphere have warmed by 1 degree Fahrenheit or more per decade. Differences are most dramatic in the Arctic. With the decline of ice and snow, the Arctic reflects less incoming sunlight, which amplifies the rate of greenhouse-gas-driven warming. NOAA Climate.gov, based o\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Yearly temperatures compared to the 20th-century average (bar chart) show that it has been 48 years since Earth had a cooler-than-average year. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe 2024 global temperature anomaly (anomaly means \u201cdifference from average\u201d) is 0.18 degrees F (0.10 degrees C) warmer than the previous record, set the year before, in 2023. The ten warmest years in the 175-year record have all occurred during the last decade (2015\u20132024). When the new century started in 2000, the first year to set a new high-temperature record was 2005. Now, 2005 is just the 13th-warmest year on record.\nOther 2024 rankings included...\nFor more regional details and 2024 climate statistics, see the 2024 Global Climate Report from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe global average surface temperature is an indicator of the state of Earth\u2019s energy balance: how much sunlight it absorbs minus how much heat it radiates back to space. When these amounts are the same, Earth\u2019s average surface temperature remains steady. When they are out of balance, Earth cools or warms. Earth\u2019s average surface temperature has been rising because human-produced greenhouse gases are causing Earth to absorb more energy than it radiates back to space.\nGiven the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of added heat energy to raise Earth\u2019s average surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree-Fahrenheit (1-degree-Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1850-1900 in NOAA's record) might seem small, but it represents a significant increase in heat energy circulating through all parts of the Earth system, including the oceans, frozen landscapes, and the atmosphere.\nBeyond being an indicator of changes in Earth\u2019s energy balance, surface temperature matters because it controls many environmental and ecological processes that are important to humans and other life, including the water cycle (evaporation, clouds, surface water supplies, and precipitation), the carbon cycle, and the kinds of plants, animals, and other living things that can survive in different places on Earth.\nThe concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (55 degrees Celsius) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the \"average\" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget, which can only be directly measured from space.\nTo calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute temperature readings to temperature anomalies\u2014the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend.\nAcross inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and known physical relationships\u2014such as the way temperature decreases with altitude\u2014to estimate the missing values. Each value is then used to calculate a global-scale temperature anomaly. This process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in Earth's surface temperature over time. Read more about how the global surface temperature record is built in our Climate Data Primer.\nTemperature change has not been uniform across the planet, but more areas are warming than cooling. And the rate of warming has accelerated in recent decades. According to NOAA's 2024 Annual Climate Report the combined land and ocean temperature has warmed at an average rate of 0.11 degrees Fahrenheit (0.06 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1850 and more than three times that rate (0.36 degrees Fahrenheit, or 0.20 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1975.\nRecent rates of global warming (1994-2024, bottom) are larger than the longer-term average rates (1901-2024, top). Places that have cooled are colored blue; places that have warmed are colored yellow, orange, or red. In the past three decades, many places in the Northern Hemisphere have warmed by 1 degree Fahrenheit or more per decade. Differences are most dramatic in the Arctic. With the decline of ice and snow, the Arctic reflects less incoming sunlight, which amplifies the rate of greenhouse-gas-driven warming. NOAA Climate.gov, based o\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Changes to Earth\u2019s climate driven by increased human emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases are already having widespread effects on the environment: glaciers and ice sheets are shrinking, river and lake ice is breaking up earlier, plant and animal geographic ranges are shifting, and plants and trees are blooming sooner.\nEffects that scientists had long predicted would result from global climate change are now occurring, such as sea ice loss, accelerated sea level rise, and longer, more intense heat waves.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nSome changes (such as droughts, wildfires, and extreme rainfall) are happening faster than scientists previously assessed. In fact, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) \u2014 the United Nations body established to assess the science related to climate change \u2014 modern humans have never before seen the observed changes in our global climate, and some of these changes are irreversible over the next hundreds to thousands of years.\nScientists have high confidence that global temperatures will continue to rise for many decades, mainly due to greenhouse gases produced by human activities.\nThe IPCC\u2019s Sixth Assessment report, published in 2021, found that human emissions of heat-trapping gases have already warmed the climate by nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius) since 1850-1900.1 The global average temperature is expected to reach or exceed 1.5 degrees C (about 3 degrees F) within the next few decades. These changes will affect all regions of Earth.\nThe severity of effects caused by climate change will depend on the path of future human activities. More greenhouse gas emissions will lead to more climate extremes and widespread damaging effects across our planet. However, those future effects depend on the total amount of carbon dioxide we emit. So, if we can reduce emissions, we may avoid some of the worst effects.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nHere are some of the expected effects of global climate change on the United States, according to the Third and Fourth National Climate Assessment Reports:\nGlobal sea level has risen about 8 inches (0.2 meters) since reliable record-keeping began in 1880. By 2100, scientists project that it will rise at least another foot (0.3 meters), but possibly as high as 6.6 feet (2 meters) in a high-emissions scenario. Sea level is rising because of added water from melting land ice and the expansion of seawater as it warms.

Image credit: Khagani Hasanov, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0\nScientists project that hurricane-associated storm intensity and rainfall rates will increase as the climate continues to warm. Image credit: NASA\nDroughts in the Southwest and heat waves (periods of abnormally hot weather lasting days to weeks) are projected to become more intense, and cold waves less intense and less frequent. Image credit: NOAA\nWarming temperatures have extended and intensified wildfire season in the West, where long-term drought in the region has heightened the risk of fires. Scientists estimate that human-caused climate change has already doubled the area of forest burned in recent decades. By around 2050, the amount of land consumed by wildfires in Western states is projected to further increase by two to six times. Even in traditionally rainy regions like the Southeast, wildfires are projected to increase by about 30%.\nClimate change is having an uneven effect on precipitation (rain and snow) in the United States, with some locations experiencing increased precipitation and flooding, while others suffer from drought. On average, more winter and spring precipitation is projected for the northern United States, and less for the Southwest, over this century. Image credit: Marvin Nauman/FEMA\nThe length of the frost-free season, and the corresponding growing season, has been increasing since the 1980s, with the largest increases occurring in the western United States. Across the United States, the growing season is projected to continue to lengthen, which will affect ecosystems and agriculture.\nSummer of 2023 was Earth's hottest summer on record, 0.41 degrees Fahrenheit (F) (0.23 degrees Celsius (C)) warmer than any other summer in NASA\u2019s record and 2.1 degrees F (1.2 C) warmer than the average summer between 1951 and 1980. Image credit: NASA\nSea ice cover in the Arctic Ocean is expected to continue decreasing, and the Arctic Ocean will very likely become essentially ice-free in late summer if current projections hold. This change is expected to occur before mid-century.\nClimate change is bringing different types of challenges to each region of the country. Some of the current and future impacts are summarized below.

    "input_prompt": "Claim:\nHeat waves have more than doubled in duration in the past 50 years.\n\nArticle Title:\nWorld of Change: Global Temperatures - NASA Science\n\nGoogle Search Snippet:\nThe average global temperature has increased by a little more than 1 degree Celsius since 1880. Two-thirds of the warming has occurred since 1975.\n\nFull Page Content:\nAir temperatures on Earth have been rising since the Industrial Revolution. While natural variability plays some part, the preponderance of evidence indicates that human activities\u2014particularly emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases\u2014are mostly responsible for making our planet warmer.\nAccording to an ongoing temperature analysis led by scientists at NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), the average global temperature on Earth has increased by at least 1.1\u00b0 Celsius (1.9\u00b0 Fahrenheit) since 1880. The majority of the warming has occurred since 1975, at a rate of roughly 0.15 to 0.20\u00b0C per decade.\nThe maps above show temperature anomalies in five-year increments since 1880. (Click on the arrow to run the animation.) These are not absolute temperatures, but changes from the norm for each area. The data reflect how much warmer or cooler each region was compared to a base period of 1951-1980. (The global mean surface air temperature for that period was 14\u00b0C (57\u00b0F), with an uncertainty of several tenths of a degree.)\nThe image below shows global temperature anomalies in 2022, which tied for the fifth warmest year on record. The past nine years have been the warmest years since modern recordkeeping began in 1880.\nAs the maps show, global warming does not mean temperatures rise everywhere at every time by same rate. Temperatures might rise 5 degrees in one region and drop 2 degrees in another. For instance, exceptionally cold winters in one place might be balanced by extremely warm winters in another part of the world. Generally, warming is greater over land than over the oceans because water is slower to absorb and release heat (thermal inertia). Warming may also differ substantially within specific land masses and ocean basins.\nIn the animation at the top of the page and in the bar chart below, the years from 1880 to 1939 tend to be cooler, then level off by the 1950s. Decades within the base period (1951-1980) do not appear particularly warm or cold because they are the standard against which other years are measured.\nThe leveling off of temperatures in the middle of the 20th century can be explained by natural variability and by the cooling effects of aerosols generated by factories, power plants, and motor vehicles in the years of rapid economic growth after World War II. Fossil fuel use also increased after the war (5 percent per year), boosting greenhouse gases. Cooling from aerosol pollution happened rapidly. In contrast, greenhouse gases accumulated slowly, but they remain in the atmosphere for a much longer time. According to former GISS director James Hansen, the strong warming trend of the past four decades likely reflects a shift from balanced aerosol and greenhouse gas effects on the atmosphere to a predominance of greenhouse gas effects after aerosols were curbed by pollution controls.\nWhy should we care about one or two degrees of global warming? After all, temperatures fluctuate by many degrees every day where we live.\nThe temperatures we experience locally and in short periods can fluctuate significantly due to predictable, cyclical events (night and day, summer and winter) and hard-to-predict wind and precipitation patterns. But the global temperature mainly depends on how much energy the planet receives from the Sun and how much it radiates back into space. The energy coming from the Sun fluctuates very little by year, while the amount of energy radiated by Earth is closely tied to the chemical composition of the atmosphere\u2014particularly the amount of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.\nA one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all of the oceans, the atmosphere, and the land masses by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age. A five-degree drop was enough to bury a large part of North America under a towering mass of ice 20,000 years ago.\nGlobal temperature records start around 1880 because observations did not sufficiently cover enough of the planet prior to that time. The line plot above shows yearly temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2020 as recorded by NASA, NOAA, the Berkeley Earth research group, the Met Office Hadley Centre (United Kingdom), and the Cowtan and Way analysis. Though there are minor variations from year to year, all five records show peaks and valleys in sync with each other. All show rapid warming in the past few decades, and all show the last decade as the warmest.\nThe NASA GISS team chose the period of 1951-1980 as its baseline largely because the U.S. National Weather Service uses a three-decade period to define \u201cnormal\u201d or average temperature. The GISS temperature analysis effort also began around 1980, so the most recent 30 years was 1951-1980. Their objective is to provide an estimate of temperature change that could be compared with predictions of global climate change in response to atmospheric carbon dioxide, aerosols, and changes in solar activity.\nNASA\u2019s temperature analyses incorporate surface temperature measurements from more than 20,000 weather stations, ship- and buoy-based observations of sea surface temperatures, and temperature measurements from Antarctic research stations. These in situ measurements are analyzed using an algorithm that considers the varied spacing of temperature stations around the globe and urban heat island effects.\nSubscribe to the Earth Observatory and get the Earth in your inbox.\nNASA's Earth Observatory brings you the Earth, every day, with in-depth stories and stunning imagery.\nExplore Earth Science\nEarth Science Data\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Human activity is the principal cause.\nEarth's climate has changed throughout history. Just in the last 800,000 years, there have been eight cycles of ice ages and warmer periods, with the end of the last ice age about 11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era \u2014 and of human civilization. Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth\u2019s orbit that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives.\nThe current warming trend is different because it is clearly the result of human activities since the mid-1800s, and is proceeding at a rate not seen over many recent millennia.1 It is undeniable that human activities have produced the atmospheric gases that have trapped more of the Sun\u2019s energy in the Earth system. This extra energy has warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land, and widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred.\nEarth-orbiting satellites and new technologies have helped scientists see the big picture, collecting many different types of information about our planet and its climate all over the world. These data, collected over many years, reveal the signs and patterns of a changing climate.\nScientists demonstrated the heat-trapping nature of carbon dioxide and other gases in the mid-19th century.2 Many of the science instruments NASA uses to study our climate focus on how these gases affect the movement of infrared radiation through the atmosphere. From the measured impacts of increases in these gases, there is no question that increased greenhouse gas levels warm Earth in response.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nIce cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that Earth\u2019s climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly 10 times faster than the average rate of warming after an ice age. Carbon dioxide from human activities is increasing about 250 times faster than it did from natural sources after the last Ice Age.3\nThe planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and other human activities.4 Most of the warming occurred in the past 40 years, with the seven most recent years being the warmest. The years 2016 and 2020 are tied for the warmest year on record.5 Image credit: Ashwin Kumar, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic.\nThe ocean has absorbed much of this increased heat, with the top 100 meters (about 328 feet) of ocean showing warming of 0.67 degrees Fahrenheit (0.33 degrees Celsius) since 1969.6 Earth stores 90% of the extra energy in the ocean.

Changes in Naturally Occurring Carbon Dioxide ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nSince the industrial revolution in the mid-1800s, human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and the clearing of land for agriculture, have increased the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2.12\u00b0 Fahrenheit (1.18\u00b0 Celsius) since the late 19th century, and 10 of the warmest years on record(link is external) have been observed since 2014.\nIn its Sixth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that it is unequivocal that the increase of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) in the atmosphere over the industrial era is the result of human activities and that human influence is the principal driver of many changes observed across the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere.\nLife on Earth depends on energy from the Sun. About half the light energy reaching Earth's atmosphere passes through the air and clouds to the surface, where it is absorbed and radiated in the form of infrared heat. Nearly 90% of this heat is then absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-radiated, slowing heat loss to space. GHGs include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), ozone (O3), and water vapor (H2O).\nRemotely sensed greenhouse gas data, such as the data collected by NASA\u2019s Earth-observing satellites, are used in atmospheric models to estimate the sources and sinks of these gases. These data allow researchers to pinpoint sources and hotspots of greenhouse gases across the globe. NASA also curates socioeconomic data to shed light on the health impacts of greenhouse gas emissions on people and communities. The U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center(link is external) is a joint effort between NASA and other U.S. government agencies to open up access to trusted data on greenhouse gases.\nAccess a range of datasets and data tools to further your research in industrial emissions and greenhouse gases.\nWhile NASA data are openly available without restriction, an Earthdata Login is required to download data and to use some tools with full functionality.\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\nOur online forum provides a space for users to browse thousands of FAQs about research needs, data, and data applications.

As global temperatures continue to rise due to climate change, heat wave frequency and severity are expected to continue to increase.5 Areas already impacted by heat islands will likely bear the brunt of these heat waves and their associated harmful health and environmental effects.\nExit EPA\u2019s website\nThese maps represent the number of heat waves per year (frequency) and the number of days between the first and last heat wave of the year (season length) compared with the local temperature threshold for defining a heat wave across 50 U.S. metropolitan areas.6\nWhen people are exposed to extreme heat, they can suffer from potentially deadly illnesses, such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Hot temperatures can also contribute to deaths from heart attacks, strokes, and other forms of cardiovascular disease. Extreme heat events strain high-risk populations disproportionately. 7, 8, 9 Older adults, young children, people of color, individuals with low-income, outdoor workers, and people in poor health are the most vulnerable to these impacts. For example, Figure 2 shows the difference in death rates between some of these population groups.\nUsing 2004\u20132018 data, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded 10,527 heat-related deaths in the United States, an average of 702 per year. These numbers include deaths where heat was reported as the underlying cause or a contributing cause.10 The actual number of heat-related deaths may be much higher because the cause of death may not be reported as \u201cheat-related\u201d on death certificates.8 Heat-related illnesses vary by geography, occurring most frequently in the Southeast and Midwest.9 In the future, continued warming and increases in heat-related deaths are projected to outweigh reductions in cold-related deaths in most U.S. regions.11\nTo learn more about the health impacts of heat exposure, visit these resources:\nThis graph presents summer (May\u2013September) death rates from 1999 to 2018 for three population groups in the United States. The blue line shows rates for the entire population, the green line shows rates for non-Hispanic Black people, and the pink line shows rates for people aged 65 and older.8\nEfforts to reduce heat islands can help mitigate climate change. In addition to lowering urban temperatures, heat island reduction strategies lessen electricity demand for air conditioning and thereby reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with electricity generation that contribute to climate change. Simultaneously, these measures can help communities become more resilient to climate change impacts. For example:\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Human activity is the principal cause.\nEarth's climate has changed throughout history. Just in the last 800,000 years, there have been eight cycles of ice ages and warmer periods, with the end of the last ice age about 11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era \u2014 and of human civilization. Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth\u2019s orbit that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives.\nThe current warming trend is different because it is clearly the result of human activities since the mid-1800s, and is proceeding at a rate not seen over many recent millennia.1 It is undeniable that human activities have produced the atmospheric gases that have trapped more of the Sun\u2019s energy in the Earth system. This extra energy has warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land, and widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred.\nEarth-orbiting satellites and new technologies have helped scientists see the big picture, collecting many different types of information about our planet and its climate all over the world. These data, collected over many years, reveal the signs and patterns of a changing climate.\nScientists demonstrated the heat-trapping nature of carbon dioxide and other gases in the mid-19th century.2 Many of the science instruments NASA uses to study our climate focus on how these gases affect the movement of infrared radiation through the atmosphere. From the measured impacts of increases in these gases, there is no question that increased greenhouse gas levels warm Earth in response.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nIce cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that Earth\u2019s climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly 10 times faster than the average rate of warming after an ice age. Carbon dioxide from human activities is increasing about 250 times faster than it did from natural sources after the last Ice Age.3\nThe planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and other human activities.4 Most of the warming occurred in the past 40 years, with the seven most recent years being the warmest. The years 2016 and 2020 are tied for the warmest year on record.5 Image credit: Ashwin Kumar, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic.\nThe ocean has absorbed much of this increased heat, with the top 100 meters (about 328 feet) of ocean showing warming of 0.67 degrees Fahrenheit (0.33 degrees Celsius) since 1969.6 Earth stores 90% of the extra energy in the ocean. Image credit: Kelsey Roberts/USGS\nThe Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass. Data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment show Greenland lost an average of 279 billion tons of ice per year between 1993 and 2019, while Antarctica lost about 148 billion tons of ice per year.7 Image: The Antarctic Peninsula, Credit: NASA\nGlaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world \u2014 including in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska, and Africa.8 Image: Miles Glacier, Alaska Image credit: NASA\nSatellite observations reveal that the amount of spring snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere has decreased over the past five decades and the snow is melting earlier.9 Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\nGlobal sea level rose about 8 inches (20 centimeters) in the last century. The rate in the last two decades, however, is nearly double that of the last century and accelerating slightly every year.10 Image credit: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Norfolk District\nBoth the extent and thickness of Arctic sea ice has declined rapidly over the last several decades.11 Credit: NASA's Scientific Visualization Studio\nThe number of record high temperature events in the United States has been increasing, while the number of record low temperature events has been decreasing, since 1950. The U.S. has also witnessed increasing numbers of intense rainfall events.12 Image credit: R\u00e9gine Fabri, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons\nSince the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the acidity of surface ocean waters has increased by about 30%.13, 14 This increase is due to humans emitting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and hence more being absorbed into the ocean. The ocean has absorbed between 20% and 30% of total anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions in recent decades (7.2 to 10.8 billion metric tons per year).15, 16 Image credit: NOAA\n1.

These scientists were interested chiefly in the possibility that a lower level of carbon dioxide gas might explain the ice ages of the distant past. At the turn of the century, Svante Arrhenius calculated that emissions from human industry might someday bring a global warming. Other scientists dismissed his idea as faulty. In 1938, G.S. Callendar argued that the level of carbon dioxide was climbing and raising global temperature, but most scientists found his arguments implausible. It was almost by chance that a few researchers in the 1950s discovered that global warming truly was possible. In the early 1960s, C.D. Keeling measured the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere: it was rising fast. Researchers began to take an interest, struggling to understand how the level of carbon dioxide had changed in the past, and how the level was influenced by chemical and biological forces. By 2000, computer calculations along with evidence from ancient climates showed unequivocally that human emissions of the gas were raising Earth's temperature. Attention turned to studying how the gas was emitted or taken up by natural systems as well as by humanity, how far the temperature would rise, and what could be done to avoid disaster by curbing emissions.

At the turn of the century, Svante Arrhenius calculated that emissions from human industry might someday bring a global warming. Other scientists dismissed his idea as faulty. In 1938, G.S.

By 2000, computer calculations along with evidence from ancient climates showed unequivocally that human emissions of the gas were raising Earth's temperature. Attention turned to studying how the gas was emitted or taken up by natural systems as well as by humanity, how far the temperature would rise, and what could be done to avoid disaster by curbing emissions.
