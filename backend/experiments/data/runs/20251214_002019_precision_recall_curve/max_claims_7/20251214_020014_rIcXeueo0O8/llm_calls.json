The information, is included for historical interest only, and should not be relied upon for accuracy for current air quality control procedures or standards.\nOn Oct. 14, 1947, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors established the nation's first air pollution control program by creating the Los Angeles County Air Pollution Control District. This year, 1997, marks the 50th anniversary of an epic war on smog that has been characterized by continual progress.\nThe following is the complete text of a[n out-of-print] brochure titled \"The Southland's War on Smog: 50 Years of Progress on Clean Air\" on the early years of Air Pollution Control history in the Los Angeles Metropolitan area.\nContents:\nThe Arrival of Air Pollution\nRecognizing the Problem\nBirth of the First United Air Pollution Agency\nUnraveling the Mystery of Smog\nEarly Smog Control Efforts\nThe Birth of Modern Pollution Control\nCleaning Up Cars\nCleaning Up Fuels\nTargeting the Total Package: Clean Fuels and Clean Vehicles\nFormation of the South Coast Air Quality Management District\nEnvisioning the End of Smog\nToxic Air Pollutants\nBeyond the Smokestack and Tailpipe\nFostering Advanced Technologies\nGrowth, the Never-Ending Challenge\nAfter 50 Years, How Close Are We to the Goal?\nSidebars:\nFrom Inner Tubes to Ultraviolet Rays: The Evolution of Air Quality Monitoring\nCan't We Just Blow All this Smog Away?\nThe Clean Air Quest: What You Can Do (PDF)\nFirst recorded photo of smog in Los Angeles, 1943\n(Photo courtesy of Los Angeles Times Collection, Department of Special Collections, UCLA Library).\nOn July 26, 1943, in the midst of World War II, Los Angeles was attacked -- not by a foreign enemy, but a domestic one -- smog.\nTheLos Angeles Timesreported that a pall of smoke and fumes descended on downtown, cutting visibility to three blocks. Striking in the midst of a heat wave, the \"gas attack\" was nearly unbearable, gripping workers and residents with an eye-stinging, throat-scraping sensation. It also left them with a realization that something had gone terribly wrong in their city, prized for its sunny climate.\nThe following day, city officials pointed the finger at the Southern California Gas Co.'s. Aliso Street plant, which manufactured butadiene, an ingredient in synthetic rubber. Public pressure temporarily shuttered the plant, but the gas attacks persisted, proving that it was not the prime culprit.\nThat summer's \"gas attack\" was the opening shot in an epic war on smog, which now has been waged for more than half a century. From a ban on backyard trash incinerators to reformulated gasoline, and from inventing the automotive catalytic converter to developing zero-emission fuel-cell electric vehicles, the fight against air pollution has inspired technological innovations and touched off heated political battles. Controlling air pollution has always ignited public controversy.\nA look at the past fifty-some years of air pollution control shows how far we've come, and yet how far we still have to go to achieve clean air. It demonstrates that victory over smog can be achieved and that all residents of the Los Angeles Basin can breathe air that meets public health standards.\nSouthern California Gas Co. officials spent $1.5 million in 1946 to eliminate butadiene fumes from their Aliso Street plant by completely enclosing the manufacturing process.\n(Photo courtesy of Los Angeles Times Collection, Department of Special Collections, UCLA Library)\n[Return to Top]\nMarion E. Lent dabs at smog-induced tears on her way to work in downtown Los Angeles on Feb. 4, 1953.\n(Photo courtesy of Los Angeles Times Collection, Department of Special Collections, UCLA Library)\nLos Angeles suffered from smog well before World War II. Industrial smoke and fumes were so thick during one day in 1903 that residents mistook it for an eclipse of the sun. From 1905 to 1912, the Los Angeles City Council adopted several measures to combat dense smoke emissions. As the century progressed, the city sprawled and industry boomed, overwhelming those first primitive air pollution control measures.\nWorld War II dramatically increased the region's industrial base and resulting air pollution. The city's population and motor vehicle fleet grew rapidly as well. As a result, according to weather records, visibility declined rapidly from 1939 to 1943.\nAngelenos grew increasingly alarmed at the smoke that clouded their vision and the fumes that filled their lungs.\nPolluting smoke was so dense and pervasive it constituted a \"serious menace\" to aviation, according to the county's health officer. Officials at the Monrovia airport reportedly considered moving the airfield to escape the pall.\nIn October 1943, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors appointed a Smoke and Fumes Commission to study the problem. Following their recommendations, supervisors in February 1945 banned emissions of dense smoke and established an office of Director of Air Pollution Control. The City of Los Angeles adopted a similar smoke regulation the same year, but the other 45 cities in the county took little or no action.\nDuring the war, Angelenos perceived smoke from factories as the No. 1 air pollution culprit. In August 1945, the Pasadena Star-News published a series of articles by county Health Officer Dr. H.O. Swartout who asserted that smog, in fact, came from many sources: smoke-belching locomotives and diesel trucks, burning rubbish in back yard incinerators and city dumps and the combustion of scrap lumber in sawmills. Swartout even correctly identified the region's mountain ranges, relatively stagnant winds and atmospheric temperature inversions as major contributors to Southland smog.\nIn late 1946, the Los Angeles Times hired air pollution expert Raymond R. Tucker of St. Louis to analyze the Los Angeles smog problem and make recommendations to correct it. In a major treatise published in the Times, Tucker reinforced the notion that it w\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

It prevents the heat from escaping back into space at night. This ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nHere, we review information on how plants face redox imbalance caused by climate change, and focus on the role of nitric oxide (NO) in this response. Life on Earth is possible thanks to greenhouse effect. Without it, temperature on Earth\u2019s surface would be around -19\u00b0C, instead of the current average of 14\u00b0C. Greenhouse effect is produced by greenhouse gasses (GHG) like water vapor, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxides (NxO) and ozone (O3). GHG have natural and anthropogenic origin. However, increasing GHG provokes extreme climate changes such as floods, droughts and heat, which induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress in plants. The main sources of ROS in stress conditions are: augmented photorespiration, NADPH oxidase (NOX) activity, \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids and disorders in the electron transport chains of mitochondria and chloroplasts. Plants have developed an antioxidant machinery that includes the activity of ROS detoxifying enzymes [e.g., superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and peroxiredoxin (PRX)], as well as antioxidant molecules such as ascorbic acid (ASC) and glutathione (GSH) that are present in almost all subcellular compartments. CO2 and NO help to maintain the redox equilibrium. Higher CO2 concentrations increase the photosynthesis through the CO2-unsaturated Rubisco activity. But Rubisco photorespiration and NOX activities could also augment ROS production. NO regulate the ROS concentration preserving balance among ROS, GSH, GSNO, and ASC. When ROS are in huge concentration, NO induces transcription and activity of SOD, APX, and CAT. However, when ROS are necessary (e.g., for pathogen resistance), NO may inhibit APX, CAT, and NOX activity by the S-nitrosylation of cysteine residues, favoring cell death. NO also regulates GSH concentration in several ways. NO may react with GSH to form GSNO, the NO cell reservoir and main source of S-nitrosylation. GSNO could be decomposed by the GSNO reductase (GSNOR) to GSSG which, in turn, is reduced to GSH by glutathione reductase (GR). GSNOR may be also inhibited by S-nitrosylation and GR activated by NO. In conclusion, NO plays a central role in the tolerance of plants to climate change.\nKeywords: climate change, greenhouse effect, oxidative stress, nitric oxide, plants\nLife on Earth, as it is, relies on the natural atmospheric greenhouse effect. This is the result of a process in which a planet\u2019s atmosphere traps the sun radiation and warms the planet\u2019s surface.\nGreenhouse effect occurs in the troposphere (the lower atmosphere layer), where life and weather occur. In the absence of greenhouse effect, the average temperature on Earth\u2019s surface is estimated around -19\u00b0C, instead of the current average of 14\u00b0C (Le Treut et al., 2007). Greenhouse effect is produced by greenhouse gasses (GHG). GHG are those gaseous constituents of the atmosphere that absorb and emit radiation in the thermal infrared range (IPCC, 2014). Traces of GHG, both natural and anthropogenic, are present in the troposphere. The most abundant GHG in increasing order of importance are: water vapor, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxides (NxO) and ozone (O3) (Kiehl and Trenberth, 1997). GHG percentages vary daily, seasonally, and annually.\nWater is present in the troposphere both as vapor and clouds. Water vapor was reported by Tyndal in 1861 as the most important gaseous absorber of variations in infrared radiation (cited in Held and Souden, 2000). Further accurate calculation estimate that water vapor and clouds are responsible for 49 and 25%, respectively, of the long wave (thermal) absorption (Schmidt et al., 2010). However, atmospheric lifetime of water vapor is short (days) compared to other GHG as CO2 (years) (IPCC, 2014).\nWater vapor concentrations are not directly influenced by anthropogenic activity and vary regionally. However, human activity increases global temperatures and water vapor formation indirectly, amplifying the warming in a process known as water vapor feedback (Soden et al., 2005).\nCarbon dioxide is responsible for 20% of the thermal absorption (Schmidt et al., 2010).\nNatural sources of CO2 include organic decomposition, ocean release and respiration. Anthropogenic CO2 sources are derived from activities such as cement manufacturing, deforestation, fossil fuels combustion such as coal, oil and natural gas, etc. Surprisingly, 24% of direct CO2 emission comes from agriculture, forestry and other land use, and 21% comes from industry (IPCC, 2014).\nAtmospheric CO2 concentrations climbed up dramatically in the past two centuries, rising from around 270 \u03bcmol.mol-1 in 1750 to present concentrations higher than 385 \u03bcmol.mol-1 (Mittler and Blumwald, 2010; IPCC, 2014). Around 50% of cumulative anthropogenic CO2 emissions between 1750 and 2010 have taken place since the 1970s (IPCC, 2014). It is calculated that the temperature rise produced by high CO2 concentrations, plus the water positive feedback, would increase by 3\u20135\u00b0C the global mean surface temperature in 2100 (IPCC, 2014).\nMethane (CH4) is the main atmospheric organic trace gas. CH4 is the primary component of natural gas, a worldwide fuel source. Significant emissions of CH4 result from cattle farming and agriculture, but mainly as a consequence of fossil fuel use. Concentrations of CH4 were multiplied by two since the pre-industrial era. The present worldwide-averaged concentration is of 1.8 \u03bcmol.mol-1 (IPCC, 2014).\nAlthough its concentration represents only 0.5% that of CO2, concerns arise regarding a jump in CH4 atmospheric release. Indeed, it is 30 times more powerful than CO2 as GHG (IPCC, 2014). CH4 generates O3 (see below), and along with carbon monoxide (CO), contributes to control the amount of OH in the troposphere (Wuebbles and Hayhoe, 2002).\nNitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) are GHG.

However, it may be challenging due to the requirement of high measurement precision and sufficiently enhanced signals. We developed a new active AirCore system based on the previous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) version, which is capable of sampling atmospheric air for several hours aboard a lightweight aircraft for postflight simultaneous and continuous measurements of N2O, CH4, CO2, and CO. We performed 13 flights over the urban areas of Groningen, Utrecht, and Rotterdam and evaluated the aircraft-based AirCore measurements against in situ continuous CH4 measurements. One flight was selected for each of the three urban areas to quantify the emissions of N2O and CH4. Compared to the Dutch inventory, the estimated N2O emissions (364 \u00b1 143 kg h\u20131) from the Rotterdam area are \u223c3 times larger, whereas those for Groningen (95 \u00b1 90 kg h\u20131) and Utrecht (32 \u00b1 16 kg h\u20131) are not significantly different. The estimated CH4 emissions for all three urban areas (Groningen: 2534 \u00b1 1774 kg CH4 hr\u20131, Utrecht: 1440 \u00b1 628 kg CH4 hr\u20131, and Rotterdam: 2419 \u00b1 922 kg CH4 hr\u20131) are not significantly different from the Dutch inventory. The innovative aircraft-based active AirCore sampling system provides a robust means of high-precision and continuous measurements of multiple gas species, which is useful for quantifying GHG emissions from urban areas.\nThis publication is licensed under\nInnovative airborne AirCore sampling reveals significant underestimation of N2O emissions in Rotterdam, which provides a useful tool to evaluate urban greenhouse gas emissions.\nFigure 1. Flow diagrams of the active AirCore system: (a) for the AirCore sampling and (b) for the AirCore sample analysis. The air samples are analyzed using two Picarro analyzers connected in series. Each analyzer has two proportional valves, one at the inlet and one at the outlet. Of these, 1 and 4 are controlled using the analyzer software (i.e., inlet control mode for the G5310 and outlet control mode for the G2401-m), 2 is set to be fully open, and 3 is manually set to a fixed value. Alternatively, analyzers (e.g., a single QCLS system) may be employed instead of the dual-Picarro setup depicted here.\nFigure 2. 3D flight track and 2D map of retrieved AirCore measurements of mole fractions for N2O (left column) and CH4 (right column) for flight 0906. The base map is made using map tiles by Stamen Design (CC BY 3.0) and geographic data from OpenStreetMap (ODbL).\nFigure 3. Comparison of AirCore and LI-7810 measurements for CH4.\nMean concentration of single edge of the downwind/upwind transect as the background: the uncertainty is represented by the combination of the variability of background (sd) and the measurement precision. Only one edge of downwind/upwind transects shows stable and low concentrations over Groningen because the flight track did not frame the enhancement plume.\nLinear function derived from both edges of the downwind/upwind transect as the background due to the concentration gradient between two edges: the uncertainty of background is represented by the systematic uncertainty and the measurement precision. The systematic uncertainty is the standard deviation of the residuals between the modeled values from the linear function and observed values.\nMean concentration of the upwind transect as the background: the uncertainty is represented by the combination of the variability of background (sd) and the measurement precision.\nThe average enhancements and their uncertainties. The uncertainties are derived by summing the background uncertainty (real numbers rather than the rounded numbers shown in the table) and the plume uncertainty in quadrature. The plume uncertainty is represented by the measurement precision, 0.1 ppb for N2O and 1 ppb for CH4.\nFigure 4. Comparison of mass balance fluxes and emission inventory-based estimates of Groningen, Rotterdam, and Utrecht for N2O and CH4. The mass balance fluxes are shown by the blue bar with uncertainties indicated by the error bars; the inventory-based estimates are shown by the stacked color bar, and different colors indicate the emissions from different sectors.\nThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.3c04932.\nAirCore spatial resolution calculation, retrieval of AirCore flight measurements, mass balance flux calculation and its uncertainty estimation, and theoretical analysis of mass balance estimation (PDF)\nMost electronic Supporting Information files are available without a subscription to ACS Web Editions.

The most common greenhouse gases are (in order of atmospheric concentration) water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and a suite of halogen-bearing gases (like fluorocarbons) that are derived from industrial activities. With the exception of water vapor, industrial processes and land use changes have significantly increased the total volume of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere over the past one and a half centuries, leading to a more than 1 degree C (2 degrees F) increase in average global temperature since the pre-industrial era. The relative impact of each type of greenhouse gas is a function of its concentration, its ability to absorb and radiate energy, and the length of time it remains in the atmosphere.\nEuropean Environment Agency, National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Global Monitoring Laboratory and Global Temperature Time Series.\nEarth\u2019s atmosphere is composed almost entirely of the gases nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), but several gases that exist in trace amounts\u2014concentrations of less than a fraction of a percent\u2014have an outsize impact on Earth\u2019s climate. These are greenhouse gases\u2014gases that allow solar radiation to pass through the atmosphere and warm the Earth, but that absorb the heat that the Earth radiates back to space, trapping it like a comforter traps body heat to keep us warm on a cold night. Small changes in the atmospheric concentration of these gases (for example going from 0.02% to 0.2% of the atmosphere) can lead to big changes in Earth\u2019s temperature and climate, making the difference between ice ages, when mastodons roamed the Earth, and the sweltering heat in which the dinosaurs lived.\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) is the most abundant greenhouse gas. Each year, hundreds to thousands of times more CO2 is emitted into the atmosphere by human activity than any other greenhouse gas. However, other gases like methane, nitrous oxide, and halogenated compounds (industrial-derived gases that contain fluorine, chlorine, or bromine) have an outsize greenhouse effect relative to their concentration because of two critical characteristics: their radiative efficiency and their atmospheric residence time.\nRadiative efficiency is a greenhouse gas\u2019s ability to absorb energy and radiate it back to Earth. Atmospheric lifetime is a measure of how long a gas stays in the atmosphere before natural processes remove it (e.g., through breakdown via chemical reactions, or cycling into the ocean or biosphere).\nIn order to compare the relative impact of different greenhouse gases, these characteristics are incorporated into a measurement called the Global Warming Potential (GWP). GWP is a measure of the radiative efficiency of each unit of gas (by mass) over a specified period of time, expressed relative to the radiative efficiency of carbon dioxide (CO2). GWP is often calculated over 100 years, though it can be done for any time period. Gases with GWPs greater than one will warm the Earth more than an equal amount of CO2 over the same period, and the higher the GWP, the greater the warming influence. A gas with a long lifetime, but relatively low radiative efficiency, might exert more warming influence than a gas that has a comparatively high radiative efficiency but leaves the atmosphere faster than the time window of interest. This is reflected in a higher GWP in the long-lived, low radiative efficiency gas.\nThe table below presents atmospheric lifetime and GWP values for the three most significant greenhouse gases and select examples of halogenated compounds (of which there are more than one hundred) from the Sixth IPCC Assessment Report (AR6) released in 2021. These values are periodically updated by the scientific community as new research refines estimates of radiative properties and atmospheric removal mechanisms (sinks) for each gas.\n*Carbon dioxide is quite stable in Earth\u2019s atmosphere, but individual carbon dioxide molecules are in near-constant flux to and from different reservoirs, such as the surface ocean, land plants and animals, soils, and the lithosphere. Some of these fluxes operate on the scale of years, and others on the scale of millennia. As such, no single lifetime can be given for carbon dioxide because it moves throughout the earth\u2019s system at differing rates. A convenient and commonly used estimate for the average CO2 atmospheric lifetime is 100 years.\nSixth Assessment Report (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2021).\nSome gases (like CO2) are made by both natural and manmade processes, while others (like hydrofluorocarbons) are only the result of human industrial activity. The table below shows the relative concentrations of these major greenhouse gases in 1750 (well before the industrial revolution) and in 2019, and their sources. Despite carbon dioxide\u2019s comparatively low GWP among major greenhouse gases, the large human-caused increase in its atmospheric concentration has caused the majority (about 65 percent) of global warming. Methane is similar\u2014despite having a GWP that is also much lower than several other greenhouse gases, it accounts for about 16 percent of warming since pre-industrial times.\n* CO2 is typically reported in parts per million (ppm) but is reported here in parts per billion (ppb) to provide a more direct comparison with the concentrations of other greenhouse gases.\nSixth Assessment Report (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2021), Historical GHG Emissions (ClimateWatch, World Resources Institute).\nThe table also shows the annual emissions rate of each greenhouse gas in 2021, normalized to CO2-equivalent. CO2-equivalent (calculated by multiplying a gas\u2019s GWP with its annual emissions by mass) provides a simple way to compare the relative climate impact of different gases and to understand the total emissions impact of human activities.

A greenhouse is designed to trap heat from the sun's rays inside and acts to keep the plants inside warm, even when it is cold outside. Although the Earth does not have a layer of clear material over it, certain molecules in our atmosphere absorb the Earth's heat, basically trapping some of that energy. This is called the greenhouse effect, and the molecules that trap the heat are called greenhouse gases.\nEven though greenhouse gases don't make a hard surface like the glass of a greenhouse, but because they have a similar effect in keeping our planet warm, the term \"Greenhouse Effect\" is a good description. The greenhouse effect keeps the temperatures on our planet mild and suitable for living things.\nGreenhouse gases (GHG) include carbon dioxide, water vapor, methane, ozone, nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases. These molecules in our atmosphere are called greenhouse gases because they absorb heat. There may not be much of some of these gases in our atmosphere, but they can have a big impact. These molecules eventually release the heat energy and it is often absorbed by another greenhouse gas molecule.\nMore technically: Greenhouse gases effectively absorb thermal infrared radiation, emitted by the Earth's surface, by the atmosphere itself due to the same gases, and by clouds. Atmospheric radiation is emitted to all sides, including downward to the Earth's surface. Thus, greenhouse gases trap heat within the surface-troposphere system. This is called the greenhouse effect.

This year, 1997, marks the 50th anniversary of an epic war on smog that has been characterized by continual progress.\nThe following is the complete text of a[n out-of-print] brochure titled \"The Southland's War on Smog: 50 Years of Progress on Clean Air\" on the early years of Air Pollution Control history in the Los Angeles Metropolitan area.\nContents:\nThe Arrival of Air Pollution\nRecognizing the Problem\nBirth of the First United Air Pollution Agency\nUnraveling the Mystery of Smog\nEarly Smog Control Efforts\nThe Birth of Modern Pollution Control\nCleaning Up Cars\nCleaning Up Fuels\nTargeting the Total Package: Clean Fuels and Clean Vehicles\nFormation of the South Coast Air Quality Management District\nEnvisioning the End of Smog\nToxic Air Pollutants\nBeyond the Smokestack and Tailpipe\nFostering Advanced Technologies\nGrowth, the Never-Ending Challenge\nAfter 50 Years, How Close Are We to the Goal?\nSidebars:\nFrom Inner Tubes to Ultraviolet Rays: The Evolution of Air Quality Monitoring\nCan't We Just Blow All this Smog Away?\nThe Clean Air Quest: What You Can Do (PDF)\nFirst recorded photo of smog in Los Angeles, 1943\n(Photo courtesy of Los Angeles Times Collection, Department of Special Collections, UCLA Library).\nOn July 26, 1943, in the midst of World War II, Los Angeles was attacked -- not by a foreign enemy, but a domestic one -- smog.\nTheLos Angeles Timesreported that a pall of smoke and fumes descended on downtown, cutting visibility to three blocks. Striking in the midst of a heat wave, the \"gas attack\" was nearly unbearable, gripping workers and residents with an eye-stinging, throat-scraping sensation. It also left them with a realization that something had gone terribly wrong in their city, prized for its sunny climate.\nThe following day, city officials pointed the finger at the Southern California Gas Co.'s. Aliso Street plant, which manufactured butadiene, an ingredient in synthetic rubber. Public pressure temporarily shuttered the plant, but the gas attacks persisted, proving that it was not the prime culprit.\nThat summer's \"gas attack\" was the opening shot in an epic war on smog, which now has been waged for more than half a century. From a ban on backyard trash incinerators to reformulated gasoline, and from inventing the automotive catalytic converter to developing zero-emission fuel-cell electric vehicles, the fight against air pollution has inspired technological innovations and touched off heated political battles. Controlling air pollution has always ignited public controversy.\nA look at the past fifty-some years of air pollution control shows how far we've come, and yet how far we still have to go to achieve clean air. It demonstrates that victory over smog can be achieved and that all residents of the Los Angeles Basin can breathe air that meets public health standards.\nSouthern California Gas Co. officials spent $1.5 million in 1946 to eliminate butadiene fumes from their Aliso Street plant by completely enclosing the manufacturing process.\n(Photo courtesy of Los Angeles Times Collection, Department of Special Collections, UCLA Library)\n[Return to Top]\nMarion E. Lent dabs at smog-induced tears on her way to work in downtown Los Angeles on Feb. 4, 1953.\n(Photo courtesy of Los Angeles Times Collection, Department of Special Collections, UCLA Library)\nLos Angeles suffered from smog well before World War II. Industrial smoke and fumes were so thick during one day in 1903 that residents mistook it for an eclipse of the sun. From 1905 to 1912, the Los Angeles City Council adopted several measures to combat dense smoke emissions. As the century progressed, the city sprawled and industry boomed, overwhelming those first primitive air pollution control measures.\nWorld War II dramatically increased the region's industrial base and resulting air pollution. The city's population and motor vehicle fleet grew rapidly as well. As a result, according to weather records, visibility declined rapidly from 1939 to 1943.\nAngelenos grew increasingly alarmed at the smoke that clouded their vision and the fumes that filled their lungs.\nPolluting smoke was so dense and pervasive it constituted a \"serious menace\" to aviation, according to the county's health officer. Officials at the Monrovia airport reportedly considered moving the airfield to escape the pall.\nIn October 1943, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors appointed a Smoke and Fumes Commission to study the problem. Following their recommendations, supervisors in February 1945 banned emissions of dense smoke and established an office of Director of Air Pollution Control. The City of Los Angeles adopted a similar smoke regulation the same year, but the other 45 cities in the county took little or no action.\nDuring the war, Angelenos perceived smoke from factories as the No. 1 air pollution culprit. In August 1945, the Pasadena Star-News published a series of articles by county Health Officer Dr. H.O. Swartout who asserted that smog, in fact, came from many sources: smoke-belching locomotives and diesel trucks, burning rubbish in back yard incinerators and city dumps and the combustion of scrap lumber in sawmills. Swartout even correctly identified the region's mountain ranges, relatively stagnant winds and atmospheric temperature inversions as major contributors to Southland smog.\nIn late 1946, the Los Angeles Times hired air pollution expert Raymond R. Tucker of St. Louis to analyze the Los Angeles smog problem and make recommendations to correct it. In a major treatise published in the Times, Tucker reinforced the notion that it w\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Collectively ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nHere, we review information on how plants face redox imbalance caused by climate change, and focus on the role of nitric oxide (NO) in this response. Life on Earth is possible thanks to greenhouse effect. Without it, temperature on Earth\u2019s surface would be around -19\u00b0C, instead of the current average of 14\u00b0C. Greenhouse effect is produced by greenhouse gasses (GHG) like water vapor, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxides (NxO) and ozone (O3). GHG have natural and anthropogenic origin. However, increasing GHG provokes extreme climate changes such as floods, droughts and heat, which induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress in plants. The main sources of ROS in stress conditions are: augmented photorespiration, NADPH oxidase (NOX) activity, \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids and disorders in the electron transport chains of mitochondria and chloroplasts. Plants have developed an antioxidant machinery that includes the activity of ROS detoxifying enzymes [e.g., superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and peroxiredoxin (PRX)], as well as antioxidant molecules such as ascorbic acid (ASC) and glutathione (GSH) that are present in almost all subcellular compartments. CO2 and NO help to maintain the redox equilibrium. Higher CO2 concentrations increase the photosynthesis through the CO2-unsaturated Rubisco activity. But Rubisco photorespiration and NOX activities could also augment ROS production. NO regulate the ROS concentration preserving balance among ROS, GSH, GSNO, and ASC. When ROS are in huge concentration, NO induces transcription and activity of SOD, APX, and CAT. However, when ROS are necessary (e.g., for pathogen resistance), NO may inhibit APX, CAT, and NOX activity by the S-nitrosylation of cysteine residues, favoring cell death. NO also regulates GSH concentration in several ways. NO may react with GSH to form GSNO, the NO cell reservoir and main source of S-nitrosylation. GSNO could be decomposed by the GSNO reductase (GSNOR) to GSSG which, in turn, is reduced to GSH by glutathione reductase (GR). GSNOR may be also inhibited by S-nitrosylation and GR activated by NO. In conclusion, NO plays a central role in the tolerance of plants to climate change.\nKeywords: climate change, greenhouse effect, oxidative stress, nitric oxide, plants\nLife on Earth, as it is, relies on the natural atmospheric greenhouse effect. This is the result of a process in which a planet\u2019s atmosphere traps the sun radiation and warms the planet\u2019s surface.\nGreenhouse effect occurs in the troposphere (the lower atmosphere layer), where life and weather occur. In the absence of greenhouse effect, the average temperature on Earth\u2019s surface is estimated around -19\u00b0C, instead of the current average of 14\u00b0C (Le Treut et al., 2007). Greenhouse effect is produced by greenhouse gasses (GHG). GHG are those gaseous constituents of the atmosphere that absorb and emit radiation in the thermal infrared range (IPCC, 2014). Traces of GHG, both natural and anthropogenic, are present in the troposphere. The most abundant GHG in increasing order of importance are: water vapor, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxides (NxO) and ozone (O3) (Kiehl and Trenberth, 1997). GHG percentages vary daily, seasonally, and annually.\nWater is present in the troposphere both as vapor and clouds. Water vapor was reported by Tyndal in 1861 as the most important gaseous absorber of variations in infrared radiation (cited in Held and Souden, 2000). Further accurate calculation estimate that water vapor and clouds are responsible for 49 and 25%, respectively, of the long wave (thermal) absorption (Schmidt et al., 2010). However, atmospheric lifetime of water vapor is short (days) compared to other GHG as CO2 (years) (IPCC, 2014).\nWater vapor concentrations are not directly influenced by anthropogenic activity and vary regionally. However, human activity increases global temperatures and water vapor formation indirectly, amplifying the warming in a process known as water vapor feedback (Soden et al., 2005).\nCarbon dioxide is responsible for 20% of the thermal absorption (Schmidt et al., 2010).\nNatural sources of CO2 include organic decomposition, ocean release and respiration. Anthropogenic CO2 sources are derived from activities such as cement manufacturing, deforestation, fossil fuels combustion such as coal, oil and natural gas, etc. Surprisingly, 24% of direct CO2 emission comes from agriculture, forestry and other land use, and 21% comes from industry (IPCC, 2014).\nAtmospheric CO2 concentrations climbed up dramatically in the past two centuries, rising from around 270 \u03bcmol.mol-1 in 1750 to present concentrations higher than 385 \u03bcmol.mol-1 (Mittler and Blumwald, 2010; IPCC, 2014). Around 50% of cumulative anthropogenic CO2 emissions between 1750 and 2010 have taken place since the 1970s (IPCC, 2014). It is calculated that the temperature rise produced by high CO2 concentrations, plus the water positive feedback, would increase by 3\u20135\u00b0C the global mean surface temperature in 2100 (IPCC, 2014).\nMethane (CH4) is the main atmospheric organic trace gas. CH4 is the primary component of natural gas, a worldwide fuel source. Significant emissions of CH4 result from cattle farming and agriculture, but mainly as a consequence of fossil fuel use. Concentrations of CH4 were multiplied by two since the pre-industrial era. The present worldwide-averaged concentration is of 1.8 \u03bcmol.mol-1 (IPCC, 2014).\nAlthough its concentration represents only 0.5% that of CO2, concerns arise regarding a jump in CH4 atmospheric release. Indeed, it is 30 times more powerful than CO2 as GHG (IPCC, 2014). CH4 generates O3 (see below), and along with carbon monoxide (CO), contributes to control the amount of OH in the troposphere (Wuebbles and Hayhoe, 2002).\nNitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) are GHG.

The most common greenhouse gases are (in order of atmospheric concentration) water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and a suite of halogen-bearing gases (like fluorocarbons) that are derived from industrial activities. With the exception of water vapor, industrial processes and land use changes have significantly increased the total volume of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere over the past one and a half centuries, leading to a more than 1 degree C (2 degrees F) increase in average global temperature since the pre-industrial era. The relative impact of each type of greenhouse gas is a function of its concentration, its ability to absorb and radiate energy, and the length of time it remains in the atmosphere.\nEuropean Environment Agency, National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Global Monitoring Laboratory and Global Temperature Time Series.\nEarth\u2019s atmosphere is composed almost entirely of the gases nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), but several gases that exist in trace amounts\u2014concentrations of less than a fraction of a percent\u2014have an outsize impact on Earth\u2019s climate. These are greenhouse gases\u2014gases that allow solar radiation to pass through the atmosphere and warm the Earth, but that absorb the heat that the Earth radiates back to space, trapping it like a comforter traps body heat to keep us warm on a cold night. Small changes in the atmospheric concentration of these gases (for example going from 0.02% to 0.2% of the atmosphere) can lead to big changes in Earth\u2019s temperature and climate, making the difference between ice ages, when mastodons roamed the Earth, and the sweltering heat in which the dinosaurs lived.\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) is the most abundant greenhouse gas. Each year, hundreds to thousands of times more CO2 is emitted into the atmosphere by human activity than any other greenhouse gas. However, other gases like methane, nitrous oxide, and halogenated compounds (industrial-derived gases that contain fluorine, chlorine, or bromine) have an outsize greenhouse effect relative to their concentration because of two critical characteristics: their radiative efficiency and their atmospheric residence time.\nRadiative efficiency is a greenhouse gas\u2019s ability to absorb energy and radiate it back to Earth. Atmospheric lifetime is a measure of how long a gas stays in the atmosphere before natural processes remove it (e.g., through breakdown via chemical reactions, or cycling into the ocean or biosphere).\nIn order to compare the relative impact of different greenhouse gases, these characteristics are incorporated into a measurement called the Global Warming Potential (GWP). GWP is a measure of the radiative efficiency of each unit of gas (by mass) over a specified period of time, expressed relative to the radiative efficiency of carbon dioxide (CO2). GWP is often calculated over 100 years, though it can be done for any time period. Gases with GWPs greater than one will warm the Earth more than an equal amount of CO2 over the same period, and the higher the GWP, the greater the warming influence. A gas with a long lifetime, but relatively low radiative efficiency, might exert more warming influence than a gas that has a comparatively high radiative efficiency but leaves the atmosphere faster than the time window of interest. This is reflected in a higher GWP in the long-lived, low radiative efficiency gas.\nThe table below presents atmospheric lifetime and GWP values for the three most significant greenhouse gases and select examples of halogenated compounds (of which there are more than one hundred) from the Sixth IPCC Assessment Report (AR6) released in 2021. These values are periodically updated by the scientific community as new research refines estimates of radiative properties and atmospheric removal mechanisms (sinks) for each gas.\n*Carbon dioxide is quite stable in Earth\u2019s atmosphere, but individual carbon dioxide molecules are in near-constant flux to and from different reservoirs, such as the surface ocean, land plants and animals, soils, and the lithosphere. Some of these fluxes operate on the scale of years, and others on the scale of millennia. As such, no single lifetime can be given for carbon dioxide because it moves throughout the earth\u2019s system at differing rates. A convenient and commonly used estimate for the average CO2 atmospheric lifetime is 100 years.\nSixth Assessment Report (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2021).\nSome gases (like CO2) are made by both natural and manmade processes, while others (like hydrofluorocarbons) are only the result of human industrial activity. The table below shows the relative concentrations of these major greenhouse gases in 1750 (well before the industrial revolution) and in 2019, and their sources. Despite carbon dioxide\u2019s comparatively low GWP among major greenhouse gases, the large human-caused increase in its atmospheric concentration has caused the majority (about 65 percent) of global warming.

A greenhouse is designed to trap heat from the sun's rays inside and acts to keep the plants inside warm, even when it is cold outside. Although the Earth does not have a layer of clear material over it, certain molecules in our atmosphere absorb the Earth's heat, basically trapping some of that energy. This is called the greenhouse effect, and the molecules that trap the heat are called greenhouse gases.\nEven though greenhouse gases don't make a hard surface like the glass of a greenhouse, but because they have a similar effect in keeping our planet warm, the term \"Greenhouse Effect\" is a good description. The greenhouse effect keeps the temperatures on our planet mild and suitable for living things.\nGreenhouse gases (GHG) include carbon dioxide, water vapor, methane, ozone, nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases. These molecules in our atmosphere are called greenhouse gases because they absorb heat. There may not be much of some of these gases in our atmosphere, but they can have a big impact. These molecules eventually release the heat energy and it is often absorbed by another greenhouse gas molecule.\nMore technically: Greenhouse gases effectively absorb thermal infrared radiation, emitted by the Earth's surface, by the atmosphere itself due to the same gases, and by clouds. Atmospheric radiation is emitted to all sides, including downward to the Earth's surface. Thus, greenhouse gases trap heat within the surface-troposphere system. This is called the greenhouse effect.

Although a ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nHere, we review information on how plants face redox imbalance caused by climate change, and focus on the role of nitric oxide (NO) in this response. Life on Earth is possible thanks to greenhouse effect. Without it, temperature on Earth\u2019s surface would be around -19\u00b0C, instead of the current average of 14\u00b0C. Greenhouse effect is produced by greenhouse gasses (GHG) like water vapor, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxides (NxO) and ozone (O3). GHG have natural and anthropogenic origin. However, increasing GHG provokes extreme climate changes such as floods, droughts and heat, which induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress in plants. The main sources of ROS in stress conditions are: augmented photorespiration, NADPH oxidase (NOX) activity, \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids and disorders in the electron transport chains of mitochondria and chloroplasts. Plants have developed an antioxidant machinery that includes the activity of ROS detoxifying enzymes [e.g., superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and peroxiredoxin (PRX)], as well as antioxidant molecules such as ascorbic acid (ASC) and glutathione (GSH) that are present in almost all subcellular compartments. CO2 and NO help to maintain the redox equilibrium. Higher CO2 concentrations increase the photosynthesis through the CO2-unsaturated Rubisco activity. But Rubisco photorespiration and NOX activities could also augment ROS production. NO regulate the ROS concentration preserving balance among ROS, GSH, GSNO, and ASC. When ROS are in huge concentration, NO induces transcription and activity of SOD, APX, and CAT. However, when ROS are necessary (e.g., for pathogen resistance), NO may inhibit APX, CAT, and NOX activity by the S-nitrosylation of cysteine residues, favoring cell death. NO also regulates GSH concentration in several ways. NO may react with GSH to form GSNO, the NO cell reservoir and main source of S-nitrosylation. GSNO could be decomposed by the GSNO reductase (GSNOR) to GSSG which, in turn, is reduced to GSH by glutathione reductase (GR). GSNOR may be also inhibited by S-nitrosylation and GR activated by NO. In conclusion, NO plays a central role in the tolerance of plants to climate change.\nKeywords: climate change, greenhouse effect, oxidative stress, nitric oxide, plants\nLife on Earth, as it is, relies on the natural atmospheric greenhouse effect. This is the result of a process in which a planet\u2019s atmosphere traps the sun radiation and warms the planet\u2019s surface.\nGreenhouse effect occurs in the troposphere (the lower atmosphere layer), where life and weather occur. In the absence of greenhouse effect, the average temperature on Earth\u2019s surface is estimated around -19\u00b0C, instead of the current average of 14\u00b0C (Le Treut et al., 2007). Greenhouse effect is produced by greenhouse gasses (GHG). GHG are those gaseous constituents of the atmosphere that absorb and emit radiation in the thermal infrared range (IPCC, 2014). Traces of GHG, both natural and anthropogenic, are present in the troposphere. The most abundant GHG in increasing order of importance are: water vapor, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxides (NxO) and ozone (O3) (Kiehl and Trenberth, 1997). GHG percentages vary daily, seasonally, and annually.\nWater is present in the troposphere both as vapor and clouds. Water vapor was reported by Tyndal in 1861 as the most important gaseous absorber of variations in infrared radiation (cited in Held and Souden, 2000). Further accurate calculation estimate that water vapor and clouds are responsible for 49 and 25%, respectively, of the long wave (thermal) absorption (Schmidt et al., 2010). However, atmospheric lifetime of water vapor is short (days) compared to other GHG as CO2 (years) (IPCC, 2014).\nWater vapor concentrations are not directly influenced by anthropogenic activity and vary regionally. However, human activity increases global temperatures and water vapor formation indirectly, amplifying the warming in a process known as water vapor feedback (Soden et al., 2005).\nCarbon dioxide is responsible for 20% of the thermal absorption (Schmidt et al., 2010).\nNatural sources of CO2 include organic decomposition, ocean release and respiration. Anthropogenic CO2 sources are derived from activities such as cement manufacturing, deforestation, fossil fuels combustion such as coal, oil and natural gas, etc. Surprisingly, 24% of direct CO2 emission comes from agriculture, forestry and other land use, and 21% comes from industry (IPCC, 2014).\nAtmospheric CO2 concentrations climbed up dramatically in the past two centuries, rising from around 270 \u03bcmol.mol-1 in 1750 to present concentrations higher than 385 \u03bcmol.mol-1 (Mittler and Blumwald, 2010; IPCC, 2014). Around 50% of cumulative anthropogenic CO2 emissions between 1750 and 2010 have taken place since the 1970s (IPCC, 2014). It is calculated that the temperature rise produced by high CO2 concentrations, plus the water positive feedback, would increase by 3\u20135\u00b0C the global mean surface temperature in 2100 (IPCC, 2014).\nMethane (CH4) is the main atmospheric organic trace gas. CH4 is the primary component of natural gas, a worldwide fuel source. Significant emissions of CH4 result from cattle farming and agriculture, but mainly as a consequence of fossil fuel use. Concentrations of CH4 were multiplied by two since the pre-industrial era. The present worldwide-averaged concentration is of 1.8 \u03bcmol.mol-1 (IPCC, 2014).\nAlthough its concentration represents only 0.5% that of CO2, concerns arise regarding a jump in CH4 atmospheric release. Indeed, it is 30 times more powerful than CO2 as GHG (IPCC, 2014). CH4 generates O3 (see below), and along with carbon monoxide (CO), contributes to control the amount of OH in the troposphere (Wuebbles and Hayhoe, 2002).\nNitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) are GHG.

With the exception of water vapor, industrial processes and land use changes have significantly increased the total volume of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere over the past one and a half centuries, leading to a more than 1 degree C (2 degrees F) increase in average global temperature since the pre-industrial era. The relative impact of each type of greenhouse gas is a function of its concentration, its ability to absorb and radiate energy, and the length of time it remains in the atmosphere.\nEuropean Environment Agency, National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Global Monitoring Laboratory and Global Temperature Time Series.\nEarth\u2019s atmosphere is composed almost entirely of the gases nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), but several gases that exist in trace amounts\u2014concentrations of less than a fraction of a percent\u2014have an outsize impact on Earth\u2019s climate. These are greenhouse gases\u2014gases that allow solar radiation to pass through the atmosphere and warm the Earth, but that absorb the heat that the Earth radiates back to space, trapping it like a comforter traps body heat to keep us warm on a cold night. Small changes in the atmospheric concentration of these gases (for example going from 0.02% to 0.2% of the atmosphere) can lead to big changes in Earth\u2019s temperature and climate, making the difference between ice ages, when mastodons roamed the Earth, and the sweltering heat in which the dinosaurs lived.\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) is the most abundant greenhouse gas. Each year, hundreds to thousands of times more CO2 is emitted into the atmosphere by human activity than any other greenhouse gas. However, other gases like methane, nitrous oxide, and halogenated compounds (industrial-derived gases that contain fluorine, chlorine, or bromine) have an outsize greenhouse effect relative to their concentration because of two critical characteristics: their radiative efficiency and their atmospheric residence time.\nRadiative efficiency is a greenhouse gas\u2019s ability to absorb energy and radiate it back to Earth. Atmospheric lifetime is a measure of how long a gas stays in the atmosphere before natural processes remove it (e.g., through breakdown via chemical reactions, or cycling into the ocean or biosphere).\nIn order to compare the relative impact of different greenhouse gases, these characteristics are incorporated into a measurement called the Global Warming Potential (GWP). GWP is a measure of the radiative efficiency of each unit of gas (by mass) over a specified period of time, expressed relative to the radiative efficiency of carbon dioxide (CO2). GWP is often calculated over 100 years, though it can be done for any time period. Gases with GWPs greater than one will warm the Earth more than an equal amount of CO2 over the same period, and the higher the GWP, the greater the warming influence. A gas with a long lifetime, but relatively low radiative efficiency, might exert more warming influence than a gas that has a comparatively high radiative efficiency but leaves the atmosphere faster than the time window of interest. This is reflected in a higher GWP in the long-lived, low radiative efficiency gas.\nThe table below presents atmospheric lifetime and GWP values for the three most significant greenhouse gases and select examples of halogenated compounds (of which there are more than one hundred) from the Sixth IPCC Assessment Report (AR6) released in 2021.

These heat-trapping greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide (CO2) ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nGreenhouse gases are molecules in our atmosphere that absorb heat radiating from Earth\u2019s surface, preventing it from being emitted into space. The most common greenhouse gases are (in order of atmospheric concentration) water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and a suite of halogen-bearing gases (like fluorocarbons) that are derived from industrial activities. With the exception of water vapor, industrial processes and land use changes have significantly increased the total volume of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere over the past one and a half centuries, leading to a more than 1 degree C (2 degrees F) increase in average global temperature since the pre-industrial era. The relative impact of each type of greenhouse gas is a function of its concentration, its ability to absorb and radiate energy, and the length of time it remains in the atmosphere.\nEuropean Environment Agency, National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Global Monitoring Laboratory and Global Temperature Time Series.\nEarth\u2019s atmosphere is composed almost entirely of the gases nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), but several gases that exist in trace amounts\u2014concentrations of less than a fraction of a percent\u2014have an outsize impact on Earth\u2019s climate. These are greenhouse gases\u2014gases that allow solar radiation to pass through the atmosphere and warm the Earth, but that absorb the heat that the Earth radiates back to space, trapping it like a comforter traps body heat to keep us warm on a cold night. Small changes in the atmospheric concentration of these gases (for example going from 0.02% to 0.2% of the atmosphere) can lead to big changes in Earth\u2019s temperature and climate, making the difference between ice ages, when mastodons roamed the Earth, and the sweltering heat in which the dinosaurs lived.\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) is the most abundant greenhouse gas. Each year, hundreds to thousands of times more CO2 is emitted into the atmosphere by human activity than any other greenhouse gas. However, other gases like methane, nitrous oxide, and halogenated compounds (industrial-derived gases that contain fluorine, chlorine, or bromine) have an outsize greenhouse effect relative to their concentration because of two critical characteristics: their radiative efficiency and their atmospheric residence time.\nRadiative efficiency is a greenhouse gas\u2019s ability to absorb energy and radiate it back to Earth. Atmospheric lifetime is a measure of how long a gas stays in the atmosphere before natural processes remove it (e.g., through breakdown via chemical reactions, or cycling into the ocean or biosphere).\nIn order to compare the relative impact of different greenhouse gases, these characteristics are incorporated into a measurement called the Global Warming Potential (GWP). GWP is a measure of the radiative efficiency of each unit of gas (by mass) over a specified period of time, expressed relative to the radiative efficiency of carbon dioxide (CO2). GWP is often calculated over 100 years, though it can be done for any time period. Gases with GWPs greater than one will warm the Earth more than an equal amount of CO2 over the same period, and the higher the GWP, the greater the warming influence. A gas with a long lifetime, but relatively low radiative efficiency, might exert more warming influence than a gas that has a comparatively high radiative efficiency but leaves the atmosphere faster than the time window of interest. This is reflected in a higher GWP in the long-lived, low radiative efficiency gas.\nThe table below presents atmospheric lifetime and GWP values for the three most significant greenhouse gases and select examples of halogenated compounds (of which there are more than one hundred) from the Sixth IPCC Assessment Report (AR6) released in 2021.

Larger emissions of greenhouse gases lead to higher concentrations in the atmosphere. Greenhouse gas concentrations are measured in parts per million, parts per billion, and even parts per trillion. One part per million is equivalent to one drop of water diluted into about 13 gallons of liquid (roughly the fuel tank of a compact car). To learn more about the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, visit the Climate Change Indicators: Atmospheric Concentrations of Greenhouse Gases page.\nEach of these gases can remain in the atmosphere for different amounts of time, ranging from a few years to thousands of years. All these gases remain in the atmosphere long enough to become well mixed, meaning that the amount that is measured in the atmosphere is roughly the same all over the world, regardless of the source of the emissions.\nSome gases are more effective than others at making the planet warmer and \"thickening the Earth's atmospheric blanket.\"\nFor each greenhouse gas, a Global Warming Potential (GWP) was developed to allow comparisons of the global warming impacts of different gases. Specifically, it is a measure of how much energy the emissions of 1 ton of a gas will absorb over a given period of time, typically a 100-year time horizon, relative to the emissions of 1 ton of carbon dioxide (CO2). Gases with a higher GWP absorb more energy, per ton emitted, than gases with a lower GWP, and thus contribute more to warming Earth.\nNote: All emission estimates are sourced from the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990\u20132022. The Inventory uses 100-year GWPs from IPCC\u2019s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5).\nA million metric tons equals about 2.2 billion pounds, or 1 trillion grams. For comparison, a small car is likely to weigh a little more than 1 metric ton. Thus, a million metric tons is roughly the same mass as 1 million small cars!\nThe U.S. GHG Inventory uses metric units for consistency and comparability with other countries. For reference, a metric ton is slightly more (approximately 10%) than a U.S. \"short\" ton.\nGHG emissions are often measured in carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent. To convert emissions of a gas into CO2 equivalent, its emissions are multiplied by the gas's Global Warming Potential (GWP). The GWP takes into account the fact that many gases are more effective at warming Earth than CO2, per unit mass.\nThe GWP values appearing in the Overview of Greenhouse Gases and Sources of Greenhouse Gas web pages reflect the values used in the U.S. GHG Inventory, which are drawn from the IPCC\u2019s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). For further discussion of GWPs and an estimate of GHG emissions using updated GWPs, see Annex 6 of the U.S. GHG Inventory and the IPCC's discussion on GWPs (pdf)Exit EPA\u2019s website.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Greenhouse effect is produced by greenhouse gasses (GHG) like water vapor, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxides (NxO) and ozone (O3). GHG have natural and anthropogenic origin. However, increasing GHG provokes extreme climate changes such as floods, droughts and heat, which induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress in plants. The main sources of ROS in stress conditions are: augmented photorespiration, NADPH oxidase (NOX) activity, \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids and disorders in the electron transport chains of mitochondria and chloroplasts. Plants have developed an antioxidant machinery that includes the activity of ROS detoxifying enzymes [e.g., superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and peroxiredoxin (PRX)], as well as antioxidant molecules such as ascorbic acid (ASC) and glutathione (GSH) that are present in almost all subcellular compartments. CO2 and NO help to maintain the redox equilibrium. Higher CO2 concentrations increase the photosynthesis through the CO2-unsaturated Rubisco activity. But Rubisco photorespiration and NOX activities could also augment ROS production. NO regulate the ROS concentration preserving balance among ROS, GSH, GSNO, and ASC. When ROS are in huge concentration, NO induces transcription and activity of SOD, APX, and CAT. However, when ROS are necessary (e.g., for pathogen resistance), NO may inhibit APX, CAT, and NOX activity by the S-nitrosylation of cysteine residues, favoring cell death. NO also regulates GSH concentration in several ways. NO may react with GSH to form GSNO, the NO cell reservoir and main source of S-nitrosylation. GSNO could be decomposed by the GSNO reductase (GSNOR) to GSSG which, in turn, is reduced to GSH by glutathione reductase (GR). GSNOR may be also inhibited by S-nitrosylation and GR activated by NO. In conclusion, NO plays a central role in the tolerance of plants to climate change.\nKeywords: climate change, greenhouse effect, oxidative stress, nitric oxide, plants\nLife on Earth, as it is, relies on the natural atmospheric greenhouse effect. This is the result of a process in which a planet\u2019s atmosphere traps the sun radiation and warms the planet\u2019s surface.\nGreenhouse effect occurs in the troposphere (the lower atmosphere layer), where life and weather occur. In the absence of greenhouse effect, the average temperature on Earth\u2019s surface is estimated around -19\u00b0C, instead of the current average of 14\u00b0C (Le Treut et al., 2007). Greenhouse effect is produced by greenhouse gasses (GHG). GHG are those gaseous constituents of the atmosphere that absorb and emit radiation in the thermal infrared range (IPCC, 2014). Traces of GHG, both natural and anthropogenic, are present in the troposphere. The most abundant GHG in increasing order of importance are: water vapor, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxides (NxO) and ozone (O3) (Kiehl and Trenberth, 1997). GHG percentages vary daily, seasonally, and annually.\nWater is present in the troposphere both as vapor and clouds. Water vapor was reported by Tyndal in 1861 as the most important gaseous absorber of variations in infrared radiation (cited in Held and Souden, 2000). Further accurate calculation estimate that water vapor and clouds are responsible for 49 and 25%, respectively, of the long wave (thermal) absorption (Schmidt et al., 2010). However, atmospheric lifetime of water vapor is short (days) compared to other GHG as CO2 (years) (IPCC, 2014).\nWater vapor concentrations are not directly influenced by anthropogenic activity and vary regionally. However, human activity increases global temperatures and water vapor formation indirectly, amplifying the warming in a process known as water vapor feedback (Soden et al., 2005).\nCarbon dioxide is responsible for 20% of the thermal absorption (Schmidt et al., 2010).\nNatural sources of CO2 include organic decomposition, ocean release and respiration. Anthropogenic CO2 sources are derived from activities such as cement manufacturing, deforestation, fossil fuels combustion such as coal, oil and natural gas, etc. Surprisingly, 24% of direct CO2 emission comes from agriculture, forestry and other land use, and 21% comes from industry (IPCC, 2014).\nAtmospheric CO2 concentrations climbed up dramatically in the past two centuries, rising from around 270 \u03bcmol.mol-1 in 1750 to present concentrations higher than 385 \u03bcmol.mol-1 (Mittler and Blumwald, 2010; IPCC, 2014). Around 50% of cumulative anthropogenic CO2 emissions between 1750 and 2010 have taken place since the 1970s (IPCC, 2014). It is calculated that the temperature rise produced by high CO2 concentrations, plus the water positive feedback, would increase by 3\u20135\u00b0C the global mean surface temperature in 2100 (IPCC, 2014).\nMethane (CH4) is the main atmospheric organic trace gas. CH4 is the primary component of natural gas, a worldwide fuel source. Significant emissions of CH4 result from cattle farming and agriculture, but mainly as a consequence of fossil fuel use. Concentrations of CH4 were multiplied by two since the pre-industrial era. The present worldwide-averaged concentration is of 1.8 \u03bcmol.mol-1 (IPCC, 2014).\nAlthough its concentration represents only 0.5% that of CO2, concerns arise regarding a jump in CH4 atmospheric release. Indeed, it is 30 times more powerful than CO2 as GHG (IPCC, 2014). CH4 generates O3 (see below), and along with carbon monoxide (CO), contributes to control the amount of OH in the troposphere (Wuebbles and Hayhoe, 2002).\nNitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) are GHG.

Nitrogen and phosphorus are commonly used in agriculture, lawns, and other human activities.\n\nFull Page Content:\nFor centuries, keeping farmland in production has been critical to the economy and our nation\u2019s food security system. But increasingly, the State of California is recognizing the importance of preserving this land to help fight climate change, as noted in the 2030 Natural and Working Lands Climate Change Implementation Plan. Farmland offers open spaces and habitat for wildlife. It provides a buffer against development, which would mean more streets, traffic and greenhouse gas emissions.\nA big key to farm efficiency and a healthy environment isthe increasingly sophisticated use of fertilizers. Plants, like people, require nutrients to be healthy. By keeping plants healthy, fertilizers are responsible for strong roots, which prevents soil erosion and in turn protects green spaces and promotes biodiverse habitats.\nHealthy plants not only produce oxygen essential for all living things, but they contribute to the fight against climate change by absorbing massive amounts of carbon (CO2) from the atmosphere. A just released report by the California Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office estimates that modern fertilizers only contribute about one percent of the total greenhouse gases being emitted from all contributing urban and rural sources. However, a recent study by Stanford University estimates that healthy plants and soils absorb about 30 percent of total CO2 emitted. It is hard to imagine a more environmentally beneficial tradeoff for Californians than using fertilizers to promote healthy plants, who can then through photosynthesis convert massive amounts of CO2 into oxygen.\nWhile fertilizers are vital, there has been concerns raised about the potential contributions of nitrates leaching into groundwater aquifers. In response, California\u2019s fertilizer industry has been funding the Fertilizer Research & Education Program (FREP). Overseen by the California Department of Agriculture, for over 30 years FREP has led the country in fertilizer research and grower education to promote the agronomically sound and environmentally safe use of nitrogen products.\nIn keeping with their desire to be better environmental stewards of their land, thousands of farmers are utilizing this fertilizer industry funded program to learn how to improve the way they use water and fertilizers. The fertilizer industry is currently funding over $2,000,000 a year in grower education programs to help farmers maximize advanced management practices which will minimize potential nutrient impacts to water quality. FREP is a terrific example of a public-private partnership that is promoting best practices that allow farmers to keep their land in production while protecting the environment. Whether we are looking at water or air quality, the use of advanced fertilizers are helping to assure that agricultural contributions that impact our environment are minimized, while still maximizing the removal of greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. If California wants to continue to lead on pumping up the green in our state, fertilizers will need to play a role.\nBy Renee Pinel\nShare\nFollow Us\n\u00a9 2020 Western Plant Health.

This report summarizes the latest evidence on whether greenhouse gas emissions threaten public health and welfare in the United States.

The report\u2019s authoring committee found that EPA\u2019s 2009 finding that human-caused emissions of greenhouse gases adversely affect human health and welfare was accurate, has stood the test of time, and is now reinforced by even stronger evidence.

At the same time, new research shows that synthetic N fertilisers are a major driver of the climate crisis, responsible for 1 out every 40 tonnes of GHGs currently pumped into the atmosphere. As the 26th UN Climate Change Conference gets underway, now is the time for the world to kick its addiction to synthetic N fertilisers and urgently transition to farming without fossil fuels and chemicals.\nThe new research \u2014 undertaken by three scientists working with Greenpeace, IATP and GRAIN \u2014 provides the first estimate of the global climate impacts of synthetic N fertilisers to cover the entire production chain, from manufacturing to soil application. It finds that the production and use of synthetic N fertiliser accounts for 2.4% of global emissions, making it one of the top climate polluting industrial chemicals. The synthetic N fertiliser supply chain was responsible for estimated emissions of 1,250 million tonnes of CO2e in 2018, which is roughly 21.5% of the annual direct emissions from agriculture (5,800 million tonnes). For comparison, the global emissions from commercial aviation in 2018 were around 900 million tonnes of CO2.\nThe majority of emissions from synthetic N fertilisers occur after they are applied to the soil and enter the atmosphere as nitrous oxide (N2O) \u2014 a persistent greenhouse gas with 265 times more global warming potential than CO2. But, what is less discussed is that almost 40% of the greenhouse gas emissions of synthetic N fertilisers occur in production and transport, largely in the form of CO2 caused by the burning of fossil fuels during manufacture. Added up, a full accounting of emissions from synthetic N fertiliser shows how it is a major source of climate pollution that needs to be rapidly and drastically reduced. Synthetic N fertilisers have increased by a whopping 800% since the 1960s according to the IPCC, and the new research confirms that climate pollution from their production and use is on course to get much worse if actions are not taken to reverse these trends (Graphic 1). Worldwide use of synthetic N fertilisers is set to increase by over 50% by 2050, according to the United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organisation.\nGraphic 1. Consumption of synthetic nitrogen fertiliser from 1961-2018, in tonnes of nitrogen\nThe research also finds that emissions from synthetic N fertilisers are highly concentrated in certain geographic areas. The main emitters are China, India ,North America and Europe. But, on a per capita basis, the highest emitters are the big agricultural export countries of North America (U.S. and Canada), South America (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay) Australia/New Zealand and Europe (Denmark, France, Ireland, Ukraine). Worldwide, emissions keep growing every year, including in Africa, where fertiliser use is now growing rapidly.\nSince the 1960s, there has been a concerted effort on the part of the multilateral development banks such as the World Bank, governments, donors and agribusiness corporations to support the widespread adoption of a so-called \"green revolution\" model of agriculture. This model is based on the development and adoption of varieties of certain staple crops (mainly wheat, rice and maize) that are short and stocky (called semi-dwarf) and capable of producing high yields when heavily dosed with chemical fertilisers and sprayed with pesticides. By way of massive government programmes and subsidies, the green revolution varieties quickly replaced local varieties and generated a huge boom in the global use of chemical fertilisers. They also kicked in a vicious cycle, in which more and more chemical fertilisers had to be applied to sustain yields. Today, only around 20-30% of the synthetic N fertilisers applied to fields are converted to foods, with the rest running off into water bodies and entering the environment as pollution. Not only is this heating up the planet, but it is also destroying the ozone layer and causing a global crisis of algae blooms and oceanic \u201cdead zones\u201d. Some say the green revolution enabled production to meet the increasing global demand for food, but the narrow focus on a small number of crops and on varieties dependent on chemical inputs caused numerous environmental and social problems. It also distracted from other approaches that could have increased food production without generating the massive consumption of chemical fertilisers. And it has left the world vulnerable to food price spikes and shortages triggered or exacerbated by rising prices for chemical fertilisers and their inputs, as we are now seeing with the energy crisis hitting many countries. Today, these agro-chemicals are controlled by a small number of global corporations that wield enormous political clout, such as the Norwegian nitrogen fertiliser giant Yara.\nThe fertiliser lobby has spent several decades maintaining that the excessive use of synthetic N fertiliser can be resolved through more precise application -- what they call \"precision agriculture\" or \"climate-smart agriculture\". Yet the new research on synthetic N fertiliser emissions finds no evidence that programmes to increase efficiency have had any significant impact. In most world regions, there has been no significant increase in crop production per unit of synthetic N fertiliser applied (Graphic 2). In Canada, for instance, farmers participating in the fertiliser industry's \"4R Nutrient Stewardship Programme\" have actually ended up using more fertilisers and using them more inefficiently.\nCanada's emissions from synthetic N fertilisers have accelerated in recent years, alongside use rates, making it one of the top emitters of greenhouse gases from synthetic N fertilisers on a per capita basis (Graphic 3).\nGraphic 2.

We developed a new active AirCore system based on the previous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) version, which is capable of sampling atmospheric air for several hours aboard a lightweight aircraft for postflight simultaneous and continuous measurements of N2O, CH4, CO2, and CO. We performed 13 flights over the urban areas of Groningen, Utrecht, and Rotterdam and evaluated the aircraft-based AirCore measurements against in situ continuous CH4 measurements. One flight was selected for each of the three urban areas to quantify the emissions of N2O and CH4. Compared to the Dutch inventory, the estimated N2O emissions (364 \u00b1 143 kg h\u20131) from the Rotterdam area are \u223c3 times larger, whereas those for Groningen (95 \u00b1 90 kg h\u20131) and Utrecht (32 \u00b1 16 kg h\u20131) are not significantly different.

This section provides information on emissions and removals of the main greenhouse gases to and from the atmosphere. Click on a greenhouse gas below to learn about its emissions in more detail.\nAdditional compounds in the atmosphere including solid and liquid aerosol and other greenhouse gases, such as water vapor and ground-level ozone can also impact the climate. Learn more about these compounds and climate change on our Basics of Climate Change page.\nCarbon Dioxide Methane Nitrous Oxide Fluorinated Gases\nEach gas's effect on climate change depends on three main factors:\nVisit EPA\u2019s Basics of Climate Change page to learn more about the effect of greenhouse gases on the Earth\u2019s climate.\nConcentration, or abundance, is the amount of a particular gas in the air. Larger emissions of greenhouse gases lead to higher concentrations in the atmosphere. Greenhouse gas concentrations are measured in parts per million, parts per billion, and even parts per trillion. One part per million is equivalent to one drop of water diluted into about 13 gallons of liquid (roughly the fuel tank of a compact car). To learn more about the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, visit the Climate Change Indicators: Atmospheric Concentrations of Greenhouse Gases page.\nEach of these gases can remain in the atmosphere for different amounts of time, ranging from a few years to thousands of years. All these gases remain in the atmosphere long enough to become well mixed, meaning that the amount that is measured in the atmosphere is roughly the same all over the world, regardless of the source of the emissions.\nSome gases are more effective than others at making the planet warmer and \"thickening the Earth's atmospheric blanket.\"\nFor each greenhouse gas, a Global Warming Potential (GWP) was developed to allow comparisons of the global warming impacts of different gases. Specifically, it is a measure of how much energy the emissions of 1 ton of a gas will absorb over a given period of time, typically a 100-year time horizon, relative to the emissions of 1 ton of carbon dioxide (CO2). Gases with a higher GWP absorb more energy, per ton emitted, than gases with a lower GWP, and thus contribute more to warming Earth.\nNote: All emission estimates are sourced from the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990\u20132022. The Inventory uses 100-year GWPs from IPCC\u2019s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5).\nA million metric tons equals about 2.2 billion pounds, or 1 trillion grams. For comparison, a small car is likely to weigh a little more than 1 metric ton. Thus, a million metric tons is roughly the same mass as 1 million small cars!\nThe U.S. GHG Inventory uses metric units for consistency and comparability with other countries. For reference, a metric ton is slightly more (approximately 10%) than a U.S. \"short\" ton.\nGHG emissions are often measured in carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent. To convert emissions of a gas into CO2 equivalent, its emissions are multiplied by the gas's Global Warming Potential (GWP). The GWP takes into account the fact that many gases are more effective at warming Earth than CO2, per unit mass.\nThe GWP values appearing in the Overview of Greenhouse Gases and Sources of Greenhouse Gas web pages reflect the values used in the U.S. GHG Inventory, which are drawn from the IPCC\u2019s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5).

Many of us don\u2019t often consider how the food we eat - and the chemicals used to grow, package, or prepare it \u2013 can impact the air we breathe and the water we drink.\nSynthetic nitrogen, now used extensively in conventional fertilizers, helps farmers produce higher yields to feed a growing world population. However, when this nitrogen is not fully utilized by the growing plants, they can be lost from the farm fields and negatively impact air and downstream water quality. This excess nitrogen can contribute to increased formation of ground-level ozone, higher amounts of climate changing greenhouse gases, and thinning of the protective ozone layer high in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Excess nitrogen has also contributed to acid rain, polluted drinking water, and caused oxygen depletion and \u201cdead zones\u201d in water bodies, which causes serious harm to aquatic wildlife.\nOver the last five years, EPA scientists have been working on combining advanced modeling technology to improve our understanding of how air and water quality are connected to agriculture and the nitrogen cycle. Dr. Yongping Yuan, an EPA hydrologist whose work focuses on the impacts of agricultural practices on water quality, says that modeling has some limitations, but provides a basis to explore mitigation options for reducing the environmental impact of nitrogen.\nEPA scientists developed the Integrated Multi-Media Modeling System (IMS) which combines agricultural, atmospheric, and hydrological components to look more closely at how air and water pollution are produced through large-scale agricultural operations, particularly related to grain crops and livestock. This modeling system is being used to evaluate the impacts of air quality management policies, land use and land management practices, as well as the impacts of climate change on water quality.\nThe system integrates several powerful EPA and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) models to allow scientists to examine and predict the activity of entire ecosystems and local atmospheric conditions in a specific region or watershed. It is available through the Fertilizer Emission Scenario Tool for CMAQ (FEST-C v1.4.1) Java-based interface.\nThe modeling system also helps scientists achieve more accurate and realistic predictions of the emissions of ammonia from synthetic nitrogen fertilizer, which contributes to the formation of fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Dr. Jon Pleim, an atmospheric scientist at EPA, emphasized the system\u2019s potential for improving the accuracy of PM2.5 predictions by including ammonia, an important precursor of PM2.5. Ammonia is produced through the nitrogen cycle and has been historically difficult to capture in models until now.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have accurate ammonia emissions, then you\u2019re going to have a hard time doing realistic predictions of PM2.5, which is one of the key air pollutants that EPA is concerned about,\u201d he explains.\nAs the work on the modeling system progresses, researchers hope to find out more about the relationship between the atmosphere and water and how it impacts ecosystems.\nRelated Links:\nThe Fertilizer Emission Scenario Tool for CMAQ (FEST-C v1.4.1)Exit EPA\u2019s website is a Java-based interface system that facilitates the integration of agriculture, atmosphere, and hydrology simulations at large scales through the current release of the Spatial Allocator (SA v4.3.2) Raster Tools system.\nJournal Article: Ran, L., Yuan, Y., Cooter, E., Benson, V., Yang, D., Pleim, J., et al.

At the same time, new research shows that synthetic N fertilisers are a major driver of the climate crisis, responsible for 1 out every 40 tonnes of GHGs currently pumped into the atmosphere. As the 26th UN Climate Change Conference gets underway, now is the time for the world to kick its addiction to synthetic N fertilisers and urgently transition to farming without fossil fuels and chemicals.\nThe new research \u2014 undertaken by three scientists working with Greenpeace, IATP and GRAIN \u2014 provides the first estimate of the global climate impacts of synthetic N fertilisers to cover the entire production chain, from manufacturing to soil application. It finds that the production and use of synthetic N fertiliser accounts for 2.4% of global emissions, making it one of the top climate polluting industrial chemicals. The synthetic N fertiliser supply chain was responsible for estimated emissions of 1,250 million tonnes of CO2e in 2018, which is roughly 21.5% of the annual direct emissions from agriculture (5,800 million tonnes). For comparison, the global emissions from commercial aviation in 2018 were around 900 million tonnes of CO2.\nThe majority of emissions from synthetic N fertilisers occur after they are applied to the soil and enter the atmosphere as nitrous oxide (N2O) \u2014 a persistent greenhouse gas with 265 times more global warming potential than CO2. But, what is less discussed is that almost 40% of the greenhouse gas emissions of synthetic N fertilisers occur in production and transport, largely in the form of CO2 caused by the burning of fossil fuels during manufacture. Added up, a full accounting of emissions from synthetic N fertiliser shows how it is a major source of climate pollution that needs to be rapidly and drastically reduced. Synthetic N fertilisers have increased by a whopping 800% since the 1960s according to the IPCC, and the new research confirms that climate pollution from their production and use is on course to get much worse if actions are not taken to reverse these trends (Graphic 1). Worldwide use of synthetic N fertilisers is set to increase by over 50% by 2050, according to the United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organisation.\nGraphic 1. Consumption of synthetic nitrogen fertiliser from 1961-2018, in tonnes of nitrogen\nThe research also finds that emissions from synthetic N fertilisers are highly concentrated in certain geographic areas. The main emitters are China, India ,North America and Europe. But, on a per capita basis, the highest emitters are the big agricultural export countries of North America (U.S. and Canada), South America (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay) Australia/New Zealand and Europe (Denmark, France, Ireland, Ukraine). Worldwide, emissions keep growing every year, including in Africa, where fertiliser use is now growing rapidly.\nSince the 1960s, there has been a concerted effort on the part of the multilateral development banks such as the World Bank, governments, donors and agribusiness corporations to support the widespread adoption of a so-called \"green revolution\" model of agriculture. This model is based on the development and adoption of varieties of certain staple crops (mainly wheat, rice and maize) that are short and stocky (called semi-dwarf) and capable of producing high yields when heavily dosed with chemical fertilisers and sprayed with pesticides. By way of massive government programmes and subsidies, the green revolution varieties quickly replaced local varieties and generated a huge boom in the global use of chemical fertilisers. They also kicked in a vicious cycle, in which more and more chemical fertilisers had to be applied to sustain yields. Today, only around 20-30% of the synthetic N fertilisers applied to fields are converted to foods, with the rest running off into water bodies and entering the environment as pollution. Not only is this heating up the planet, but it is also destroying the ozone layer and causing a global crisis of algae blooms and oceanic \u201cdead zones\u201d. Some say the green revolution enabled production to meet the increasing global demand for food, but the narrow focus on a small number of crops and on varieties dependent on chemical inputs caused numerous environmental and social problems. It also distracted from other approaches that could have increased food production without generating the massive consumption of chemical fertilisers. And it has left the world vulnerable to food price spikes and shortages triggered or exacerbated by rising prices for chemical fertilisers and their inputs, as we are now seeing with the energy crisis hitting many countries. Today, these agro-chemicals are controlled by a small number of global corporations that wield enormous political clout, such as the Norwegian nitrogen fertiliser giant Yara.\nThe fertiliser lobby has spent several decades maintaining that the excessive use of synthetic N fertiliser can be resolved through more precise application -- what they call \"precision agriculture\" or \"climate-smart agriculture\". Yet the new research on synthetic N fertiliser emissions finds no evidence that programmes to increase efficiency have had any significant impact. In most world regions, there has been no significant increase in crop production per unit of synthetic N fertiliser applied (Graphic 2). In Canada, for instance, farmers participating in the fertiliser industry's \"4R Nutrient Stewardship Programme\" have actually ended up using more fertilisers and using them more inefficiently.\nCanada's emissions from synthetic N fertilisers have accelerated in recent years, alongside use rates, making it one of the top emitters of greenhouse gases from synthetic N fertilisers on a per capita basis (Graphic 3).\nGraphic 2.

Farmers do adapt, but that adaptation is partially protective \u2013 not fully protective.\u201d\nThe researchers model the impacts on crop yields under two emissions scenarios \u2013 moderate (RCP4.5) and very high (RCP8.5) \u2013 for two time periods \u2013 2050 and 2098. They select six staple crops for their study: cassava, maize, rice, sorghum, soya bean and wheat.\nFor both emissions scenarios, the researchers apply projected future incomes consistent with SSP3 socioeconomic pathway. This portrays a \u201crocky road\u201d of global development in the future due to rising geopolitical tensions driven by \u201cregional rivalry\u201d.\nUnder the moderate-emissions scenario, they find an overall decrease in staple crop yield of 8.3% in 2050 and 12.7% in 2098.\nHowever, they find that these losses can be reduced somewhat by the introduction of adaptive measures, such as switching to different varieties of a crop or adjusting irrigation levels.\nIn order to account for adaptation, the researchers use data on crop yields from 12,658 sub-national regions to create a model that links changes in yields to exposure to extremely hot days.\nThis allows the researchers to project the impacts of adaptive measures without having to prescribe what, exactly, those measures would be, Hultgren says. Relatively lower losses on extreme heat days are \u201creflective of adaptation\u201d, he adds.\nIn other words, if two regions with similar baseline climates and yields both experience a season of extreme heat, the one that has lower yield losses has more adaptations to climate change.\nFactoring in adaptation and income growth, they find that the yield losses fall to 7.8% in 2050 and 11.2% in 2098 under moderate emissions. While these changes are relatively small, they are not insignificant, Hultgren argues:\n\u201cTwelve percent mitigation of losses is still a globally important amount of gains from adaptation.\u201d\nDr Jyoti Singh, a climate-crop modeller at Columbia University\u2019s Center for Climate Systems Research, tells Carbon Brief that the dataset assembled for the new study is its \u201cmost noteworthy strength\u201d. Singh, who was not involved in the new work, adds that it \u201csignificantly contributes to empirical agricultural impact modelling\u201d.\nHowever, she says, there is a \u201cbig limitation\u201d of the study in that empirical models are based only on past data \u2013 they cannot account for the full range of potential futures. Therefore, the results from the new study cannot be compared directly to results from models that more explicitly represent the processes that influence crop growth, she says.\nThe losses are not equal across all six staples. The end-of-century losses range from just over 1% loss for rice yields to 22.4% loss for soya bean yields. This is because each of the crops has a different response to changes in temperature and rainfall.\nThe change in rice yield is particularly low, Hultgren explains, because the losses associated with overall warming are somewhat counterbalanced by yield increases due to rising nighttime temperatures.\nIn addition to the differences between crops, the researchers identify strong regional differences in the amount of future losses \u2013 as well as the extent to which adaptation will offset these losses.\nIn Africa, for example, the researchers project an overall yield decrease of 16% by 2098 with no adaptive measures in place. Adding in these adaptations reduces that yield loss to 11.6%. By contrast, adding adaptation to projections of staple yields in North America makes almost no change \u2013 reducing the losses from 21.0% to 20.8%.\nThe maps below show the percentage of yield losses for (clockwise from top-left) maize, soya bean, wheat, sorghum, cassava and rice in 2098 under a moderate-warming scenario that factors in adaptation.\nThe maps show that many of the staple crops studied suffer the most significant losses in current \u201cbreadbasket\u201d regions of the world that produce much of the world\u2019s calories, such as the US and Europe.

A greenhouse is designed to trap heat from the sun's rays inside and acts to keep the plants inside warm, even when it is cold outside. Although the Earth does not have a layer of clear material over it, certain molecules in our atmosphere absorb the Earth's heat, basically trapping some of that energy. This is called the greenhouse effect, and the molecules that trap the heat are called greenhouse gases.\nEven though greenhouse gases don't make a hard surface like the glass of a greenhouse, but because they have a similar effect in keeping our planet warm, the term \"Greenhouse Effect\" is a good description. The greenhouse effect keeps the temperatures on our planet mild and suitable for living things.\nGreenhouse gases (GHG) include carbon dioxide, water vapor, methane, ozone, nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases. These molecules in our atmosphere are called greenhouse gases because they absorb heat. There may not be much of some of these gases in our atmosphere, but they can have a big impact. These molecules eventually release the heat energy and it is often absorbed by another greenhouse gas molecule.\nMore technically: Greenhouse gases effectively absorb thermal infrared radiation, emitted by the Earth's surface, by the atmosphere itself due to the same gases, and by clouds. Atmospheric radiation is emitted to all sides, including downward to the Earth's surface. Thus, greenhouse gases trap heat within the surface-troposphere system. This is called the greenhouse effect.

Farmers do adapt, but that adaptation is partially protective \u2013 not fully protective.\u201d\nThe researchers model the impacts on crop yields under two emissions scenarios \u2013 moderate (RCP4.5) and very high (RCP8.5) \u2013 for two time periods \u2013 2050 and 2098. They select six staple crops for their study: cassava, maize, rice, sorghum, soya bean and wheat.\nFor both emissions scenarios, the researchers apply projected future incomes consistent with SSP3 socioeconomic pathway. This portrays a \u201crocky road\u201d of global development in the future due to rising geopolitical tensions driven by \u201cregional rivalry\u201d.\nUnder the moderate-emissions scenario, they find an overall decrease in staple crop yield of 8.3% in 2050 and 12.7% in 2098.\nHowever, they find that these losses can be reduced somewhat by the introduction of adaptive measures, such as switching to different varieties of a crop or adjusting irrigation levels.\nIn order to account for adaptation, the researchers use data on crop yields from 12,658 sub-national regions to create a model that links changes in yields to exposure to extremely hot days.\nThis allows the researchers to project the impacts of adaptive measures without having to prescribe what, exactly, those measures would be, Hultgren says. Relatively lower losses on extreme heat days are \u201creflective of adaptation\u201d, he adds.\nIn other words, if two regions with similar baseline climates and yields both experience a season of extreme heat, the one that has lower yield losses has more adaptations to climate change.\nFactoring in adaptation and income growth, they find that the yield losses fall to 7.8% in 2050 and 11.2% in 2098 under moderate emissions. While these changes are relatively small, they are not insignificant, Hultgren argues:\n\u201cTwelve percent mitigation of losses is still a globally important amount of gains from adaptation.\u201d\nDr Jyoti Singh, a climate-crop modeller at Columbia University\u2019s Center for Climate Systems Research, tells Carbon Brief that the dataset assembled for the new study is its \u201cmost noteworthy strength\u201d. Singh, who was not involved in the new work, adds that it \u201csignificantly contributes to empirical agricultural impact modelling\u201d.\nHowever, she says, there is a \u201cbig limitation\u201d of the study in that empirical models are based only on past data \u2013 they cannot account for the full range of potential futures. Therefore, the results from the new study cannot be compared directly to results from models that more explicitly represent the processes that influence crop growth, she says.\nThe losses are not equal across all six staples. The end-of-century losses range from just over 1% loss for rice yields to 22.4% loss for soya bean yields. This is because each of the crops has a different response to changes in temperature and rainfall.\nThe change in rice yield is particularly low, Hultgren explains, because the losses associated with overall warming are somewhat counterbalanced by yield increases due to rising nighttime temperatures.\nIn addition to the differences between crops, the researchers identify strong regional differences in the amount of future losses \u2013 as well as the extent to which adaptation will offset these losses.\nIn Africa, for example, the researchers project an overall yield decrease of 16% by 2098 with no adaptive measures in place. Adding in these adaptations reduces that yield loss to 11.6%. By contrast, adding adaptation to projections of staple yields in North America makes almost no change \u2013 reducing the losses from 21.0% to 20.8%.\nThe maps below show the percentage of yield losses for (clockwise from top-left) maize, soya bean, wheat, sorghum, cassava and rice in 2098 under a moderate-warming scenario that factors in adaptation.\nThe maps show that many of the staple crops studied suffer the most significant losses in current \u201cbreadbasket\u201d regions of the world that produce much of the world\u2019s calories, such as the US and Europe.

Many of us don\u2019t often consider how the food we eat - and the chemicals used to grow, package, or prepare it \u2013 can impact the air we breathe and the water we drink.\nSynthetic nitrogen, now used extensively in conventional fertilizers, helps farmers produce higher yields to feed a growing world population. However, when this nitrogen is not fully utilized by the growing plants, they can be lost from the farm fields and negatively impact air and downstream water quality. This excess nitrogen can contribute to increased formation of ground-level ozone, higher amounts of climate changing greenhouse gases, and thinning of the protective ozone layer high in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Excess nitrogen has also contributed to acid rain, polluted drinking water, and caused oxygen depletion and \u201cdead zones\u201d in water bodies, which causes serious harm to aquatic wildlife.\nOver the last five years, EPA scientists have been working on combining advanced modeling technology to improve our understanding of how air and water quality are connected to agriculture and the nitrogen cycle. Dr. Yongping Yuan, an EPA hydrologist whose work focuses on the impacts of agricultural practices on water quality, says that modeling has some limitations, but provides a basis to explore mitigation options for reducing the environmental impact of nitrogen.\nEPA scientists developed the Integrated Multi-Media Modeling System (IMS) which combines agricultural, atmospheric, and hydrological components to look more closely at how air and water pollution are produced through large-scale agricultural operations, particularly related to grain crops and livestock. This modeling system is being used to evaluate the impacts of air quality management policies, land use and land management practices, as well as the impacts of climate change on water quality.\nThe system integrates several powerful EPA and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) models to allow scientists to examine and predict the activity of entire ecosystems and local atmospheric conditions in a specific region or watershed. It is available through the Fertilizer Emission Scenario Tool for CMAQ (FEST-C v1.4.1) Java-based interface.\nThe modeling system also helps scientists achieve more accurate and realistic predictions of the emissions of ammonia from synthetic nitrogen fertilizer, which contributes to the formation of fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Dr. Jon Pleim, an atmospheric scientist at EPA, emphasized the system\u2019s potential for improving the accuracy of PM2.5 predictions by including ammonia, an important precursor of PM2.5. Ammonia is produced through the nitrogen cycle and has been historically difficult to capture in models until now.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have accurate ammonia emissions, then you\u2019re going to have a hard time doing realistic predictions of PM2.5, which is one of the key air pollutants that EPA is concerned about,\u201d he explains.\nAs the work on the modeling system progresses, researchers hope to find out more about the relationship between the atmosphere and water and how it impacts ecosystems.\nRelated Links:\nThe Fertilizer Emission Scenario Tool for CMAQ (FEST-C v1.4.1)Exit EPA\u2019s website is a Java-based interface system that facilitates the integration of agriculture, atmosphere, and hydrology simulations at large scales through the current release of the Spatial Allocator (SA v4.3.2) Raster Tools system.\nJournal Article: Ran, L., Yuan, Y., Cooter, E., Benson, V., Yang, D., Pleim, J., et al.

Much of this loss has occurred since the 19th century due to deforestation, overgrazing, plow-out of prairies, and drainage of wetlands in order to grow crops, as well as degradative practices such as intensive soil tillage, monoculture cropping, bare fallowing, and heavy reliance on the use of chemical fertilizers and biocides. These agricultural practices damage the microorganisms upon which fertile, carbon-rich soils depend.\nRather than functioning as a source of carbon emissions, croplands can become a carbon sink. At both the regional and global levels, a growing body of scientific literature is identifying the potential of regenerative agricultural practices in sequestering carbon, helping to mitigate climate change while making croplands more productive and resilient as the planet warms. But not all are in agreement.\nIn recent years, some extravagant claims have been made about the potential for soils to absorb as much as 1 trillion tonnes of carbon dioxide. This has caused a reaction by some experts who worry that this new \u201cdarling of policymakers, food companies, and farmers\u201d will derail important mitigation efforts related to energy decarbonization, diet shifts, and other important solutions to climate change. This position is summed up by a recent article from World Resources Institute (WRI), \u201cRegenerative Agriculture: Good for Soil Health\u2026\u201d which presents several criticisms regarding regenerative agriculture as a solution to climate change [2].\nThe response to the WRI article was swift, with leading soil scientists penning a formal rebuttal [3]. Below is a summary of the key points organized by seven key questions about the potential of regenerative agriculture, with points of agreement and disagreement between the two perspectives.\nThere seems to be a lack of clarity from WRI and others regarding the definition of \u201cconservation\u201d agriculture versus the larger umbrella of \u201cregenerative\u201d agriculture. So it\u2019s important to begin by defining regenerative agriculture\u2019s underlying principles, which are widely understood:\nBroadly speaking, these principles are designed to closely mimic a comparable native ecosystem. For example, a grassland prairie, which we know maintains much higher soil carbon stocks than conventional annual croplands in a given region. An array of practices can work to increase the amount of organic carbon added back into the soil while reducing the relative loss from erosion (C) and soil respiration (CO2). For annual croplands, these practices include:\nWRI claims that the efficacy of these practices is up for debate, when in fact, there is now extensive literature representing hundreds of long-term field experiments across the globe that document the carbon sequestration efficiency of cover crops [4,5]; tillage reduction [6,7,8]; and improved grazing land management [9,10]. The field evidence that regenerative agricultural practices can significantly increase soil C stocks is unequivocal. Of course, results vary for different combinations of climate zones, soil types, and management systems. But regionally appropriate regenerative agroecosystems can now be designed with a relatively high degree of certainty about the long-term potential for carbon sequestration.\nWRI flags the potential for \u201cdouble counting\u201d of carbon sequestration, specifically importing carbon through organic amendments such as manure from off-farm sources without accounting for the emissions generated in the production of the manure. It goes without saying that understanding the net impact of such practices requires a broader life cycle assessment, and they may or may not result in a net reduction of greenhouse gas emissions [11]. However, estimates of global soil carbon sequestration potentials based on field experimental data generally do not include off-farm organic amendments as a key practice [12,13,14,15,16,17]. Double counting has, for the most part, been eliminated when estimating the overall potential for soil carbon sequestration.\nWRI speculates that the adoption of regenerative practices might cause significant yield declines compared to conventional agriculture and therefore increase pressure to convert forests to crop production, resulting in more carbon emissions. However, there is evidence demonstrating the potential for increases in agricultural yields resulting from increased soil organic matter [18,19], and yield intensification can result in less pressure for land-use conversion to agriculture. In fact, one of the more attractive features of using soils for carbon dioxide removal is that additional carbon can be stored in the soil without further land-use change. In contrast, land conversion is recognized as one of the major constraints against scaling up other removal approaches, including tree plantations (afforestation) or bioenergy with carbon capture and storage [20].\nSoil scientists widely agree that practices to build up soil carbon will entail building up stocks of organically-bound nitrogen as well, at a ratio of roughly 11 to 1 (carbon to nitrogen). But this doesn\u2019t mean that large amounts of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer will have to be produced to do so, as the WRI commentary implies. If this were the case, then the emissions resulting from the associated industrial fertilizer production would largely negate any climate benefits from the soil carbon sequestration. However, in most annual croplands in the industrialized world, the\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Below is a summary of the key points organized by seven key questions about the potential of regenerative agriculture, with points of agreement and disagreement between the two perspectives.\nThere seems to be a lack of clarity from WRI and others regarding the definition of \u201cconservation\u201d agriculture versus the larger umbrella of \u201cregenerative\u201d agriculture. So it\u2019s important to begin by defining regenerative agriculture\u2019s underlying principles, which are widely understood:\nBroadly speaking, these principles are designed to closely mimic a comparable native ecosystem. For example, a grassland prairie, which we know maintains much higher soil carbon stocks than conventional annual croplands in a given region. An array of practices can work to increase the amount of organic carbon added back into the soil while reducing the relative loss from erosion (C) and soil respiration (CO2). For annual croplands, these practices include:\nWRI claims that the efficacy of these practices is up for debate, when in fact, there is now extensive literature representing hundreds of long-term field experiments across the globe that document the carbon sequestration efficiency of cover crops [4,5]; tillage reduction [6,7,8]; and improved grazing land management [9,10]. The field evidence that regenerative agricultural practices can significantly increase soil C stocks is unequivocal. Of course, results vary for different combinations of climate zones, soil types, and management systems. But regionally appropriate regenerative agroecosystems can now be designed with a relatively high degree of certainty about the long-term potential for carbon sequestration.\nWRI flags the potential for \u201cdouble counting\u201d of carbon sequestration, specifically importing carbon through organic amendments such as manure from off-farm sources without accounting for the emissions generated in the production of the manure. It goes without saying that understanding the net impact of such practices requires a broader life cycle assessment, and they may or may not result in a net reduction of greenhouse gas emissions [11]. However, estimates of global soil carbon sequestration potentials based on field experimental data generally do not include off-farm organic amendments as a key practice [12,13,14,15,16,17]. Double counting has, for the most part, been eliminated when estimating the overall potential for soil carbon sequestration.\nWRI speculates that the adoption of regenerative practices might cause significant yield declines compared to conventional agriculture and therefore increase pressure to convert forests to crop production, resulting in more carbon emissions. However, there is evidence demonstrating the potential for increases in agricultural yields resulting from increased soil organic matter [18,19], and yield intensification can result in less pressure for land-use conversion to agriculture. In fact, one of the more attractive features of using soils for carbon dioxide removal is that additional carbon can be stored in the soil without further land-use change. In contrast, land conversion is recognized as one of the major constraints against scaling up other removal approaches, including tree plantations (afforestation) or bioenergy with carbon capture and storage [20].\nSoil scientists widely agree that practices to build up soil carbon will entail building up stocks of organically-bound nitrogen as well, at a ratio of roughly 11 to 1 (carbon to nitrogen). But this doesn\u2019t mean that large amounts of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer will have to be produced to do so, as the WRI commentary implies. If this were the case, then the emissions resulting from the associated industrial fertilizer production would largely negate any climate benefits from the soil carbon sequestration. However, in most annual croplands in the industrialized world, the\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The PM-10 particle is sufficiently small to move past the natural defenses in the human breathing system and accumulate in our lungs. The PM-2.5 particle is sufficiently small to diffuse from the lungs directly into the bloodstream.\nTo evaluate the profusion of particulate matter, environmental authorities use automatic air samplers. These instruments collect air samples at very specific and constant air flows. Unwanted particulates above the target size are removed by filters, baffles, and very specific air flow designs within the sampler. The remaining particles impinge on a removable filter element which can be gravimetrically analyzed to determine particulate profusion. A few different styles are shown below.\n(Note: this type of equipment not sold or manufactured by Nova)\nEnvironmental standards may be divided into Primary or Secondary Standards which define whether the standards apply to public health protection or public property and mobility.

Therefore, we do not manufacture particulate monitors, opacity monitors, wind velocity meters, and other instruments typically associated with environmental monitoring stations.\nHowever, our industrial gas analyzers are frequently used to help control air pollution at the sources. For example, an out-of-tune combustion process may produce more particulate matter due to improper fuel ratios or combustion conditions. The exhaust gases can be used to determine combustion efficiency which can then be improved if needed. Learn more about point source monitoring of flue gas and emissions applications.\nSteel-making processes, such as electric arc furnaces, can also be optimized and environmentally improved by using gas analysis. The Tenova EFSOP process is an industry-leading example of this.\nIndustrial processes frequently produce toxic gases which may accumulate in areas that are occupied by people. In other cases, there may be storage of compressed gases. A leak may displace the local air and create an oxygen-deficient environment. It is therefore important to monitor these areas for local ambient air quality. The monitoring may be of the toxic gas or of oxygen content, whichever is more immediately dangerous. Some applications require both types of monitoring.\nNon-industrial locations such as laboratories and parking garages also frequently require monitors for indoor air quality reasons.\nOne characteristic of this type of monitoring is in the ranges of analysis. Because many gases are toxic at very low levels, it is of very little use to have analysis ranges that are relevant to process levels. Air monitors should be suitable for levels corresponding to human safety. Thus, many personnel safety monitors have analysis ranges in the low ppm (parts per million).\nIn this type of situation, it is also important to provide some kind of audible or visual alert to notify local personnel that a dangerous situation exists.

From bustling cities to remote mountain sites, the air we breathe can carry particles and pollutants that directly and significantly impact human health and the environment. This underscores the urgency and importance of ambient air sampling as a crucial tool for understanding, regulating, and improving air quality.\nAmbient air sampling is the versatile process of collecting and analyzing particles and gases from outdoor air to assess pollution levels. Unlike indoor air sampling, which focuses on air inside enclosed spaces, ambient sampling can be applied in a variety of environments\u2014whether it's an urban area, an industrial site, or a national park.\nThis process is typically used to detect:\nThe data from these samples supports critical decisions about health regulations, environmental safety, and air pollution mitigation strategies.\nAmbient air pollution is linked to respiratory illness, cardiovascular disease, and premature death. According to the World Health Organization, 99% of the world's population breathes air that exceeds recommended pollution limits.\nAmbient air sampling helps:\nAmbient air sampling plays a vital role in a wide range of sectors, including:\nState and federal environmental protection departments monitor ambient air quality to enforce regulations, issue health advisories, and validate pollution control measures.\nCity planners and health officials use air sampling data to improve community design, prioritize green infrastructure, and protect vulnerable populations.\nUniversities and institutes conduct longitudinal pollution and climate change studies using reference-grade air sampling devices.\nCompanies use air sampling to protect workers from harmful exposures in chemical plants, factories, and construction sites.\nAir quality must be monitored before, during, and after remediation during cleanup operations to ensure safety and compliance.\nMesa Labs' PQ200 sampler is frequently deployed for remediation projects and remote site monitoring due to its solar-powered capabilities and uninterrupted 24-hour sampling duration.\nThere are various ways to collect ambient air samples, each suited to specific pollutants and regulatory requirements.\nThis method involves pulling air through a filter to collect particles for laboratory analysis. It is the foundation of Federal Reference Methods (FRM) approved by the U.S. EPA.\nMesa's PQ100 and PQ200 samplers are designated FRMs for PM10 and PM2.5, ensuring precise, regulation-grade data.\nThese devices draw in large volumes of air to capture more pollutants for detailed analysis. They are often used for TSP (Total Suspended Particulates) and metal speciation.\nAlthough not as accurate as FRM samplers, these instruments provide real-time pollutant readings. They are useful for early warnings and trends.\nThese devices require no power and continuously collect gaseous pollutants over time through diffusion. They are ideal for long-term monitoring in remote or low-maintenance locations.\nCyclones are used to separate airborne particles based on aerodynamic diameter. For example, Mesa\u2019s VSCCA Cyclone is considered the gold standard for accurate PM2.5 separation.\nAdequate air sampling requires precision, durability, flexibility, and compliance with federal regulations. Mesa Labs delivers this with:\nThe EPA, urban health agencies, non-profits, and industrial hygienists alike trust these solutions.\nAmbient air sampling is more than a scientific process\u2014it's a frontline defense against invisible threats in our environment. Whether protecting communities, supporting clean energy transitions, or informing policy, air sampling empowers data-driven decisions that make a measurable impact.\nExplore Mesa's industry-leading environmental controls and air quality solutions built for accuracy, reliability, and real-world demands.

Air pollutants are frequently monitored in environmental stations that may be housed in temporary or permanent structures strategically located throughout a region. These stations are equipped with gas analyzers and particulate samplers.\nDiscussions of air pollution and urban smog often include references to PM-2.5 and PM-10. These terms refer to the size of particulate matter that is entrained in the breathable atmosphere. The numbers in the \u2018PM-\u2018 expressions refer to particle size in micrometers.\nThe implications of the distinction between PM-10 and PM-2.5 are significant. The PM-10 particle is sufficiently small to move past the natural defenses in the human breathing system and accumulate in our lungs. The PM-2.5 particle is sufficiently small to diffuse from the lungs directly into the bloodstream.\nTo evaluate the profusion of particulate matter, environmental authorities use automatic air samplers. These instruments collect air samples at very specific and constant air flows. Unwanted particulates above the target size are removed by filters, baffles, and very specific air flow designs within the sampler. The remaining particles impinge on a removable filter element which can be gravimetrically analyzed to determine particulate profusion.

These stations are equipped with gas analyzers and particulate samplers.\nDiscussions of air pollution and urban smog often include references to PM-2.5 and PM-10. These terms refer to the size of particulate matter that is entrained in the breathable atmosphere. The numbers in the \u2018PM-\u2018 expressions refer to particle size in micrometers.\nThe implications of the distinction between PM-10 and PM-2.5 are significant. The PM-10 particle is sufficiently small to move past the natural defenses in the human breathing system and accumulate in our lungs. The PM-2.5 particle is sufficiently small to diffuse from the lungs directly into the bloodstream.\nTo evaluate the profusion of particulate matter, environmental authorities use automatic air samplers. These instruments collect air samples at very specific and constant air flows. Unwanted particulates above the target size are removed by filters, baffles, and very specific air flow designs within the sampler. The remaining particles impinge on a removable filter element which can be gravimetrically analyzed to determine particulate profusion. A few different styles are shown below.\n(Note: this type of equipment not sold or manufactured by Nova)\nEnvironmental standards may be divided into Primary or Secondary Standards which define whether the standards apply to public health protection or public property and mobility. Gas analysis equipment in environmental monitoring stations is frequently intended to detect and report low level amounts of targeted \u2018criteria pollutants\u2019 such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, PM-2.5, PM-10, sulfur dioxide, lead, ozone, and others.\nNova typically does not participate in environmental monitoring projects because that is not the focus of our product line. Therefore, we do not manufacture particulate monitors, opacity monitors, wind velocity meters, and other instruments typically associated with environmental monitoring stations.\nHowever, our industrial gas analyzers are frequently used to help control air pollution at the sources. For example, an out-of-tune combustion process may produce more particulate matter due to improper fuel ratios or combustion conditions. The exhaust gases can be used to determine combustion efficiency which can then be improved if needed. Learn more about point source monitoring of flue gas and emissions applications.\nSteel-making processes, such as electric arc furnaces, can also be optimized and environmentally improved by using gas analysis. The Tenova EFSOP process is an industry-leading example of this.\nIndustrial processes frequently produce toxic gases which may accumulate in areas that are occupied by people. In other cases, there may be storage of compressed gases. A leak may displace the local air and create an oxygen-deficient environment. It is therefore important to monitor these areas for local ambient air quality. The monitoring may be of the toxic gas or of oxygen content, whichever is more immediately dangerous. Some applications require both types of monitoring.\nNon-industrial locations such as laboratories and parking garages also frequently require monitors for indoor air quality reasons.\nOne characteristic of this type of monitoring is in the ranges of analysis. Because many gases are toxic at very low levels, it is of very little use to have analysis ranges that are relevant to process levels. Air monitors should be suitable for levels corresponding to human safety. Thus, many personnel safety monitors have analysis ranges in the low ppm (parts per million).\nIn this type of situation, it is also important to provide some kind of audible or visual alert to notify local personnel that a dangerous situation exists. The alert mechanisms should be carefully located by the health and safety department of the facility to ensure that adequate warning is given at the best locations.\nPer the above picture labels:\nNova provides a few products that address these situations.\nThe 500 Series is a wall-mounted instrument available with audible and red strobe light alerts for the following gases:\nSome more of these models are visible here.\nSome of these models can be combined into a single analyzer. However, this may not be possible in all cases. Some atmospheres can contain multiple gases that may interfere with analysis of other gases. A monitor can be set up to have internal compensation for some interfering gases, but this is not always possible. Consult with Nova here or here to see if your requirements can be met.\nThe 600 Series is a portable version of the wall-mount ambient air monitor. It may be carried with the user to provide alert of dangerous gas accumulations. Some users have also used this instrument to acquire an approximate baseline level of various gases on an industrial site or in a laboratory.\nThe 600 series instrument is available with a variety of gases that are relevant to portable ambient air monitoring.\nSome of these may be combined into a single analyzer.
