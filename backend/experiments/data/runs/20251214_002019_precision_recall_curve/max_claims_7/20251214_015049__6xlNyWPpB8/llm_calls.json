    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nThis is the story of three plastic bottles, empty and discarded. Their journeys are about to diverge with outcomes that impact nothing less than the fate of the planet. But they weren't always this way. To understand where these bottles end up, we must first explore their origins. The heroes of our story were conceived in this oil refinery. The plastic in their bodies was formed by chemically bonding oil and gas molecules together to make monomers. In turn, these monomers were bonded into long polymer chains to make plastic in the form of millions of pellets. Those were melted at manufacturing plants and reformed in molds to create the resilient material that makes up the triplets' bodies. Machines filled the bottles with sweet bubbily liquid and they were then wrapped, shipped, bought, opened, consumed and unceremoniously discarded. And now here they lie, poised at the edge of the unknown. Bottle one, like hundreds of millions of tons of his plastic brethren, ends up in a landfill. This huge dump expands each day as more trash comes in and continues to take up space. As plastics sit there being compressed amongst layers of other junk, rainwater flows through the waste and absorbs the water-soluble compounds it contains, and some of those are highly toxic. Together, they create a harmful stew called leachate, which can move into groundwater, soil and streams, poisoning ecosystems and harming wildlife. It can take bottle one an agonizing 1,000 years to decompose. Bottle two's journey is stranger but, unfortunately, no happier. He floats on a trickle that reaches a stream, a stream that flows into a river, and a river that reaches the ocean. After months lost at sea, he's slowly drawn into a massive vortex, where trash accumulates, a place known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Here the ocean's currents have trapped millions of pieces of plastic debris. This is one of five plastic-filled gyres in the world's seas. Places where the pollutants turn the water into a cloudy plastic soup. Some animals, like seabirds, get entangled in the mess. They, and others, mistake the brightly colored plastic bits for food. Plastic makes them feel full when they're not, so they starve to death and pass the toxins from the plastic up the food chain. For example, it's eaten by lanternfish, the lanternfish are eaten by squid, the squid are eaten by tuna, and the tuna are eaten by us. And most plastics don't biodegrade, which means they're destined to break down into smaller and smaller pieces called micro plastics, which might rotate in the sea eternally. But bottle three is spared the cruel purgatories of his brothers. A truck brings him to a plant where he and his companions are squeezed flat and compressed into a block. Okay, this sounds pretty bad, too, but hang in there. It gets better. The blocks are shredded into tiny pieces, which are washed and melted, so they become the raw materials that can be used again. As if by magic, bottle three is now ready to be reborn as something completely new. For this bit of plastic with such humble origins, suddenly the sky is the limit.",

There are two basic mechanisms for polymerization: addition reactions and ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nWe use plastics every day, but how exactly are they made?\nAccording to American Chemistry Council:\nThe Basics of Plastic Manufacturing\n\u201cThe term \u2018plastics\u2019 includes materials composed of various elements such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, chlorine, and sulfur. Plastics typically have high molecular weight, meaning each molecule can have thousands of atoms bound together. Naturally occurring materials, such as wood, horn and rosin, are also composed of molecules of high molecular weight. The manufactured or synthetic plastics are often designed to mimic the properties of natural materials. Plastics, also called polymers, are produced by the conversion of natural products or by the synthesis from primary chemicals generally coming from oil, natural gas, or coal.\n\u201cMost plastics are based on the carbon atom. Silicones, which are based on the silicon atom, are an exception. The carbon atom can link to other atoms with up to four chemical bonds. When all of the bonds are to other carbon atoms, diamonds or graphite or carbon black soot may result. For plastics the carbon atoms are also connected to the aforementioned hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, chlorine, or sulfur. When the connections of atoms result in long chains, like pearls on a string of pearls, the polymer is called a thermoplastic. Thermoplastics are characterized by being meltable. The thermoplastics all have repeat units, the smallest section of the chain that is identical. We call these repeat units unit cells. The vast majority of plastics, about 92%, are thermoplastics1.\n\u201cThe groups of atoms that are used to make unit cells are called monomers. For some plastics, such as polyethylene, the repeat unit can be just one carbon atom and two hydrogen atoms. For other plastics, such as nylons, the repeat unit can involve 38 or more atoms. When we combine monomers, we generate polymers or plastics. Raw materials form monomers that can be or are used to form unit cells. Monomers are used form polymers or plastics\n\u201cWhen the connection of the carbon atoms forms two and three-dimensional networks instead of one-dimension chains, the polymer will be a thermoset plastic. Thermoset plastics are characterized by not being meltable. Thermoset plastics, such as epoxy adhesives or unsaturated polyester boat hulls and bathtubs or the phenolic adhesives used to make plywood, are created by the user mixing two chemicals and immediately using the mixture before the plastic \u201csets up\u201d or cures.\n\u201cThe formation of the repeat units for thermoplastics usually begins with the formation of small carbon-based molecules that can be combined to form monomers. The monomers, in turn, are joined together by chemical polymerization mechanisms to form polymers. The raw material formation may begin by separating the hydrocarbon chemicals from natural gas, petroleum, or coal into pure streams of chemicals. Some are then processed in a \u201ccracking process.\u201d Here, in the presence of a catalyst, raw materials molecules are converted into monomers such as ethylene (ethene) C2H4, propylene (propene) C3H6, and butene C4H8 and others. All of these monomers contain double bonds between carbon atoms such that the carbon atoms can subsequently react to form polymers.\n\u201cOther raw material chemicals are isolated from petroleum, such as benzene and xylenes. These chemicals are reacted with others to form the monomers for polystyrene, nylons, and polyesters. The raw materials have been changed into monomers and no longer contain the petroleum fractions. Still other raw materials can be obtained from renewable resources, such as cellulose from wood to make cellulose butyrate. For the polymerization step to work efficiently, the monomers must be very pure. All manufacturers purify raw materials and monomers, capturing unused raw materials for reuse and byproducts for proper disposition.\n\u201cMonomers are then chemically bonded into chains called polymers.There are two basic mechanisms for polymerization: addition reactions and condensation reactions. For addition reactions a special catalyst is added, frequently a peroxide, that causes one monomer to link to the next and that to the next and so on. Catalysts do not cause reactions to occur, but cause the reactions to happen more rapidly. Addition polymerization, used for polyethylene and polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride among others, creates no byproducts. The reactions can be done in the gaseous phase dispersed in liquids. The second polymerization mechanism, condensation polymerization, uses catalysts to have all monomers react with any adjacent monomer. The reaction results in two monomers forming dimers (two unit cells) plus a byproduct. Dimers can combine to form tetramers (four unit cells) and so on. For condensation polymerization the byproducts must be removed for the chemical reaction to produce useful products. Some byproducts are water, which is treated and disposed. Other byproducts are raw materials and recycled for reuse within the process. The removal of byproducts is conducted so that valuable recycled raw materials are not lost to the environment or exposed to populations. Condensation reactions are typically done in a mass of molten polymer. Polyesters and nylons are made by condensation polymerization.\n\u201cDifferent combinations of monomers can yield plastic resins with different properties and characteristics. When all monomers are the same, the polymer is called a homopolymer. When more than one monomer is used, the polymer is called a copolymer. Plastic milk jugs are an example of homopolymer HDPE. Milk is satisfactorily packaged in the less expensive homopolymer HDPE. Laundry detergent bottles are an example of copolymer HDPE. The aggressive nature of the detergent makes a copolymer the right choice for best service function. Each monomer yields a plastic resin with specific properties and characteristics. Combinations of monomers produce copolymers with further property variations. So, within each polymer type, s\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Here's how you know we're official.\nAnimals have been eating, or ingesting, plastic and other marine debris for a long time. The ingestion of plastic by wildlife was first observed in 1966, when researchers found plastic container lids and toys in dead Laysan albatross chicks. These observations happened more than 20 years before the Great Pacific Garbage Patch was discovered. A review by Kuhn and van Franeker(link is external) found that over 700 species, including seabirds, fish, turtles, and marine mammals, have been confirmed to eat plastic. That number will likely increase over time as wildlife continues to encounter our trash.\nDebris items may be mistaken for food and ingested, or may be accidentally ingested when mixed with or attached to an animal's natural food. Because many plastics float, break into small, easily eaten pieces, and are colorful, they are more likely to attract hungry animals than other types of marine debris. Eating plastic may lead to loss of nutrition, internal injury, intestinal blockage, starvation, and even death. We know that ingested plastic is harmful to animals, and research is still being conducted to figure out all the effects, especially to communities and wild populations.\nPlankton, shellfish, birds, fish, marine mammals, and sea turtles from all parts of the globe and from various depths of the ocean have been confirmed to ingest plastic debris. The amount and type of plastic they eat often relates directly to the animal\u2019s feeding behavior. Passive feeders, or animals that filter their food from water or soil, may unintentionally eat microplastics with their food. Animals that are active feeders, that search for and capture their food, ingest plastic not only accidentally while feeding, but also any debris inside of their prey.\nSome animals are able to release debris without passing it fully into the digestive system, such as birds that can regurgitate, or throw up indigestible materials. Debris can also pass completely through the digestive system for many animals depending on its shape and size. If an animal is not able to regurgitate or pass marine debris through their system, it can cause serious health problems. Sharp or rough plastic marine debris can create cuts in the digestive system, leading to infection and internal bleeding. It can also block their digestive system, making them feel full, reducing their urge to eat, and making it difficult for the animal to get the nutrients they need.\nPlastic can also carry harmful pollutants. They may absorb pollutants that are in the water around them, or release chemicals that are added to plastics during production to make them colorful or flexible. These chemicals may enter the body of an animal if ingested. Whether an animal eats the plastic itself, or eats an animal that has already eaten plastic, there could be possible health impacts on marine wildlife. Although wildlife may be exposed to these contaminants from plastics, more research is needed to understand how they might be affected, depending on the size of the plastics and how long they stay in an animal.\nSea Turtles: All seven species of sea turtles have been confirmed to eat marine debris. Sea turtles most commonly try to eat plastic sheeting and plastic bags, which may resemble their jellyfish prey. This type of debris can get stuck in their digestive system, making them feel full. Since they no longer feel hungry, they lose the urge to feed which can lead to poor nutrition and starvation. A review by K\u00fchn and van Franeker(link is external) estimated that 32% of turtles have plastic marine debris in their stomachs. Learn more about how ingesting marine debris affects turtles with the University of North Carolina Wilmington\u2019s MarineQuest Turtle Trash Collectors Interactive Video.\nBirds: The impacts of marine debris to birds are well studied. A review by K\u00fchn and van Franeker(link is external) found that over 40% of seabird species studied have ingested plastic. Albatrosses, fulmars, and shearwaters are among the seabird species that may be most affected by marine debris as it can get stuck entering their gizzard or in their gizzard, a section of the stomach that grinds food, and cannot easily pass through the digestive system. Laysan albatross chicks that ingested large amounts of plastic have been found to have lower weights, as the plastic in their stomach keeps them from eating a full meal. Adults not only build nests using collected debris, but pass any ingested debris on to their offspring when the chicks are fed.\nMarine Mammals: Many species of marine mammals have also been confirmed to eat marine debris. A review by K\u00fchn and van Franeker(link is external) found that 69 species of marine mammals have been found to ingest debris - that\u2019s 56% of all marine mammals! This includes 44 species of odontocetes (toothed whales), manatees, and multiple seal species. Marine mammals are highly protected, which can make it difficult to research them. Most research on marine mammals takes place after an animal dies, making it difficult to understand what marine debris live animals eat. However, we do know that because baleen whales filter extremely large amounts of water while feeding, they may get plastic debris entangled in their baleen plates.\nPlastics that are transported by surface currents will collect more debris in areas where currents meet, called convergence zones. In these areas, there are lots of nutrients, and the algae and phytoplankton at the base of the complex marine food web gather here. As areas with readily available food sources, they attract marine life across the food web, from tiny zooplankton to large marine mammals. Larger amounts of marine debris also collect in these areas where animals are most likely to look for food and feed, increasing the likelihood that they may accidentally eat plastics and marine debris.\nAlthough some animals may be more likely to eat plas\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The release of microplastics from landfill leachate into the environment can have undesirable effects on humans and biota. This study provides the state of the science regarding the source, detection, occurrence, and remediation of microplastics in landfill leachate based on a comprehensive review of the scientific literature, mostly in the recent decade. Solid waste and wastewater treatment residue are the primary sources of microplastics in landfill leachate. Microplastic concentration in raw and treated landfill leachate varied between 0\u2013382 and 0\u20132.7 items L\u22121. Microplastics in raw landfill leachate are largely attributable to local plastic waste production and solid waste management practices. Polyethylene, polystyrene, and polypropylene are the most prevalent microplastic polymers in landfill leachate. Even though the colors of microplastics are primarily determined by their parent plastic waste, the predominance of light-colored microplastics in landfill leachate indicates long-term degradation. The identified morphologies of microplastics in leachate from all published sources contain fiber and fragments the most. Depending on the treatment method, leachate treatment processes can achieve microplastic removal rates between 3% and 100%. The review also provides unique perspectives on microplastics in landfill leachate in terms of remediation, final disposal, fate and transport among engineering systems, and source reduction, etc. The landfill\u2013wastewater treatment plant loop and bioreactor landfills present unique difficulties and opportunities for managing microplastics induced by landfill leachate.\nKeywords: Landfill leachate, Microplastics, Source, Detection, Occurrence, Treatment\nSecondary microplastic can be produced in landfills and end up in leachate.\nMicroplastic concentrations in landfill leachate are less than in sewage.\nPolyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene dominate leachate microplastics.\nMost microplastic removal is driven by separation.\nBiodegradation is aided by landfill-wastewater treatment plant leachate cycling.\nOver 335 million tons of plastic are produced annually globally, making it an indispensable component of modern life [1]. Plastics will be widely used despite initiatives to reduce their usage due to their portability, durability, and low cost. COVID-19 has boosted the usage of plastic in personal protective equipment (PPE), such as facemasks and gloves [[2], [3], [4]]. Plastic garbage enters aquatic and terrestrial areas, threatening ecosystems and possibly endangering biota and humans [5,6]. In the environment, plastics degrade with time through physical, chemical, and biological processes (i.e., hydrolysis, photodegradation, thermal oxidation, mechanical abrasion, and biodegradation) [7]. As plastics deteriorate, their size reduces, and microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) are generated, making the problem less evident but more harmful.\nPlastics <5 mm are defined as microplastics, and nanoplastics are plastics with particle sizes ranging in sub-micron scale. Nevertheless, the precise scientific definition of NPs is still under discussion, with the size being described as either 100 or 1000 nm in one dimension. The first detection of MPs was made in oceans [8]. An estimated 5 trillion MP particles are weighing 243,000 tons floating in the water due to MP degradation and deposition, posing a lethal threat to marine life [9]. Several investigations have also identified NPs in the marine environment [10]. In addition to the ocean, the abundance of MPs has been identified in every other environmental media, including wastewater, drinking water, surface water, and landfill [1,9,11,12].\nThe toxic effects of MPs are well documented in the environment [6,13,14]. Due to the increasing concerns about the global impacts of MPs, many studies are going on, and documents are available on the occurrence and treatment of MPs in different environmental systems. Landfills receive a large number of MPs from several primary and secondary sources. Many other pollutants are also present in landfills that can be adsorbed by the MPs. MPs from landfill might infiltrate leachate via rainwater. If not properly engineered, MPs may percolate to groundwater or other terrestrial locations. Landfills have also been identified as a source of MPs input to the marine environment [15]. However, landfill as a contamination source and hotspot of MPs is less explored than other aquatic environments, as current research mostly focused on the fields of water (ocean, surface, and groundwater) and wastewater [[16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]]. This study critically reviewed some available scientific literature on MPs in landfill leachate and provides state-of-the-science regarding the source, occurrence, and remediation of MPs in landfill leachate.\nThe two principal sources of MPs in landfill leachate are solid waste and wastewater treatment plant residual, e.g., sludge and fat, oil, and grease (FOG), etc. [22]. Plastic waste dumped in landfills can go through several abrasive activities and produce secondary microplastics. MPs can also enter into landfill from numerous primary sources. Wastewater is also a significant collection point for MPs [20]. MPs can get entrapped in FOG and solid sludge during the treatment process. Upon disposal in landfills, sludge and FOG from sewage can augment the abundance of MPs in landfill leachate [23]. Fig. 1 demonstrates the sources of microplastics in the landfill leachate microplastics from solid waste.\nSource and environmental pathways of microplastics via landfill leachate.\nAt the end-of-life of plastic products, the best possible and most desired approach is recycling.

Some microplastics, known as primary microplastics, are \u201cmicro\u201d by design: Microbeads, for example, are tiny plastic spheres manufacturers add to body washes, toothpastes and other products to give them extra scrubbing power. Lentil-sized pellets known as nurdles, which are used in the manufacture of many common plastic products, are also intentionally small.\nSecondary microplastics are fragmented particles of plastic resulting from the \u201cweathering\u201d of larger pieces of plastic debris, such as water bottles, straws, cups, and car fenders from exposure to sunlight, temperature, and humidity over time. Ocean waves can also degrade larger plastics by repeatedly washing over them and grinding them into the sand.\nScientists believe microplastics are present in oceans around the world, but unlike larger plastics which can be seen unaided, microplastics are harder to find. Ocean currents and circulation patterns move microplastics around like confetti, making them difficult to track. Scientists have only recently begun looking for microplastic \u201chot spots\u201d in the ocean by determining where larger plastics enter the water and creating computer models to predict where the broken-down fragments end up.\nA 2015 study estimated that roughly eight million tons of plastics enter the world\u2019s oceans each year, yet only one percent is found floating at the surface in visible form. This suggests that the bulk of plastics in the ocean are likely microplastics suspended in the water or buried in sediments\u2014yet scientists are only beginning to understand where they might be, not to mention their potential impacts on ocean life, ecosystems, and human health.\nMany people have seen photos that demonstrate the impacts larger plastics can have on marine life, whether it\u2019s a sea turtle snarled in a plastic six-pack ring or a dolphin entangled in plastic fishing gear. While the impacts of larger plastics are well understood, far less is known about the health impacts associated with microplastics.\nMarine organisms at the base of the food chain including plankton and fish larvae are known to consume microplastics, and filter-feeding animals which humans eat, such as oysters and scallops, ingest the particles as they filter seawater.\nPlastics could present a risk to both marine animals and humans since they may contain toxic chemicals like phthalates, bisphenol A and others used in the manufacturing process. These additives can change the properties of plastic items in different ways. For example, they may make water bottles more rigid, and pens more flexible. Plastics can also become toxic by soaking up harmful chemicals from the environment such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), exposure to which has been directly linked to cancer and other serious human health problems.\nScientists are studying the potential health risks of microplastics to marine life and humans by determining which types appear to be the most toxic and how much of those are being ingested by marine animals.\nWOODS HOLE OCEANOGRAPHIC INSTITUTION\nAreas of Research Departments, Centers & Labs Programs & Projects Ships & Technology Data & Repositories MBLWHOI Library\nGraduate Postdoctoral Undergraduate Guest Students K-12 Resources Accreditation\nWoods Hole Oceanographic Institution is a 501 (c)(3) organization.

Plastics typically have high molecular weight, meaning each molecule can have thousands of atoms bound together. Naturally occurring materials, such as wood, horn and rosin, are also composed of molecules of high molecular weight. The manufactured or synthetic plastics are often designed to mimic the properties of natural materials. Plastics, also called polymers, are produced by the conversion of natural products or by the synthesis from primary chemicals generally coming from oil, natural gas, or coal.\n\u201cMost plastics are based on the carbon atom. Silicones, which are based on the silicon atom, are an exception. The carbon atom can link to other atoms with up to four chemical bonds. When all of the bonds are to other carbon atoms, diamonds or graphite or carbon black soot may result. For plastics the carbon atoms are also connected to the aforementioned hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, chlorine, or sulfur. When the connections of atoms result in long chains, like pearls on a string of pearls, the polymer is called a thermoplastic. Thermoplastics are characterized by being meltable. The thermoplastics all have repeat units, the smallest section of the chain that is identical. We call these repeat units unit cells. The vast majority of plastics, about 92%, are thermoplastics1.\n\u201cThe groups of atoms that are used to make unit cells are called monomers. For some plastics, such as polyethylene, the repeat unit can be just one carbon atom and two hydrogen atoms. For other plastics, such as nylons, the repeat unit can involve 38 or more atoms. When we combine monomers, we generate polymers or plastics. Raw materials form monomers that can be or are used to form unit cells. Monomers are used form polymers or plastics\n\u201cWhen the connection of the carbon atoms forms two and three-dimensional networks instead of one-dimension chains, the polymer will be a thermoset plastic. Thermoset plastics are characterized by not being meltable. Thermoset plastics, such as epoxy adhesives or unsaturated polyester boat hulls and bathtubs or the phenolic adhesives used to make plywood, are created by the user mixing two chemicals and immediately using the mixture before the plastic \u201csets up\u201d or cures.\n\u201cThe formation of the repeat units for thermoplastics usually begins with the formation of small carbon-based molecules that can be combined to form monomers. The monomers, in turn, are joined together by chemical polymerization mechanisms to form polymers. The raw material formation may begin by separating the hydrocarbon chemicals from natural gas, petroleum, or coal into pure streams of chemicals. Some are then processed in a \u201ccracking process.\u201d Here, in the presence of a catalyst, raw materials molecules are converted into monomers such as ethylene (ethene) C2H4, propylene (propene) C3H6, and butene C4H8 and others. All of these monomers contain double bonds between carbon atoms such that the carbon atoms can subsequently react to form polymers.\n\u201cOther raw material chemicals are isolated from petroleum, such as benzene and xylenes. These chemicals are reacted with others to form the monomers for polystyrene, nylons, and polyesters. The raw materials have been changed into monomers and no longer contain the petroleum fractions. Still other raw materials can be obtained from renewable resources, such as cellulose from wood to make cellulose butyrate. For the polymerization step to work efficiently, the monomers must be very pure. All manufacturers purify raw materials and monomers, capturing unused raw materials for reuse and byproducts for proper disposition.\n\u201cMonomers are then chemically bonded into chains called polymers.There are two basic mechanisms for polymerization: addition reactions and condensation reactions. For addition reactions a special catalyst is added, frequently a peroxide, that causes one monomer to link to the next and that to the next and so on. Catalysts do not cause reactions to occur, but cause the reactions to happen more rapidly. Addition polymerization, used for polyethylene and polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride among others, creates no byproducts. The reactions can be done in the gaseous phase dispersed in liquids. The second polymerization mechanism, condensation polymerization, uses catalysts to have all monomers react with any adjacent monomer. The reaction results in two monomers forming dimers (two unit cells) plus a byproduct. Dimers can combine to form tetramers (four unit cells) and so on. For condensation polymerization the byproducts must be removed for the chemical reaction to produce useful products. Some byproducts are water, which is treated and disposed. Other byproducts are raw materials and recycled for reuse within the process. The removal of byproducts is conducted so that valuable recycled raw materials are not lost to the environment or exposed to populations. Condensation reactions are typically done in a mass of molten polymer. Polyesters and nylons are made by condensation polymerization.\n\u201cDifferent combinations of monomers can yield plastic resins with different properties and characteristics. When all monomers are the same, the polymer is called a homopolymer. When more than one monomer is used, the polymer is called a copolymer. Plastic milk jugs are an example of homopolymer HDPE. Milk is satisfactorily packaged in the less expensive homopolymer HDPE. Laundry detergent bottles are an example of copolymer HDPE. The aggressive nature of the detergent makes a copolymer the right choice for best service function. Each monomer yields a plastic resin with specific properties and characteristics.

Social Impact of Landfills.\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nDue to the accumulation of an enormous amount of plastic waste from municipal and industrial sources in landfills, landfill leachate is becoming a significant reservoir of microplastics. The release of microplastics from landfill leachate into the environment can have undesirable effects on humans and biota. This study provides the state of the science regarding the source, detection, occurrence, and remediation of microplastics in landfill leachate based on a comprehensive review of the scientific literature, mostly in the recent decade. Solid waste and wastewater treatment residue are the primary sources of microplastics in landfill leachate. Microplastic concentration in raw and treated landfill leachate varied between 0\u2013382 and 0\u20132.7 items L\u22121.

The release of microplastics from landfill leachate into the environment can have undesirable effects on humans and biota. This study provides the state of the science regarding the source, detection, occurrence, and remediation of microplastics in landfill leachate based on a comprehensive review of the scientific literature, mostly in the recent decade. Solid waste and wastewater treatment residue are the primary sources of microplastics in landfill leachate. Microplastic concentration in raw and treated landfill leachate varied between 0\u2013382 and 0\u20132.7 items L\u22121. Microplastics in raw landfill leachate are largely attributable to local plastic waste production and solid waste management practices. Polyethylene, polystyrene, and polypropylene are the most prevalent microplastic polymers in landfill leachate. Even though the colors of microplastics are primarily determined by their parent plastic waste, the predominance of light-colored microplastics in landfill leachate indicates long-term degradation. The identified morphologies of microplastics in leachate from all published sources contain fiber and fragments the most. Depending on the treatment method, leachate treatment processes can achieve microplastic removal rates between 3% and 100%. The review also provides unique perspectives on microplastics in landfill leachate in terms of remediation, final disposal, fate and transport among engineering systems, and source reduction, etc. The landfill\u2013wastewater treatment plant loop and bioreactor landfills present unique difficulties and opportunities for managing microplastics induced by landfill leachate.\nKeywords: Landfill leachate, Microplastics, Source, Detection, Occurrence, Treatment\nSecondary microplastic can be produced in landfills and end up in leachate.\nMicroplastic concentrations in landfill leachate are less than in sewage.\nPolyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene dominate leachate microplastics.\nMost microplastic removal is driven by separation.\nBiodegradation is aided by landfill-wastewater treatment plant leachate cycling.\nOver 335 million tons of plastic are produced annually globally, making it an indispensable component of modern life [1]. Plastics will be widely used despite initiatives to reduce their usage due to their portability, durability, and low cost. COVID-19 has boosted the usage of plastic in personal protective equipment (PPE), such as facemasks and gloves [[2], [3], [4]]. Plastic garbage enters aquatic and terrestrial areas, threatening ecosystems and possibly endangering biota and humans [5,6]. In the environment, plastics degrade with time through physical, chemical, and biological processes (i.e., hydrolysis, photodegradation, thermal oxidation, mechanical abrasion, and biodegradation) [7]. As plastics deteriorate, their size reduces, and microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) are generated, making the problem less evident but more harmful.\nPlastics <5 mm are defined as microplastics, and nanoplastics are plastics with particle sizes ranging in sub-micron scale. Nevertheless, the precise scientific definition of NPs is still under discussion, with the size being described as either 100 or 1000 nm in one dimension. The first detection of MPs was made in oceans [8]. An estimated 5 trillion MP particles are weighing 243,000 tons floating in the water due to MP degradation and deposition, posing a lethal threat to marine life [9]. Several investigations have also identified NPs in the marine environment [10]. In addition to the ocean, the abundance of MPs has been identified in every other environmental media, including wastewater, drinking water, surface water, and landfill [1,9,11,12].\nThe toxic effects of MPs are well documented in the environment [6,13,14]. Due to the increasing concerns about the global impacts of MPs, many studies are going on, and documents are available on the occurrence and treatment of MPs in different environmental systems. Landfills receive a large number of MPs from several primary and secondary sources. Many other pollutants are also present in landfills that can be adsorbed by the MPs. MPs from landfill might infiltrate leachate via rainwater. If not properly engineered, MPs may percolate to groundwater or other terrestrial locations. Landfills have also been identified as a source of MPs input to the marine environment [15]. However, landfill as a contamination source and hotspot of MPs is less explored than other aquatic environments, as current research mostly focused on the fields of water (ocean, surface, and groundwater) and wastewater [[16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]]. This study critically reviewed some available scientific literature on MPs in landfill leachate and provides state-of-the-science regarding the source, occurrence, and remediation of MPs in landfill leachate.\nThe two principal sources of MPs in landfill leachate are solid waste and wastewater treatment plant residual, e.g., sludge and fat, oil, and grease (FOG), etc. [22]. Plastic waste dumped in landfills can go through several abrasive activities and produce secondary microplastics. MPs can also enter into landfill from numerous primary sources. Wastewater is also a significant collection point for MPs [20]. MPs can get entrapped in FOG and solid sludge during the treatment process. Upon disposal in landfills, sludge and FOG from sewage can augment the abundance of MPs in landfill leachate [23]. Fig. 1 demonstrates the sources of microplastics in the landfill leachate microplastics from solid waste.\nSource and environmental pathways of microplastics via landfill leachate.\nAt the end-of-life of plastic products, the best possible and most desired approach is recycling.

Some microplastics, known as primary microplastics, are \u201cmicro\u201d by design: Microbeads, for example, are tiny plastic spheres manufacturers add to body washes, toothpastes and other products to give them extra scrubbing power. Lentil-sized pellets known as nurdles, which are used in the manufacture of many common plastic products, are also intentionally small.\nSecondary microplastics are fragmented particles of plastic resulting from the \u201cweathering\u201d of larger pieces of plastic debris, such as water bottles, straws, cups, and car fenders from exposure to sunlight, temperature, and humidity over time. Ocean waves can also degrade larger plastics by repeatedly washing over them and grinding them into the sand.\nScientists believe microplastics are present in oceans around the world, but unlike larger plastics which can be seen unaided, microplastics are harder to find. Ocean currents and circulation patterns move microplastics around like confetti, making them difficult to track. Scientists have only recently begun looking for microplastic \u201chot spots\u201d in the ocean by determining where larger plastics enter the water and creating computer models to predict where the broken-down fragments end up.\nA 2015 study estimated that roughly eight million tons of plastics enter the world\u2019s oceans each year, yet only one percent is found floating at the surface in visible form. This suggests that the bulk of plastics in the ocean are likely microplastics suspended in the water or buried in sediments\u2014yet scientists are only beginning to understand where they might be, not to mention their potential impacts on ocean life, ecosystems, and human health.\nMany people have seen photos that demonstrate the impacts larger plastics can have on marine life, whether it\u2019s a sea turtle snarled in a plastic six-pack ring or a dolphin entangled in plastic fishing gear. While the impacts of larger plastics are well understood, far less is known about the health impacts associated with microplastics.\nMarine organisms at the base of the food chain including plankton and fish larvae are known to consume microplastics, and filter-feeding animals which humans eat, such as oysters and scallops, ingest the particles as they filter seawater.\nPlastics could present a risk to both marine animals and humans since they may contain toxic chemicals like phthalates, bisphenol A and others used in the manufacturing process. These additives can change the properties of plastic items in different ways. For example, they may make water bottles more rigid, and pens more flexible. Plastics can also become toxic by soaking up harmful chemicals from the environment such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), exposure to which has been directly linked to cancer and other serious human health problems.\nScientists are studying the potential health risks of microplastics to marine life and humans by determining which types appear to be the most toxic and how much of those are being ingested by marine animals.\nWOODS HOLE OCEANOGRAPHIC INSTITUTION\nAreas of Research Departments, Centers & Labs Programs & Projects Ships & Technology Data & Repositories MBLWHOI Library\nGraduate Postdoctoral Undergraduate Guest Students K-12 Resources Accreditation\nWoods Hole Oceanographic Institution is a 501 (c)(3) organization.

Here's how you know we're official.\nAnimals have been eating, or ingesting, plastic and other marine debris for a long time. The ingestion of plastic by wildlife was first observed in 1966, when researchers found plastic container lids and toys in dead Laysan albatross chicks. These observations happened more than 20 years before the Great Pacific Garbage Patch was discovered. A review by Kuhn and van Franeker(link is external) found that over 700 species, including seabirds, fish, turtles, and marine mammals, have been confirmed to eat plastic. That number will likely increase over time as wildlife continues to encounter our trash.\nDebris items may be mistaken for food and ingested, or may be accidentally ingested when mixed with or attached to an animal's natural food. Because many plastics float, break into small, easily eaten pieces, and are colorful, they are more likely to attract hungry animals than other types of marine debris. Eating plastic may lead to loss of nutrition, internal injury, intestinal blockage, starvation, and even death. We know that ingested plastic is harmful to animals, and research is still being conducted to figure out all the effects, especially to communities and wild populations.\nPlankton, shellfish, birds, fish, marine mammals, and sea turtles from all parts of the globe and from various depths of the ocean have been confirmed to ingest plastic debris. The amount and type of plastic they eat often relates directly to the animal\u2019s feeding behavior. Passive feeders, or animals that filter their food from water or soil, may unintentionally eat microplastics with their food. Animals that are active feeders, that search for and capture their food, ingest plastic not only accidentally while feeding, but also any debris inside of their prey.\nSome animals are able to release debris without passing it fully into the digestive system, such as birds that can regurgitate, or throw up indigestible materials. Debris can also pass completely through the digestive system for many animals depending on its shape and size. If an animal is not able to regurgitate or pass marine debris through their system, it can cause serious health problems. Sharp or rough plastic marine debris can create cuts in the digestive system, leading to infection and internal bleeding. It can also block their digestive system, making them feel full, reducing their urge to eat, and making it difficult for the animal to get the nutrients they need.\nPlastic can also carry harmful pollutants. They may absorb pollutants that are in the water around them, or release chemicals that are added to plastics during production to make them colorful or flexible. These chemicals may enter the body of an animal if ingested. Whether an animal eats the plastic itself, or eats an animal that has already eaten plastic, there could be possible health impacts on marine wildlife. Although wildlife may be exposed to these contaminants from plastics, more research is needed to understand how they might be affected, depending on the size of the plastics and how long they stay in an animal.\nSea Turtles: All seven species of sea turtles have been confirmed to eat marine debris. Sea turtles most commonly try to eat plastic sheeting and plastic bags, which may resemble their jellyfish prey. This type of debris can get stuck in their digestive system, making them feel full. Since they no longer feel hungry, they lose the urge to feed which can lead to poor nutrition and starvation. A review by K\u00fchn and van Franeker(link is external) estimated that 32% of turtles have plastic marine debris in their stomachs. Learn more about how ingesting marine debris affects turtles with the University of North Carolina Wilmington\u2019s MarineQuest Turtle Trash Collectors Interactive Video.\nBirds: The impacts of marine debris to birds are well studied. A review by K\u00fchn and van Franeker(link is external) found that over 40% of seabird species studied have ingested plastic. Albatrosses, fulmars, and shearwaters are among the seabird species that may be most affected by marine debris as it can get stuck entering their gizzard or in their gizzard, a section of the stomach that grinds food, and cannot easily pass through the digestive system. Laysan albatross chicks that ingested large amounts of plastic have been found to have lower weights, as the plastic in their stomach keeps them from eating a full meal. Adults not only build nests using collected debris, but pass any ingested debris on to their offspring when the chicks are fed.\nMarine Mammals: Many species of marine mammals have also been confirmed to eat marine debris. A review by K\u00fchn and van Franeker(link is external) found that 69 species of marine mammals have been found to ingest debris - that\u2019s 56% of all marine mammals! This includes 44 species of odontocetes (toothed whales), manatees, and multiple seal species. Marine mammals are highly protected, which can make it difficult to research them. Most research on marine mammals takes place after an animal dies, making it difficult to understand what marine debris live animals eat. However, we do know that because baleen whales filter extremely large amounts of water while feeding, they may get plastic debris entangled in their baleen plates.\nPlastics that are transported by surface currents will collect more debris in areas where currents meet, called convergence zones. In these areas, there are lots of nutrients, and the algae and phytoplankton at the base of the complex marine food web gather here. As areas with readily available food sources, they attract marine life across the food web, from tiny zooplankton to large marine mammals. Larger amounts of marine debris also collect in these areas where animals are most likely to look for food and feed, increasing the likelihood that they may accidentally eat plastics and marine debris.\nAlthough some animals may be more likely to eat plas\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

These small plastic bits are called \"microplastics.\" Other plastics are ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nMicroplastics are changing the oceans, with millions of metric tons of plastic shedding trillions of pieces of plastic into our seas. They are harder to see than seabirds with stomachs full of plastic or sea turtles entangled in abandoned fishing nets, but just as concerning. Microplastics have infiltrated the entire marine ecosystem, from the sea surface to the seafloor, and these plastic particles are harming wildlife and disrupting critical ecological processes that regulate ocean health\u2014and, in turn, the health of our planet.\nIn the oceans, sunlight, wind, waves, and other forms of weathering rapidly break plastic items up into microplastics and even smaller nanoplastics. Roughly 170 trillion plastic particles, weighing 2.3 million metric tons, now circulate the ocean\u2019s surface waters alone. Scientists estimate an additional 11 million metric tons of plastic has been deposited on the seafloor, shedding an unknown amount of microplastic that mixes with ocean waters and sediments. An unknown amount of plastic and plastic particles permeate the middle ocean layers.\nScientists are just beginning to uncover the full extent of the damage caused by plastic pollution in the oceans, but it is already known to be harmful. Microplastics have been found to cause serious health problems and their consumption is linked to mortality in corals, fish, marine mammals, seabirds, sea turtles, zooplankton, and other ocean creatures. More broadly, microplastics are interfering with the ocean\u2019s biogeochemistry\u2014the web of biological, chemical, and geological interactions that drive vital Earth cycles, sustain marine ecosystems, and regulate the climate. These disruptions carry serious implications not only for marine life, but also for humans, as all life on Earth depends upon a healthy ocean.\nMicroplastics travel through the entire water column, forming a \u201clight smog\u201d or \u201csoup\u201d just below the surface. Some plastics like polypropylene\u2014commonly used in takeout containers\u2014are buoyant and tend to float closer to the surface, while denser plastics such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET or PETE), often the material for water bottles, are more likely to sink lower toward the seafloor. Weathering and colonization by algaes, bacteria, and other microorganisms can also influence whether plastic particles are more likely to float or sink.\nPlastic particles accumulate in some of the highest concentrations within ocean gyres\u2014large rotating systems of water currents driven by Earth\u2019s rotations, differences in salinity, temperature, tides, and winds. Gyres help drive the \u201cocean conveyor belt,\u201d which feeds other currents that circulate ocean water around the planet, and are critical to the ocean\u2019s regulation of nutrient flows, temperature and salinity.\nPlastics have also been found at unprecedented depths, including in the deepest part of the ocean, nearly seven miles down, in the Mariana Trench. Scientists have found that turbidity currents (underwater \u201cavalanches\u201d of sediments) are at least partly responsible for transporting large volumes of microplastics down underwater canyons into the deep sea. Along the way, these currents can also pick up and carry harmful chemical pollutants linked to plastics, like heavy metals, PCBs, and PFAS. While turbidity currents play an essential role in moving oxygen and nutrients to deep-sea ecosystems\u2014some of the most biodiverse and least understood on the planet\u2014they are also inadvertently delivering waves of plastic pollution.\nThe deep sea, Earth\u2019s largest habitat, supports biological and chemical processes critical for Earth\u2019s self-regulating functions, including oceanic heat absorption, release of nutrients from sediments, and long-term carbon cycling and storage.

It lies a few hundred miles north of Hawaii. It\u2019s an area where large amounts of floating plastics have accumulated as a result of ocean currents.\nThe composition of the plastics in the GPGP are quite different from the rest of the ocean. Most of the plastic that enters the ocean comes from land-based sources \u2013 it comes from rivers or is swept towards coastlines.\nOf the plastic entering the ocean, only small amounts are carried far offshore; most plastic either sinks to the seabed, or stays close to the shoreline.\nThe accumulation of plastics in the middle of the ocean can be quite different. We know this from taking large samples of the plastics in the GPGP. Laurent Lebreton and his colleagues have been doing large-scale surveys for years.\nIn a 2018 paper they found that, by mass, around 46% of the plastics were fishing nets and ropes. This was around 60% for plastics larger than 5 centimeters1\nIn 2022 they published another study, this time looking at the composition of hard plastics \u2013 large plastics that were larger than 5 centimeters but excluding nets or ropes.2 They retrieved over 6000 pieces of hard plastic, with the identified sources shown in the chart below.\nThe breakdowns are shown in terms of the number of pieces found, and the mass of debris found.\nAround one-third of the plastics were small fragments that couldn\u2019t be identified.\nYou can see that in terms of mass, a significant fraction of plastic comes from aquaculture and fishing materials. Add floats and buoys and crates to this, and these industries contributed around 40% of the hard plastics by mass.\nCombine this with nets and ropes, and the researchers conclude that between 75% and 86% of floating plastics larger than 5 centimeters could be from abandoned, lost or discarded fishing gear.\nResearchers could use language markings to estimate where this plastic came from. Most originated in just a handful of countries: Japan and China both contributed one-third each, 15% from South Korea; 5% from the United States; and 3% from Taiwan. The rest was split among other countries.\nOne of the reasons that Japan is thought to contribute so highly was that the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami washed large amounts of debris offshore. Nonetheless, this research suggests that only a small number of industrialized fishing nations contribute most of the plastic in the GPGP.\nLebreton, L., Slat, B., Ferrari, F., Sainte-Rose, B., Aitken, J., Marthouse, R., ... & Reisser, J.

Dead seabirds are often found with stomachs that are full of plastic waste.\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government. Here's how you know we're official.\nAnimals have been eating, or ingesting, plastic and other marine debris for a long time. The ingestion of plastic by wildlife was first observed in 1966, when researchers found plastic container lids and toys in dead Laysan albatross chicks. These observations happened more than 20 years before the Great Pacific Garbage Patch was discovered. A review by Kuhn and van Franeker(link is external) found that over 700 species, including seabirds, fish, turtles, and marine mammals, have been confirmed to eat plastic. That number will likely increase over time as wildlife continues to encounter our trash.\nDebris items may be mistaken for food and ingested, or may be accidentally ingested when mixed with or attached to an animal's natural food. Because many plastics float, break into small, easily eaten pieces, and are colorful, they are more likely to attract hungry animals than other types of marine debris. Eating plastic may lead to loss of nutrition, internal injury, intestinal blockage, starvation, and even death. We know that ingested plastic is harmful to animals, and research is still being conducted to figure out all the effects, especially to communities and wild populations.\nPlankton, shellfish, birds, fish, marine mammals, and sea turtles from all parts of the globe and from various depths of the ocean have been confirmed to ingest plastic debris. The amount and type of plastic they eat often relates directly to the animal\u2019s feeding behavior. Passive feeders, or animals that filter their food from water or soil, may unintentionally eat microplastics with their food. Animals that are active feeders, that search for and capture their food, ingest plastic not only accidentally while feeding, but also any debris inside of their prey.\nSome animals are able to release debris without passing it fully into the digestive system, such as birds that can regurgitate, or throw up indigestible materials. Debris can also pass completely through the digestive system for many animals depending on its shape and size. If an animal is not able to regurgitate or pass marine debris through their system, it can cause serious health problems. Sharp or rough plastic marine debris can create cuts in the digestive system, leading to infection and internal bleeding. It can also block their digestive system, making them feel full, reducing their urge to eat, and making it difficult for the animal to get the nutrients they need.\nPlastic can also carry harmful pollutants. They may absorb pollutants that are in the water around them, or release chemicals that are added to plastics during production to make them colorful or flexible. These chemicals may enter the body of an animal if ingested. Whether an animal eats the plastic itself, or eats an animal that has already eaten plastic, there could be possible health impacts on marine wildlife. Although wildlife may be exposed to these contaminants from plastics, more research is needed to understand how they might be affected, depending on the size of the plastics and how long they stay in an animal.\nSea Turtles: All seven species of sea turtles have been confirmed to eat marine debris. Sea turtles most commonly try to eat plastic sheeting and plastic bags, which may resemble their jellyfish prey. This type of debris can get stuck in their digestive system, making them feel full. Since they no longer feel hungry, they lose the urge to feed which can lead to poor nutrition and starvation. A review by K\u00fchn and van Franeker(link is external) estimated that 32% of turtles have plastic marine debris in their stomachs. Learn more about how ingesting marine debris affects turtles with the University of North Carolina Wilmington\u2019s MarineQuest Turtle Trash Collectors Interactive Video.\nBirds: The impacts of marine debris to birds are well studied. A review by K\u00fchn and van Franeker(link is external) found that over 40% of seabird species studied have ingested plastic. Albatrosses, fulmars, and shearwaters are among the seabird species that may be most affected by marine debris as it can get stuck entering their gizzard or in their gizzard, a section of the stomach that grinds food, and cannot easily pass through the digestive system. Laysan albatross chicks that ingested large amounts of plastic have been found to have lower weights, as the plastic in their stomach keeps them from eating a full meal. Adults not only build nests using collected debris, but pass any ingested debris on to their offspring when the chicks are fed.\nMarine Mammals: Many species of marine mammals have also been confirmed to eat marine debris. A review by K\u00fchn and van Franeker(link is external) found that 69 species of marine mammals have been found to ingest debris - that\u2019s 56% of all marine mammals! This includes 44 species of odontocetes (toothed whales), manatees, and multiple seal species. Marine mammals are highly protected, which can make it difficult to research them. Most research on marine mammals takes place after an animal dies, making it difficult to understand what marine debris live animals eat. However, we do know that because baleen whales filter extremely large amounts of water while feeding, they may get plastic debris entangled in their baleen plates.\nPlastics that are transported by surface currents will collect more debris in areas where currents meet, called convergence zones. In these areas, there are lots of nutrients, and the algae and phytoplankton at the base of the complex marine food web gather here. As areas with readily available food sources, they attract marine life across the food web, from tiny zooplankton to large marine mammals. Larger amounts of marine debris also collect in these areas where animals are most likely to look for food and feed, increasing the likelihood that they may accidentally eat plastics and marine debris.\nAlthough some animals may be more likely to eat plas\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Researchers have found that exposure to microplastics is impairing prochlorococcus\u2019 photosynthetic efficiency, potentially undermining one of the ocean\u2019s vital processes for removing CO2 from the atmosphere and sustaining our planet\u2019s oxygen levels.\nEven more concerning are the implications for the biological carbon pump\u2014the process by which carbon is sequestered in the deep ocean for hundreds to thousands of years. When zooplankton ingest microplastics, their feces are made more buoyant, and this prematurely releases carbon higher in the water column instead of transporting it to the seafloor, where it would naturally fall.

This plastic debris gradually breaks down into smaller ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nMicroplastics are changing the oceans, with millions of metric tons of plastic shedding trillions of pieces of plastic into our seas. They are harder to see than seabirds with stomachs full of plastic or sea turtles entangled in abandoned fishing nets, but just as concerning. Microplastics have infiltrated the entire marine ecosystem, from the sea surface to the seafloor, and these plastic particles are harming wildlife and disrupting critical ecological processes that regulate ocean health\u2014and, in turn, the health of our planet.\nIn the oceans, sunlight, wind, waves, and other forms of weathering rapidly break plastic items up into microplastics and even smaller nanoplastics. Roughly 170 trillion plastic particles, weighing 2.3 million metric tons, now circulate the ocean\u2019s surface waters alone. Scientists estimate an additional 11 million metric tons of plastic has been deposited on the seafloor, shedding an unknown amount of microplastic that mixes with ocean waters and sediments. An unknown amount of plastic and plastic particles permeate the middle ocean layers.\nScientists are just beginning to uncover the full extent of the damage caused by plastic pollution in the oceans, but it is already known to be harmful. Microplastics have been found to cause serious health problems and their consumption is linked to mortality in corals, fish, marine mammals, seabirds, sea turtles, zooplankton, and other ocean creatures. More broadly, microplastics are interfering with the ocean\u2019s biogeochemistry\u2014the web of biological, chemical, and geological interactions that drive vital Earth cycles, sustain marine ecosystems, and regulate the climate. These disruptions carry serious implications not only for marine life, but also for humans, as all life on Earth depends upon a healthy ocean.\nMicroplastics travel through the entire water column, forming a \u201clight smog\u201d or \u201csoup\u201d just below the surface. Some plastics like polypropylene\u2014commonly used in takeout containers\u2014are buoyant and tend to float closer to the surface, while denser plastics such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET or PETE), often the material for water bottles, are more likely to sink lower toward the seafloor. Weathering and colonization by algaes, bacteria, and other microorganisms can also influence whether plastic particles are more likely to float or sink.\nPlastic particles accumulate in some of the highest concentrations within ocean gyres\u2014large rotating systems of water currents driven by Earth\u2019s rotations, differences in salinity, temperature, tides, and winds. Gyres help drive the \u201cocean conveyor belt,\u201d which feeds other currents that circulate ocean water around the planet, and are critical to the ocean\u2019s regulation of nutrient flows, temperature and salinity.\nPlastics have also been found at unprecedented depths, including in the deepest part of the ocean, nearly seven miles down, in the Mariana Trench. Scientists have found that turbidity currents (underwater \u201cavalanches\u201d of sediments) are at least partly responsible for transporting large volumes of microplastics down underwater canyons into the deep sea. Along the way, these currents can also pick up and carry harmful chemical pollutants linked to plastics, like heavy metals, PCBs, and PFAS. While turbidity currents play an essential role in moving oxygen and nutrients to deep-sea ecosystems\u2014some of the most biodiverse and least understood on the planet\u2014they are also inadvertently delivering waves of plastic pollution.\nThe deep sea, Earth\u2019s largest habitat, supports biological and chemical processes critical for Earth\u2019s self-regulating functions, including oceanic heat absorption, release of nutrients from sediments, and long-term carbon cycling and storage. But plastic items and particles accumulating in these remote regions pose a growing threat to the delicate balance of the ocean\u2019s regulatory systems, especially in the deep sea.\nThe ocean absorbs approximately 25% of human-generated carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, and so is effectively the Earth\u2019s largest carbon storage sink. The process of carbon sequestration in the oceans depends heavily on phytoplankton\u2014microscopic plant life that, like land plants, photosynthesize using sunlight to draw carbon from the air\u2014and zooplankton, tiny animals that feed on phytoplankton and help transfer that carbon to the deep sea through their feces, which rain down to the seafloor.\nThese creatures, naked to the human eye, do much to protect us from experiencing the full impacts of our own greenhouse gas emissions. But emerging research suggests that microplastics are disrupting this delicate balance. Microplastics and even smaller nanoplastics may impair phytoplankton\u2019s ability to photosynthesize, while chronic exposure is altering zooplankton behavior, reproduction, and even survival. These disruptions ripple through the food web and jeopardize the ocean\u2019s ability to regulate atmospheric carbon.\nOne type of phytoplankton, Prochlorococcus, is responsible for generating 20% of the oxygen we breathe through photosynthesis. One single drop of ocean water may contain up to 20,000 of them, making them some of the most plentiful creatures on Earth. Researchers have found that exposure to microplastics is impairing prochlorococcus\u2019 photosynthetic efficiency, potentially undermining one of the ocean\u2019s vital processes for removing CO2 from the atmosphere and sustaining our planet\u2019s oxygen levels.\nEven more concerning are the implications for the biological carbon pump\u2014the process by which carbon is sequestered in the deep ocean for hundreds to thousands of years. When zooplankton ingest microplastics, their feces are made more buoyant, and this prematurely releases carbon higher in the water column instead of transporting it to the seafloor, where it would naturally fall. This interference could short-circuit one of the planet\u2019s most effective climate-regulating mechanisms.

It\u2019s not a floating island of trash, like a garbage dump or a landfill. It\u2019s also not the only patch. They exist all throughout the ocean, and the Pacific Garbage Patch just happens to be the most famous.\nGarbage patches are large areas of marine debris concentration that are formed by rotating ocean currents called gyres - kind of like big whirlpools that suck things in. A garbage patch is made up of tiny plastic pieces called \u201cmicroplastics\u201d that are less than 5 millimeters long. It\u2019s more like pepper flakes swirling in a soup than something you can skim off the surface. You might come across some larger items, like plastic bottles, but it\u2019s possible to sail through a garbage patch and not see anything. And they\u2019re a big problem, for the ocean - and us.\nPeople often ask why we can\u2019t just scoop up all the marine debris in the ocean, and the answer is: unfortunately, it\u2019s just not that simple.\nThe first challenge is the sheer size of these garbage patches. They\u2019re huuuuuge! They\u2019re constantly moving with ocean currents. And there\u2019s debris from the ocean\u2019s surface all the way down to the sea floor. Not to mention all the marine life we would disrupt if we tried to just scoop up debris.\nSo what can we do? Well, the ultimate solution is prevention and we need to keep that as our highest priority. We can reduce, reuse, and recycle to keep trash out of the ocean in the first place. And we can participate in things like shoreline cleanups.

It\u2019s not a floating island of trash, like a garbage dump or a landfill. It\u2019s also not the only patch. They exist all throughout the ocean, and the Pacific Garbage Patch just happens to be the most famous.\nGarbage patches are large areas of marine debris concentration that are formed by rotating ocean currents called gyres - kind of like big whirlpools that suck things in. A garbage patch is made up of tiny plastic pieces called \u201cmicroplastics\u201d that are less than 5 millimeters long. It\u2019s more like pepper flakes swirling in a soup than something you can skim off the surface. You might come across some larger items, like plastic bottles, but it\u2019s possible to sail through a garbage patch and not see anything. And they\u2019re a big problem, for the ocean - and us.\nPeople often ask why we can\u2019t just scoop up all the marine debris in the ocean, and the answer is: unfortunately, it\u2019s just not that simple.\nThe first challenge is the sheer size of these garbage patches. They\u2019re huuuuuge! They\u2019re constantly moving with ocean currents. And there\u2019s debris from the ocean\u2019s surface all the way down to the sea floor. Not to mention all the marine life we would disrupt if we tried to just scoop up debris.\nSo what can we do? Well, the ultimate solution is prevention and we need to keep that as our highest priority. We can reduce, reuse, and recycle to keep trash out of the ocean in the first place. And we can participate in things like shoreline cleanups. It\u2019s a lot easier to deal with debris before we get to the ocean.\nNARRADOR:\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 es el Gran Parche de Basura del Pac\u00edfico?\nBueno primero, hablemos de lo que no es.

By using our websites, you consent to our use of cookies.\nVersatility, ease of manufacture, and relatively low cost make plastics some of the most useful materials for a wide range of applications. This article explains the chemistry and production processes behind two of the most popular plastics \u2014 polyethylene and polypropylene.\nPlastics are some of the world\u2019s most diverse and useful manufacturing materials. While plastics encompass a large number of materials, polyethylene and polypropylene are two of the major plastic types found in many consumer goods, from car parts to shopping bags to water pipes.\nSeveral types of reactors can make polymers, including fluidized-bed, loop, autoclave, and tubular reactors. Different grades of polyethylene and polypropylene offer a wide range of physical properties, such as density, stiffness, flexibility, opacity, melting point, texture, and strength. Manipulating variables in the reactor, such as monomer, comonomer, catalyst, and cooling media flowrates, can control key quality parameters. Additives and colorings can modify the appearance of the polymer.\nPolymer plants are semi-continuous processes. Raw material is fed into a reactor continuously at the front end, while polymer powder and pellets are packaged in batches. Most sites operate multiple lines with many bins and silos for storage and blending. The plastics are eventually delivered to customers using barges, trucks, or rail cars.\nThis article describes the different polyolefin production processes, their key operating parameters, and ways to use automation for improved quality control and higher throughput.\nIt\u2019s helpful to understand some of the chemistry behind the polymerization reaction to appreciate how the process works and the complexity involved in making plastic. A polymerization reaction starts with a primary ingredient (monomer), such as ethylene or propylene.\nEthylene (C2H4) is a stable molecule with two carbon atoms and a double bond. Polyethylene (PE) is a made by the reaction of multiple ethylene molecules in the presence of catalyst to break the double bond and connect the carbon atoms into a chain (Figure 1). The longer the chain, the higher the molecular weight. Polymers can have molecular weights in the millions.\nSimilarly, polypropylene (PP) is made by breaking the double bond in a propylene (C3H6) molecule, in the presence of a catalyst, to form long chains of three-carbon-atom molecules (Figure 2). The third carbon atom adds a complexity: On which side of the chain will the methyl (CH3) groups fall? They could all be on one side of the chain\u2019s centerline, or backbone (isotactic), they could appear alternately on opposite sides of the backbone (syndiotactic), or their positions could be random (atactic). These arrangements have different physical properties.\nPolymerization reactions will also consume hydrogen, which is required to quench the reaction (i.e., end the chains), and some will involve a secondary ingredient (known as a comonomer). Since the concentrations of these components in the reactor affect the probabilities that specific reactions will take place, the composition in the reactor effectively sets the amount of branching and the length of the chain.\n\u25b2Figure 1. Ethylene is a stable molecule with two carbon atoms connected by a double bond. Polyethylene is made by the reaction of multiple ethylene molecules in the presence of catalyst.\nThe polymer industry employs many catalysts, and new catalysts are developed every year. Different catalysts are used to create polymers with particular properties, even in the same reactor. Each PE or PP process licensor incorporates proprietary catalyst formulations in its reactor designs. Depending on the type of reactor, the catalysts can be solid particles or suspended in hydrocarbon or solvent.\nPolymerization is a highly exothermic reaction, and it requires continuous cooling to prevent runaway reactions. Most reactor systems include an emergency quench that quickly shuts down the reactor if the temperature reaches a predetermined setpoint. Before the implementation of redundant control mechanisms, a runaway reaction could cause the reactor to become completely plugged with plastic. Process designs have since changed and safety systems have been implemented to prevent such incidents.\n\u25b2Figure 2. Polypropylene is made by breaking the double bond in a propylene molecule in the presence of a catalyst. The resulting polymer may be isotactic, with all of the methyl groups on the same side of the polymer backbone, syndiotactic, with alternate methyl groups on opposite sides of the backbone, or atactic (not shown), with the methyl groups arranged randomly.\n\u25b2Figure 3. The molecular weight distribution of a bimodal polymer has more than one peak.\nAlthough polymer properties can be modified somewhat in the blending and extruding steps, the conditions in the reactor set the product grade(s) \u2014 as defined by a few key quality measures \u2014 that can be made. In general, polyethylene is categorized based on its density, the linearity of the molecules (i.e., degree of branching), and its molecular weight (length of the chains). Other polymer qualities, including the molten flowing property, known as the melt-flow index, are a function of the crystalline structure and are also primarily determined by the polymerization reaction. The melt-flow index determines the polymer\u2019s behavior in downstream operations, such as extrusion, blow molding, or film production.\nThe most common polyethylene grades are:\nNo problem.

The plastics are eventually delivered to customers using barges, trucks, or rail cars.\nThis article describes the different polyolefin production processes, their key operating parameters, and ways to use automation for improved quality control and higher throughput.\nIt\u2019s helpful to understand some of the chemistry behind the polymerization reaction to appreciate how the process works and the complexity involved in making plastic. A polymerization reaction starts with a primary ingredient (monomer), such as ethylene or propylene.\nEthylene (C2H4) is a stable molecule with two carbon atoms and a double bond. Polyethylene (PE) is a made by the reaction of multiple ethylene molecules in the presence of catalyst to break the double bond and connect the carbon atoms into a chain (Figure 1). The longer the chain, the higher the molecular weight. Polymers can have molecular weights in the millions.\nSimilarly, polypropylene (PP) is made by breaking the double bond in a propylene (C3H6) molecule, in the presence of a catalyst, to form long chains of three-carbon-atom molecules (Figure 2). The third carbon atom adds a complexity: On which side of the chain will the methyl (CH3) groups fall? They could all be on one side of the chain\u2019s centerline, or backbone (isotactic), they could appear alternately on opposite sides of the backbone (syndiotactic), or their positions could be random (atactic). These arrangements have different physical properties.\nPolymerization reactions will also consume hydrogen, which is required to quench the reaction (i.e., end the chains), and some will involve a secondary ingredient (known as a comonomer). Since the concentrations of these components in the reactor affect the probabilities that specific reactions will take place, the composition in the reactor effectively sets the amount of branching and the length of the chain.\n\u25b2Figure 1. Ethylene is a stable molecule with two carbon atoms connected by a double bond. Polyethylene is made by the reaction of multiple ethylene molecules in the presence of catalyst.\nThe polymer industry employs many catalysts, and new catalysts are developed every year. Different catalysts are used to create polymers with particular properties, even in the same reactor. Each PE or PP process licensor incorporates proprietary catalyst formulations in its reactor designs. Depending on the type of reactor, the catalysts can be solid particles or suspended in hydrocarbon or solvent.\nPolymerization is a highly exothermic reaction, and it requires continuous cooling to prevent runaway reactions. Most reactor systems include an emergency quench that quickly shuts down the reactor if the temperature reaches a predetermined setpoint. Before the implementation of redundant control mechanisms, a runaway reaction could cause the reactor to become completely plugged with plastic. Process designs have since changed and safety systems have been implemented to prevent such incidents.\n\u25b2Figure 2. Polypropylene is made by breaking the double bond in a propylene molecule in the presence of a catalyst. The resulting polymer may be isotactic, with all of the methyl groups on the same side of the polymer backbone, syndiotactic, with alternate methyl groups on opposite sides of the backbone, or atactic (not shown), with the methyl groups arranged randomly.\n\u25b2Figure 3. The molecular weight distribution of a bimodal polymer has more than one peak.\nAlthough polymer properties can be modified somewhat in the blending and extruding steps, the conditions in the reactor set the product grade(s) \u2014 as defined by a few key quality measures \u2014 that can be made. In general, polyethylene is categorized based on its density, the linearity of the molecules (i.e., degree of branching), and its molecular weight (length of the chains). Other polymer qualities, including the molten flowing property, known as the melt-flow index, are a function of the crystalline structure and are also primarily determined by the polymerization reaction. The melt-flow index determines the polymer\u2019s behavior in downstream operations, such as extrusion, blow molding, or film production.\nThe most common polyethylene grades are:\nNo problem.

This article explains the chemistry and production processes behind two of the most popular plastics \u2014 polyethylene and polypropylene.\nPlastics are some of the world\u2019s most diverse and useful manufacturing materials. While plastics encompass a large number of materials, polyethylene and polypropylene are two of the major plastic types found in many consumer goods, from car parts to shopping bags to water pipes.\nSeveral types of reactors can make polymers, including fluidized-bed, loop, autoclave, and tubular reactors. Different grades of polyethylene and polypropylene offer a wide range of physical properties, such as density, stiffness, flexibility, opacity, melting point, texture, and strength. Manipulating variables in the reactor, such as monomer, comonomer, catalyst, and cooling media flowrates, can control key quality parameters. Additives and colorings can modify the appearance of the polymer.\nPolymer plants are semi-continuous processes. Raw material is fed into a reactor continuously at the front end, while polymer powder and pellets are packaged in batches. Most sites operate multiple lines with many bins and silos for storage and blending.

This article explains the chemistry and production processes behind two of the most popular plastics \u2014 polyethylene and polypropylene.\nPlastics are some of the world\u2019s most diverse and useful manufacturing materials. While plastics encompass a large number of materials, polyethylene and polypropylene are two of the major plastic types found in many consumer goods, from car parts to shopping bags to water pipes.\nSeveral types of reactors can make polymers, including fluidized-bed, loop, autoclave, and tubular reactors. Different grades of polyethylene and polypropylene offer a wide range of physical properties, such as density, stiffness, flexibility, opacity, melting point, texture, and strength. Manipulating variables in the reactor, such as monomer, comonomer, catalyst, and cooling media flowrates, can control key quality parameters. Additives and colorings can modify the appearance of the polymer.\nPolymer plants are semi-continuous processes. Raw material is fed into a reactor continuously at the front end, while polymer powder and pellets are packaged in batches. Most sites operate multiple lines with many bins and silos for storage and blending. The plastics are eventually delivered to customers using barges, trucks, or rail cars.\nThis article describes the different polyolefin production processes, their key operating parameters, and ways to use automation for improved quality control and higher throughput.\nIt\u2019s helpful to understand some of the chemistry behind the polymerization reaction to appreciate how the process works and the complexity involved in making plastic. A polymerization reaction starts with a primary ingredient (monomer), such as ethylene or propylene.\nEthylene (C2H4) is a stable molecule with two carbon atoms and a double bond. Polyethylene (PE) is a made by the reaction of multiple ethylene molecules in the presence of catalyst to break the double bond and connect the carbon atoms into a chain (Figure 1). The longer the chain, the higher the molecular weight. Polymers can have molecular weights in the millions.\nSimilarly, polypropylene (PP) is made by breaking the double bond in a propylene (C3H6) molecule, in the presence of a catalyst, to form long chains of three-carbon-atom molecules (Figure 2). The third carbon atom adds a complexity: On which side of the chain will the methyl (CH3) groups fall? They could all be on one side of the chain\u2019s centerline, or backbone (isotactic), they could appear alternately on opposite sides of the backbone (syndiotactic), or their positions could be random (atactic). These arrangements have different physical properties.\nPolymerization reactions will also consume hydrogen, which is required to quench the reaction (i.e., end the chains), and some will involve a secondary ingredient (known as a comonomer). Since the concentrations of these components in the reactor affect the probabilities that specific reactions will take place, the composition in the reactor effectively sets the amount of branching and the length of the chain.\n\u25b2Figure 1. Ethylene is a stable molecule with two carbon atoms connected by a double bond. Polyethylene is made by the reaction of multiple ethylene molecules in the presence of catalyst.\nThe polymer industry employs many catalysts, and new catalysts are developed every year. Different catalysts are used to create polymers with particular properties, even in the same reactor. Each PE or PP process licensor incorporates proprietary catalyst formulations in its reactor designs. Depending on the type of reactor, the catalysts can be solid particles or suspended in hydrocarbon or solvent.\nPolymerization is a highly exothermic reaction, and it requires continuous cooling to prevent runaway reactions. Most reactor systems include an emergency quench that quickly shuts down the reactor if the temperature reaches a predetermined setpoint. Before the implementation of redundant control mechanisms, a runaway reaction could cause the reactor to become completely plugged with plastic. Process designs have since changed and safety systems have been implemented to prevent such incidents.\n\u25b2Figure 2. Polypropylene is made by breaking the double bond in a propylene molecule in the presence of a catalyst. The resulting polymer may be isotactic, with all of the methyl groups on the same side of the polymer backbone, syndiotactic, with alternate methyl groups on opposite sides of the backbone, or atactic (not shown), with the methyl groups arranged randomly.\n\u25b2Figure 3. The molecular weight distribution of a bimodal polymer has more than one peak.\nAlthough polymer properties can be modified somewhat in the blending and extruding steps, the conditions in the reactor set the product grade(s) \u2014 as defined by a few key quality measures \u2014 that can be made. In general, polyethylene is categorized based on its density, the linearity of the molecules (i.e., degree of branching), and its molecular weight (length of the chains). Other polymer qualities, including the molten flowing property, known as the melt-flow index, are a function of the crystalline structure and are also primarily determined by the polymerization reaction. The melt-flow index determines the polymer\u2019s behavior in downstream operations, such as extrusion, blow molding, or film production.\nThe most common polyethylene grades are:\nNo problem.

A polymerization reaction starts with a primary ingredient (monomer), such as ethylene or propylene.\nEthylene (C2H4) is a stable molecule with two carbon atoms and a double bond. Polyethylene (PE) is a made by the reaction of multiple ethylene molecules in the presence of catalyst to break the double bond and connect the carbon atoms into a chain (Figure 1). The longer the chain, the higher the molecular weight. Polymers can have molecular weights in the millions.\nSimilarly, polypropylene (PP) is made by breaking the double bond in a propylene (C3H6) molecule, in the presence of a catalyst, to form long chains of three-carbon-atom molecules (Figure 2). The third carbon atom adds a complexity: On which side of the chain will the methyl (CH3) groups fall? They could all be on one side of the chain\u2019s centerline, or backbone (isotactic), they could appear alternately on opposite sides of the backbone (syndiotactic), or their positions could be random (atactic). These arrangements have different physical properties.\nPolymerization reactions will also consume hydrogen, which is required to quench the reaction (i.e., end the chains), and some will involve a secondary ingredient (known as a comonomer). Since the concentrations of these components in the reactor affect the probabilities that specific reactions will take place, the composition in the reactor effectively sets the amount of branching and the length of the chain.\n\u25b2Figure 1. Ethylene is a stable molecule with two carbon atoms connected by a double bond. Polyethylene is made by the reaction of multiple ethylene molecules in the presence of catalyst.\nThe polymer industry employs many catalysts, and new catalysts are developed every year. Different catalysts are used to create polymers with particular properties, even in the same reactor. Each PE or PP process licensor incorporates proprietary catalyst formulations in its reactor designs. Depending on the type of reactor, the catalysts can be solid particles or suspended in hydrocarbon or solvent.\nPolymerization is a highly exothermic reaction, and it requires continuous cooling to prevent runaway reactions. Most reactor systems include an emergency quench that quickly shuts down the reactor if the temperature reaches a predetermined setpoint. Before the implementation of redundant control mechanisms, a runaway reaction could cause the reactor to become completely plugged with plastic. Process designs have since changed and safety systems have been implemented to prevent such incidents.\n\u25b2Figure 2. Polypropylene is made by breaking the double bond in a propylene molecule in the presence of a catalyst. The resulting polymer may be isotactic, with all of the methyl groups on the same side of the polymer backbone, syndiotactic, with alternate methyl groups on opposite sides of the backbone, or atactic (not shown), with the methyl groups arranged randomly.\n\u25b2Figure 3. The molecular weight distribution of a bimodal polymer has more than one peak.\nAlthough polymer properties can be modified somewhat in the blending and extruding steps, the conditions in the reactor set the product grade(s) \u2014 as defined by a few key quality measures \u2014 that can be made. In general, polyethylene is categorized based on its density, the linearity of the molecules (i.e., degree of branching), and its molecular weight (length of the chains). Other polymer qualities, including the molten flowing property, known as the melt-flow index, are a function of the crystalline structure and are also primarily determined by the polymerization reaction. The melt-flow index determines the polymer\u2019s behavior in downstream operations, such as extrusion, blow molding, or film production.\nThe most common polyethylene grades are:\nNo problem.

How much oil is used to make plastic? - EIA | reliability=high (1.00)\n     URL: https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=34&t=6\n     Summary: The article explains that plastics are produced from natural gas and crude oil feedstocks, which are processed into petrochemical feedstocks like naphtha and hydrocarbon gas liquids. These feedstocks are then chemically transformed into the monomers used to create plastics, supporting the claim that oil and gas molecules are chemically bonded to produce monomers.\n  2. How Are Plastic Bottles Made? : O.Berk Company | reliability=medium (0.60)\n     URL: https://www.oberk.com/packaging-crash-course/how-are-plastic-bottles-made-temp\n     Summary: The article explains that plastics, including plastic bottles, are made from petrochemical feedstocks derived from crude oil and natural gas, which are processed to create monomers like ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid. This supports the claim that plastic bottles are made by chemically bonding oil and gas molecules to create monomers.\n  3. How Plastics Are Made - Manufacturing - BioProcess International | reliability=medium (0.60)\n     URL: https://www.bioprocessintl.com/manufacturing/how-plastics-are-made\n     Summary: The article explains that monomers used to make plastics, such as polyethylene and polypropylene, are derived from oil and natural gas, indicating a chemical bonding process involving these materials.\n  4. How plastics are made - Plastics Europe | reliability=medium (0.60)\n     URL: https://plasticseurope.org/plastics-explained/how-plastics-are-made/\n     Summary: The article explains that plastics, including polyethylene and polypropylene, are made from monomers such as ethylene and propylene, which are derived from natural materials like crude oil and natural gas. This supports the claim that plastic bottles are made by chemically bonding oil and gas molecules to create monomers.\n  5. Making Plastics: From Monomer to Polymer | AIChE | reliability=medium (0.60)\n     URL: https://www.aiche.org/resources/publications/cep/2015/september/making-plastics-monomer-polymer\n     Summary: The article explains that plastics like polyethylene and polypropylene are made from monomers such as ethylene and propylene, which are derived from oil and gas. This supports the claim that plastic bottles are made by chemically bonding oil and gas molecules to create monomers.\n  6. Petrochemistry: How plastic is made from crude oil - YouTube | reliability=medium (0.60)\n     URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qQS4VMeh1s\n     Summary: The article explains that plastics are produced from feedstocks derived from both natural gas and crude oil refining, indicating that oil and gas molecules are indeed chemically processed to create the basic building blocks for plastics, which aligns with the claim.\n\nProvide the structured verdict.\n",
