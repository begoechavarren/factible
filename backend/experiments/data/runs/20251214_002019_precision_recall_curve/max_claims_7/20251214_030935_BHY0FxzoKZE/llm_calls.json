    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nWhat if I told you there was something that you can do right now that would have an immediate, positive benefit for your brain including your mood and your focus? And what if I told you that same thing could actually last a long time and protect your brain from different conditions like depression, Alzheimer's disease or dementia. Would you do it? Yes! I am talking about the powerful effects of physical activity. Simply moving your body, has immediate, long-lasting and protective benefits for your brain. And that can last for the rest of your life. So what I want to do today is tell you a story about how I used my deep understanding of neuroscience, as a professor of neuroscience, to essentially do an experiment on myself in which I discovered the science underlying why exercise is the most transformative thing that you can do for your brain today. Now, as a neuroscientist, I know that our brains, that is the thing in our head right now, that is the most complex structure known to humankind. But it's one thing to talk about the brain, and it's another to see it. So here is a real preserved human brain. And it's going to illustrate two key areas that we are going to talk about today. The first is the prefrontal cortex, right behind your forehead, critical for things like decision-making, focus, attention and your personality. The second key area is located in the temporal lobe, shown right here. You have two temporal lobes in your brain, the right and the left, and deep in the temporal lobe is a key structure critical for your ability to form and retain new long-term memories for facts and events. And that structure is called the hippocampus. So I've always been fascinated with the hippocampus. How could it be that an event that lasts just a moment, say, your first kiss, or the moment your first child was born, can form a memory that has changed your brain, that lasts an entire lifetime? That's what I want to understand. I wanted to start and record the activity of individual brain cells in the hippocampus as subjects were forming new memories. And essentially try and decode how those brief bursts of electrical activity, which is how neurons communicate with each other, how those brief bursts either allowed us to form a new memory, or did not. But a few years ago, I did something very unusual in science. As a full professor of neural science, I decided to completely switch my research program. Because I encountered something that was so amazing, with the potential to change so many lives that I had to study it. I discovered and I experienced the brain-changing effects of exercise. And I did it in a completely inadvertent way. I was actually at the height of all the memory work that I was doing -- data was pouring in, I was becoming known in my field for all of this memory work. And it should have been going great. It was, scientifically. But when I stuck my head out of my lab door, I noticed something. I had no social life. I spent too much time listening to those brain cells in a dark room, by myself. (Laughter) I didn't move my body at all. I had gained 25 pounds. And actually, it took me many years to realize it, I was actually miserable. And I shouldn't be miserable. And I went on a river-rafting trip -- by myself, because I had no social life. And I came back -- (Laughter) thinking, \"Oh, my God, I was the weakest person on that trip.\" And I came back with a mission. I said, \"I'm never going to feel like the weakest person on a river-rafting trip again.\" And that's what made me go to the gym. And I focused my type-A personality on going to all the exercise classes at the gym. I tried everything. I went to kickbox, dance, yoga, step class, and at first it was really hard. But what I noticed is that after every sweat-inducing workout that I tried, I had this great mood boost and this great energy boost. And that's what kept me going back to the gym. Well, I started feeling stronger. I started feeling better, I even lost that 25 pounds. And now, fast-forward a year and a half into this regular exercise program and I noticed something that really made me sit up and take notice. I was sitting at my desk, writing a research grant, and a thought went through my mind that had never gone through my mind before. And that thought was, \"Gee, grant-writing is going well today.\" And all the scientists -- (Laughter) yeah, all the scientists always laugh when I say that, because grant-writing never goes well. It is so hard; you're always pulling your hair out, trying to come up with that million-dollar-winning idea. But I realized that the grant-writing was going well, because I was able to focus and maintain my attention for longer than I had before. And my long-term memory -- what I was studying in my own lab -- seemed to be better in me. And that's when I put it together. Maybe all that exercise that I had included and added to my life was changing my brain. Maybe I did an experiment on myself without even knowing it. So as a curious neuroscientist, I went to the literature to see what I could find about what we knew about the effects of exercise on the brain. And what I found was an exciting and a growing literature that was essentially showing everything that I noticed in myself. Better mood, better energy, better memory, better attention. And the more I learned, the more I realized how powerful exercise was. Which eventually led me to the big decision to completely shift my research focus. And so now, after several years of really focusing on this question, I've come to the following conclusion: that exercise is the most transformative thing that you can do for your brain today for the following three reasons. Number one: it has immediate effects on your brain. A single workout that you do will immediately increase levels of neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline. That is going to increase your mood right after that workout, exactly what I was feeling. My lab showed that a single workout can improve your ability to shift and focus attention, and that focus improvement will last for at least two hours. And finally, studies have shown that a single workout will improve your reaction times which basically means that you are going to be faster at catching that cup of Starbucks that falls off the counter, which is very, very important. (Laughter) But these immediate effects are transient, they help you right after. What you have to do is do what I did, that is change your exercise regime, increase your cardiorespiratory function, to get the long-lasting effects. And these effects are long-lasting because exercise actually changes the brain's anatomy, physiology and function. Let's start with my favorite brain area, the hippocampus. The hippocampus -- or exercise actually produces brand new brain cells, new brain cells in the hippocampus, that actually increase its volume, as well as improve your long-term memory, OK? And that including in you and me. Number two: the most common finding in neuroscience studies, looking at effects of long-term exercise, is improved attention function dependent on your prefrontal cortex. You not only get better focus and attention, but the volume of the hippocampus increases as well. And finally, you not only get immediate effects of mood with exercise but those last for a long time. So you get long-lasting increases in those good mood neurotransmitters. But really, the most transformative thing that exercise will do is its protective effects on your brain. Here you can think about the brain like a muscle. The more you're working out, the bigger and stronger your hippocampus and prefrontal cortex gets. Why is that important? Because the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus are the two areas that are most susceptible to neurodegenerative diseases and normal cognitive decline in aging. So with increased exercise over your lifetime, you're not going to cure dementia or Alzheimer's disease, but what you're going to do is you're going to create the strongest, biggest hippocampus and prefrontal cortex so it takes longer for these diseases to actually have an effect. You can think of exercise, therefore, as a supercharged 401K for your brain, OK? And it's even better, because it's free. So this is the point in the talk where everybody says, \"That sounds so interesting, Wendy, but I really will only want to know one thing. And that is, just tell me the minimum amount of exercise I need to get all these changes.\" (Laughter) And so I'm going to tell you the answer to that question. First, good news: you don't have to become a triathlete to get these effects. The rule of thumb is you want to get three to four times a week exercise minimum 30 minutes an exercise session, and you want to get aerobic exercise in. That is, get your heart rate up. And the good news is, you don't have to go to the gym to get a very expensive gym membership. Add an extra walk around the block in your power walk. You see stairs -- take stairs. And power-vacuuming can be as good as the aerobics class that you were going to take at the gym. So I've gone from memory pioneer to exercise explorer. From going into the innermost workings of the brain, to trying to understand how exercise can improve our brain function, and my goal in my lab right now is to go beyond that rule of thumb that I just gave you -- three to four times a week, 30 minutes. I want to understand the optimum exercise prescription for you, at your age, at your fitness level, for your genetic background, to maximize the effects of exercise today and also to improve your brain and protect your brain the best for the rest of your life. But it's one thing to talk about exercise, and it's another to do it. So I'm going to invoke my power as a certified exercise instructor, to ask you all to stand up. (Laughter) We're going to do just one minute of exercise. It's call-and-response, just do what I do, say what I say, and make sure you don't punch your neighbor, OK? Music! (Upbeat music) Five, six, seven, eight, it's right, left, right, left. And I say, I am strong now. Let's hear you. Audience: I am strong now. Wendy Suzuki: Ladies, I am Wonder Woman-strong. Let's hear you! Audience: I am Wonder Woman-strong. WS: New move -- uppercut, right and left. I am inspired now. You say it! Audience: I am inspired now. WS: Last move -- pull it down, right and left, right and left. I say, I am on fire now! You say it. Audience: I am on fire now. WS: And done! OK, good job! (Applause) Thank you. I want to leave you with one last thought. And that is, bringing exercise in your life will not only give you a happier, more protective life today, but it will protect your brain from incurable diseases. And in this way it will change the trajectory of your life for the better. Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)",

However, only recently the health consequences of a sedentary lifestyle, and of highly energetic diets, are becoming clear. It has been also acknowledged that lifestyle and diet can induce epigenetic modifications which modify chromatin structure and gene expression, thus causing even heritable metabolic outcomes. Many studies have shown that PA can reverse at least some of the unwanted effects of sedentary lifestyle, and can also contribute in delaying brain aging and degenerative pathologies such as Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, diabetes, and multiple sclerosis. Most importantly, PA improves cognitive processes and memory, has analgesic and antidepressant effects, and even induces a sense of wellbeing, giving strength to the ancient principle of \u201cmens sana in corpore sano\u201d (i.e., a sound mind in a sound body). In this review we will discuss the potential mechanisms underlying the effects of PA on brain health, focusing on hormones, neurotrophins, and neurotransmitters, the release of which is modulated by PA, as well as on the intra- and extra-cellular pathways that regulate the expression of some of the genes involved.\nKeywords: physical activity, brain health, myokines, BDNF, Irisin, lactate, exercise and neurodegeneration, exercise and aging\nThe discovery of the nervous system dates back to the ancient Greek physicians-philosophers Alcmaeon, Praxagoras, Herophilus [1,2], and Erasistratus [2]. Herophilus (c335\u2013c280 B.C.), in particular, by dissecting human cadavers, was able to describe the structure of the brain and nerves, and to realize that motor nerves were joined to muscles, while other nerves (the sensory ones) went to organs, and were responsible for sensation. He promoted a cerebrocentric view of mind [1,2,3,4,5] and, interestingly, believed that exercise and a healthy diet were fundamental for maintaining a healthy body, and a healthy mind [3]. Over the centuries this idea has recurred many times. However, we have only recently begun to understand the cellular and molecular reasons why sedentary life is detrimental for human health, and to realize that physical activity (PA) can be a powerful medicine to counteract its effects. Actually, this is not surprising since the ability of our species to survive in many different environments, to escape predators, and to look around for food has depended on, and still depends on the ability to perform PA, and PA has thus shaped our physiology [6]. Starting from the consideration that modern humans have not only a very large brain but also a remarkable endurance capacity, it was suggested that PA also shaped our brains: It was reported, for example, that the appearance in evolution of skeletal properties related to endurance capacity correlated with the increase of brain size in hominins such as Homo erectus [7,8,9]. As reported by Hill and Polk [9], aerobic fitness (required for successful endurance activity), and aerobic capacity (measured as maximal oxygen consumption during exercise, VO2 max) correlate with brain size, both in humans and other animals; moreover, selective breeding in rodents for endurance running capacity affects both their general physiology and their brain, and also potentiates their cognitive abilities [9,10]. A further aspect of humans that might correlate with PA concerns the integumentary system: Our hairless skin indeed enhances evaporation, thus allowing dispersion of excess heat produced during endurance activity [9,11,12,13]; at the same time, a hairless skin facilitates production of vasodilatory factors, such as nitric oxide (NO), with different mechanisms [14,15].\nIn this context, it is important to underline that, when the importance of PA during the evolution of our species is discussed, the focus is on every movement that requires activity of our skeletal muscles, and energy expenditure. On the other hand, any planned and structured activity that is voluntarily aimed at improving and/or maintaining our physical fitness should be better defined as exercise [16]. Thus, most of the experimental work cited in this review actually concerns \u201cexercise\u201d since the observations reported rely on a specific series of structured, planned, and repetitive activities. Exercise is, however, only a subset of physical activity; accordingly, we will use the term \u201cexercise\u201d when describing the results of programmed sets of experiments, and the expression \u201cphysical activity\u201d (PA) when discussing the effects on health of either programmed or not programmed skeletal muscle movements, in daily life.\nThere are clear indications that PA also has important effects on human brain health at any age and have been included, for example, in the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in 2018 [17,18,19]. Interestingly, in these guidelines, four classes of age, with different PA requirements, have been set: 1. Preschool-Aged Children (3\u20135 years)\u2014they should be physically active throughout the day to enhance growth and development, it is also important to underline that playing develops mental capacities and social interactions in many ways; 2. Children and Adolescents (6\u201317 years)\u2014they should do 60 min or more per day of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, most of which should be aerobic, with vigorous activity for at least 3 days per week, including muscle- and bone-strengthening physical activity; 3.

There are multiple mechanisms that account for the brain-enhancing effects of exercise, including neuroinflammation, vascularization, antioxidation, energy adaptation, and regulations on neurotrophic factors and neurotransmitters. Dopamine (DA), noradrenaline (NE), and serotonin (5-HT) are the three major monoamine neurotransmitters that are known to be modulated by exercise. This review focuses on how these three neurotransmitters contribute to exercise affecting brain function and how it can work against neurological disorders.\nKeywords: exercise, brain function, monoamine\nRegular physical exercise has been proved to have therapeutic benefit [1], such as treating psychiatric illnesses [2,3,4,5,6,7], supporting brain injury recovery [8,9,10,11,12], and resisting neurodegenerative diseases [13,14,15,16,17,18]. The advantageous effects of exercise on brain functions have been attributed to increased capacities of metabolism reserve and antioxidation [19,20]. Furthermore, regulations of the secretion of neurotrophic factors, vasculotropic factors, inflammatory mediators, and neurotransmitters are also involved in exercise\u2019s influence on brain function [21,22,23,24,25]. Among these effects, secretion of neurotransmitters, especially monoamines, have been linked to the exercise-induced neuronal adaptation. Interplay between exercise and monoamines was initially derived from the \u201cCentral Fatigue Hypothesis\u201d, in which increased brain 5-HT release was found to be associated with central fatigue [26,27]. 5-HT is linked to fatigue because of its known effects on sleep, lethargy, and loss of motivation. The hypothesis prompted researchers to investigate the role of 5-HT in exercise-induced central fatigue [28,29,30,31,32,33]. Results suggest that exercise-induced central fatigue is more complex and depends on the intensity and duration of exercise. Overtraining exercise may stimulate hyperactivation of the monoamine systems which could cause fatigue [34,35,36]. Rodents that receive exhaustive treadmill exercise have higher 5-HT in the midbrain, striatum, hypothalamus and hippocampus [37]. The levels of dopamine are increased only in the striatum, although the levels of DOPAC, the major DA metabolite, are increased in both midbrain and striatum. On the other hand, exhaustive treadmill exercise reduces NE levels in the hypothalamus and brain stem [38]. Chronic moderate exercise is also known to stimulate the monoamine systems, but exercise of this sort does not induce central fatigue. Instead, chronic moderate exercise has been recognized as one of the most effective ways to enhance the adaptation/plasticity of the central nervous system (CNS). In addition, clinical studies suggest that monoamine systems play central roles resistance and recovery induced by chronic moderate exercise from various diseases like mental disorders [39] and Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) [40]. This article reviews recent studies that emphasize the effects of exercise on brain functions due to monoamine systems.\nThe catecholamines (DA, NE) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) are the chief players of the monoamine neurotransmitter family. All three monoamines can be re-uptake by specific transporters from the synaptic spaces back into cytosol. Furthermore, they share common activation mechanism mediated through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). We shall first briefly introduce the biosynthesis of DA, NE and 5-HT, as well as the biological properties of their receptors.\nDA is synthesized from l-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA), which is catalyzed from amino acid tyrosine by enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase. l-DOPA is then converted to DA by the catalysis of enzyme DOPA decarboxylase (or aromatic amino acid decarboxylase). In the CNS, dopaminergic neurons mainly reside in two nuclei of the midbrain: substantia nigra and ventral tegmental nucleus. Axons of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra project to the striatum (nigrostriatal pathway) which in turn is responsible for movement behavior. Axons of the ventral tegmental nucleus dopaminergic neurons project to the entire cortex (mesocortical pathway) and nucleus accumbens (mesolimbic pathway), which are involved in cognition and reward responses, respectively.\nThere are five types of DA receptors (D1 to D5), which are simply categorized in two families of GPCR: D1-like and D2-like receptors. The D1-like receptor family contains D1 and D5 receptors that are coupled with Gs and Gq protein [41,42,43,44]. The D2-like receptor family comprises of D2, D3 and D4 receptors which couple with the Gi proteins to inhibit adenylyl cyclase [43,44]. D2-like receptors can be found on both pre- and post-synaptic terminals, while D1-like receptors are mainly located at post-synaptic sites [43]. The actions of DA receptors on membrane excitability are well defined in the striatal neurons [45,46,47,48,49]. Both D1 and D2 receptors are capable of modulating long-term depression; activation of D1 receptor enhances long-term depression, while activation of D2 receptor inhibits long-term depression [50]. Furthermore, D1 and D2 receptors modulate motor functions by modifying the excitatory transmission between the presynaptic cortical glutamatergic neurons and the post-synaptic striatal GABAergic neurons [46].\nNE is synthesized by further hydroxylation of DA. In the CNS, NE is released by the noradrenergic neurons which are mainly present in the locus coeruleus. The axons of noradrenergic neurons innervate the whole cerebral cortex, various subcortical areas, cerebellum and brain stem [51].\nTraditionally, noradrenergic receptors are divided into three types: \u03b11, \u03b12 and \u03b2. So far, three \u03b11 subtypes (\u03b11a, \u03b11b, \u03b11d), four \u03b12-receptor subtypes (\u03b12A\u2013D), and three \u03b2 subtypes (\u03b21\u20133) receptors have been identified;\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Hippocampal and medial temporal lobe volumes are larger in higher-fit adults, and physical activity training increases hippocampal perfusion, but the extent to which aerobic exercise training can modify hippocampal volume in late adulthood remains unknown. Here we show, in a randomized controlled trial with 120 older adults, that aerobic exercise training increases the size of the anterior hippocampus, leading to improvements in spatial memory. Exercise training increased hippocampal volume by 2%, effectively reversing age-related loss in volume by 1 to 2 y. We also demonstrate that increased hippocampal volume is associated with greater serum levels of BDNF, a mediator of neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus. Hippocampal volume declined in the control group, but higher preintervention fitness partially attenuated the decline, suggesting that fitness protects against volume loss. Caudate nucleus and thalamus volumes were unaffected by the intervention. These theoretically important findings indicate that aerobic exercise training is effective at reversing hippocampal volume loss in late adulthood, which is accompanied by improved memory function.\nKeywords: aging, brain, cognition, plasticity, MRI\nDeterioration of the hippocampus precedes and leads to memory impairment in late adulthood (1, 2). Strategies to fight hippocampal loss and protect against the development of memory impairment has become an important topic in recent years from both scientific and public health perspectives. Physical activity, such as aerobic exercise, has emerged as a promising low-cost treatment to improve neurocognitive function that is accessible to most adults and is not plagued by intolerable side effects often found with pharmaceutical treatments (3). Exercise enhances learning and improves retention, which is accompanied by increased cell proliferation and survival in the hippocampus of rodents (4\u20136); effects that are mediated, in part, by increased production and secretion of BDNF and its receptor tyrosine kinase trkB (7, 8).\nAerobic exercise training increases gray and white matter volume in the prefrontal cortex (9) of older adults and increases the functioning of key nodes in the executive control network (10, 11). Greater amounts of physical activity are associated with sparing of prefrontal and temporal brain regions over a 9-y period, which reduces the risk for cognitive impairment (12). Further, hippocampal and medial temporal lobe volumes are larger in higher-fit older adults (13, 14), and larger hippocampal volumes mediate improvements in spatial memory (13). Exercise training increases cerebral blood volume (15) and perfusion of the hippocampus (16), but the extent to which exercise can modify the size of the hippocampus in late adulthood remains unknown.\nTo evaluate whether exercise training increases the size of the hippocampus and improves spatial memory, we designed a single-blind, randomized controlled trial in which adults were randomly assigned to receive either moderate-intensity aerobic exercise 3 d/wk or stretching and toning exercises that served as a control. We predicted that 1 y of moderate-intensity exercise would increase the size of the hippocampus and that change in hippocampal volume would be associated with increased serum BDNF and improved memory function.\nOne hundred twenty older adults without dementia (Table 1) were randomly assigned to an aerobic exercise group (n = 60) or to a stretching control group (n = 60). Magnetic resonance images were collected before the intervention, after 6 mo, and again after the completion of the program. The groups did not differ at baseline in hippocampal volume or attendance rates (Table 2 and SI Results). We found that the exercise intervention was effective at increasing the size of the hippocampus. That is, the aerobic exercise group demonstrated an increase in volume of the left and right hippocampus by 2.12% and 1.97%, respectively, over the 1-y period, whereas the stretching control group displayed a 1.40% and 1.43% decline over this same interval (Fig. 1A). The moderating effect of aerobic exercise on hippocampal volume loss was confirmed by a significant Time \u00d7 Group interaction for both the left [F(2,114) = 8.25; P < 0.001; \u03b7p2 = 0.12] and right [F(2,114) = 10.41; P < 0.001; \u03b7p2 = 0.15] hippocampus (see Table 2 for all means and SDs).\nCharacteristics for the aerobic exercise and stretching control groups\nMeans (SD) for both groups at all three time points\nVO2 max was measured as ml/kg per min.

The Time \u00d7 Group interaction was significant (P < 0.001) for both left and right regions.

Although the exercise group showed an attenuation of decline, this did not reach significance (both P > 0.10). (C) Example of thalamus segmentation and graph demonstrating the change in volume for both groups. None of the changes were significant for the thalamus. Error bars represent SEM.\nAs can be seen in Fig. 2, we found that aerobic exercise selectively increased the volume of the anterior hippocampus that included the dentate gyrus, where cell proliferation occurs (4, 6, 8), as well as subiculum and CA1 subfields, but had a minimal effect on the volume of the posterior section. Cells in the anterior hippocampus mediate acquisition of spatial memory (17) and show more age-related atrophy compared with the tail of the hippocampus (18, 19). The selective effect of aerobic exercise on the anterior hippocampus was confirmed by a \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",
