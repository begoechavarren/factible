Reverse transcription is an essential step in retroviral replication. This article presents an overview of reverse transcription, briefly describes the structure and function of RT, provides an introduction to some of the cellular and viral factors that can affect reverse transcription, and discusses fidelity and recombination, two processes in which reverse transcription plays an important role. In keeping with the theme of the collection, the emphasis is on HIV-1 and HIV-1 RT.\nMore than half of the drugs currently approved to treat HIV-1 infections are reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Therefore, the continued characterization of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and the process of reverse transcription is vital.\nIt has been 40 years since the discovery of reverse transcriptase (RT) was announced by Howard Temin and David Baltimore, who independently showed that retroviral virions contain an enzymatic activity that can copy RNA into DNA (Baltimore 1970; Mizutani et al. 1970). These experiments provided the crucial proof of Temin\u2019s provirus hypothesis that retroviral infections persist because the RNA genome found in the virions is converted into DNA (Temin 1964). The sequences of the genomes of eukaryotes show how pervasive reverse transcription is in nature; not only do these genomes contain large numbers of endogenous retroviruses, but also a variety of retroposons and reverse-transcribed elements. The discovery in the early 1980s, that AIDS is caused by a human retrovirus, HIV-1, invigorated retroviral research and focused attention on the viral enzymes, which have become the primary target of anti-AIDS drugs. Not surprisingly, the focus of RT research shifted from the RTs of the murine leukemia viruses (MLV) and the avian myeloblastosis virus to HIV-1 RT. The first approved anti-HIV drug, AZT, targets RT, and of the 26 drugs currently approved to treat HIV-1 infections, 14 are RT inhibitors. In addition, RTs (primarily recombinant MLV RTs) have become extremely valuable tools that are widely used in research, in clinical/diagnostic tests, and in biotechnology. We provide here a relatively brief description of the process of reverse transcription, the structure and biochemical functions of RT, some information about how other viral and cellular factors influence reverse transcription, and briefly consider how the reverse transcription process affects both the mutations that arise during the retroviral life cycle and recombination. The focus will be HIV-1 and HIV-1 RT; however, in some cases, we will draw on insights and include information obtained with other retroviruses and other RTs. Although the issues of the inhibition of HIV-1 RT by anti-RT drugs and the mechanisms of drug resistance are of considerable importance, these issues will not be addressed in detail here; the reader is directed to Arts and Hazuda (2011). Given that the literature on RT and reverse transcription is both vast and complex, and the space allowed for this article is limited, we have had to make some difficult choices in what to present, and what to omit, both in terms of the material and the references. For the omissions, we apologize.\nWhen a mature HIV-1 virion infects a susceptible target cell, interactions of the envelope glycoprotein with the coreceptors on the surface of the cell brings about a fusion of the membranes of the host cell and the virion (Wilen et al. 2011). This fusion introduces the contents of the virion into the cytoplasm of the cell, setting the stage for reverse transcription. There are complexities to the early events that accompany reverse transcription in an infected cell, not all of which are well understood, which will be considered later in this article. We will begin by discussing the mechanics of the conversion of the single-stranded RNA genome found in the virion into the linear double-stranded DNA that is the substrate for the integration process. The synthesis of this linear DNA is a reasonably well-understood process; additional details and references can be found in the books Retroviruses (Telesnitsky and Goff 1997) and Reverse Transcriptase (Skalka and Goff 1993). In orthoretroviruses, including HIV-1, reverse transcription takes place in newly infected cells. There is some debate in the literature about whether reverse transcription is initiated in producer cells. Primer tagging experiments suggest that most HIV-1 virions initiate reverse transcription in newly infected cells (Whitcomb et al. 1990); however, there are claims that a small number of nucleotides may be incorporated before the virions initiate infection of target cells (Lori et al. 1992; Trono 1992; Zhu and Cunningham 1993; Huang et al. 1997). Either way, the vast majority of the viral DNA is synthesized in newly infected cells. This is a lifestyle choice; spumaretroviruses and the more distantly related hepadna viruses carry out extensive reverse transcription in producer cells (Summers and Mason 1982; Yu et al. 1996, 1999). Although there are viral and cellular factors that assist in the process of reverse transcription (these will be discussed later) the two enzymatic activities that are necessary and sufficient to carry out reverse transcription are present in RT. These are a DNA polymerase that can copy either a RNA or a DNA template, and an RNase H that degrades RNA if, and only if, it is part of an RNA\u2013DNA duplex.\nLike many other DNA polymerases, RT needs both a primer and a template. Genomic RNA is plus-stranded (the genome and the messages are copied from the same DNA strand), and the primer for the synthesis of the first DNA strand (the minus strand) is a host tRNA whose 3\u2032 end is base paired to a compl\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Reverse transcription is an essential step in retroviral replication. This article presents an overview of reverse transcription, briefly describes the structure and function of RT, provides an introduction to some of the cellular and viral factors that can affect reverse transcription, and discusses fidelity and recombination, two processes in which reverse transcription plays an important role. In keeping with the theme of the collection, the emphasis is on HIV-1 and HIV-1 RT.\nMore than half of the drugs currently approved to treat HIV-1 infections are reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Therefore, the continued characterization of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and the process of reverse transcription is vital.\nIt has been 40 years since the discovery of reverse transcriptase (RT) was announced by Howard Temin and David Baltimore, who independently showed that retroviral virions contain an enzymatic activity that can copy RNA into DNA (Baltimore 1970; Mizutani et al. 1970). These experiments provided the crucial proof of Temin\u2019s provirus hypothesis that retroviral infections persist because the RNA genome found in the virions is converted into DNA (Temin 1964). The sequences of the genomes of eukaryotes show how pervasive reverse transcription is in nature; not only do these genomes contain large numbers of endogenous retroviruses, but also a variety of retroposons and reverse-transcribed elements. The discovery in the early 1980s, that AIDS is caused by a human retrovirus, HIV-1, invigorated retroviral research and focused attention on the viral enzymes, which have become the primary target of anti-AIDS drugs. Not surprisingly, the focus of RT research shifted from the RTs of the murine leukemia viruses (MLV) and the avian myeloblastosis virus to HIV-1 RT. The first approved anti-HIV drug, AZT, targets RT, and of the 26 drugs currently approved to treat HIV-1 infections, 14 are RT inhibitors. In addition, RTs (primarily recombinant MLV RTs) have become extremely valuable tools that are widely used in research, in clinical/diagnostic tests, and in biotechnology. We provide here a relatively brief description of the process of reverse transcription, the structure and biochemical functions of RT, some information about how other viral and cellular factors influence reverse transcription, and briefly consider how the reverse transcription process affects both the mutations that arise during the retroviral life cycle and recombination. The focus will be HIV-1 and HIV-1 RT; however, in some cases, we will draw on insights and include information obtained with other retroviruses and other RTs. Although the issues of the inhibition of HIV-1 RT by anti-RT drugs and the mechanisms of drug resistance are of considerable importance, these issues will not be addressed in detail here; the reader is directed to Arts and Hazuda (2011). Given that the literature on RT and reverse transcription is both vast and complex, and the space allowed for this article is limited, we have had to make some difficult choices in what to present, and what to omit, both in terms of the material and the references. For the omissions, we apologize.\nWhen a mature HIV-1 virion infects a susceptible target cell, interactions of the envelope glycoprotein with the coreceptors on the surface of the cell brings about a fusion of the membranes of the host cell and the virion (Wilen et al. 2011). This fusion introduces the contents of the virion into the cytoplasm of the cell, setting the stage for reverse transcription. There are complexities to the early events that accompany reverse transcription in an infected cell, not all of which are well understood, which will be considered later in this article. We will begin by discussing the mechanics of the conversion of the single-stranded RNA genome found in the virion into the linear double-stranded DNA that is the substrate for the integration process. The synthesis of this linear DNA is a reasonably well-understood process; additional details and references can be found in the books Retroviruses (Telesnitsky and Goff 1997) and Reverse Transcriptase (Skalka and Goff 1993). In orthoretroviruses, including HIV-1, reverse transcription takes place in newly infected cells. There is some debate in the literature about whether reverse transcription is initiated in producer cells. Primer tagging experiments suggest that most HIV-1 virions initiate reverse transcription in newly infected cells (Whitcomb et al. 1990); however, there are claims that a small number of nucleotides may be incorporated before the virions initiate infection of target cells (Lori et al. 1992; Trono 1992; Zhu and Cunningham 1993; Huang et al. 1997). Either way, the vast majority of the viral DNA is synthesized in newly infected cells. This is a lifestyle choice; spumaretroviruses and the more distantly related hepadna viruses carry out extensive reverse transcription in producer cells (Summers and Mason 1982; Yu et al. 1996, 1999). Although there are viral and cellular factors that assist in the process of reverse transcription (these will be discussed later) the two enzymatic activities that are necessary and sufficient to carry out reverse transcription are present in RT. These are a DNA polymerase that can copy either a RNA or a DNA template, and an RNase H that degrades RNA if, and only if, it is part of an RNA\u2013DNA duplex.\nLike many other DNA polymerases, RT needs both a primer and a template.

For their role in ensuring that drug, lenacapavir, came to life and to market, the AAAS Mani L. Bhaumik Breakthrough of the Year Award is being awarded to Wesley Sundquist, chair of the University of Utah Department of Biochemistry; Moupali Das, vice president, Clinical Development, HIV Prevention & Pediatrics at Gilead Sciences; and Yvette Raphael, co-founder and executive director of Advocacy for Prevention of HIV in Africa .\n\u201cThese individuals represent the three arms of what is necessary to create new science and then translate it for the world in a way that is really able to make a difference,\u201d said Megan Ranney, dean of the Yale School of Public Health and part of the committee \u2014 convened by Science journals\u2019 Editor-in-Chief Holden Thorp \u2014 that selected the winners.\n\u201cI was excited about how these three tell the story of the journey required to bring a drug into existence,\u201d said committee member William Powderly, co-director of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Washington University School of Medicine. \u201cIt takes multiple people, skillsets and partners.\u201d\nAs of 2023, 39.9 million people globally were living with HIV, newly infecting more than 1 million people a year.\nEven after decades of research, there is no cure for the disease HIV causes, AIDS. But lenacapavir, born out of research on HIV\u2019s cone-shaped capsid protein, gets close, almost completely preventing new HIV infections from occurring. The drug protects people for six months with each shot.\n\u201cThis drug is extraordinary \u2014 the closest thing to a vaccine that we have,\u201d said Ranney. She explained that she and many of her peers in the public health community entered the field at the height of the AIDS pandemic, in the 1980s and 1990s. \u201cThis medication is beyond the wildest dreams of what many of us could have imagined.\u201d\nRecognizing the people behind such significant scientific developments is a central philosophy for donor Mani L. Bhaumik, Ph.D. \u2014 a physicist with myriad contributions to the development of high-powered lasers \u2014 as well as for AAAS and the Science family of journals.\n\u201cStudying intractable parts of the physical world, like a virus capsid, is critical to scientific innovation,\u201d said Bhaumik. \u201cAnd persisting to ensure that insights from basic research insight can be applied and that they are trusted by those who they will serve is critical \u2014 now more than ever. I\u2019m delighted to see this year\u2019s recognition go to people across sectors whose thorough approach made such a valuable contribution.\u201d\nThe Mani L. Bhaumik Breakthrough of the Year Award was established in 2022 with a $11.4 million pledge from Bhaumik: the largest in the organization\u2019s history. The award supports a $250,000 cash prize annually for up to three scientists or researchers whose work best underpins the Science Breakthrough of the Year, the journal\u2019s choice of the top research advance of the year. In 2024, Science named lenacapavir the latest Breakthrough.\nSundquist, who moved to the University of Utah as an assistant professor in 1992, played a key role in the development of the drug, though his work was not immediately recognized. \u201cSundquist spent countless hours in the lab, made a critical discovery, and then watched it sit on the shelf for a while, which can happen in basic science,\u201d said Ranney.\nHis contribution \u2014 which he embarked upon as he started his Utah-based lab \u2014 was elucidating the structure and functions of the HIV virus\u2019s capsid protein. Sundquist focused on the capsid because he was aware that HIV deaths were increasing globally and that most scientists studying HIV treatments were looking at the virus\u2019s enzymes. \u201cWe wanted to work on an aspect of the problem that was unique,\u201d he said, \u201cand we were drawn to the unusual cone-shape of the capsid.\u201d\nUntil Sundquist\u2019s work, scientists thought the capsid, which encloses the virus\u2019s genetic material, was largely a structural element. They did not see it as a particularly \u201cdruggable\u201d target, especially compared to enzymes, in part because it was thought to be highly stable.\nIn 1996, working with a team, Sundquist published a paper in Science that defined the capsid\u2019s architecture. That laid the groundwork for a study in 2003 in the Journal of Virology, in which he and colleagues showed that if the HIV capsid was disrupted, even in minor ways, viral replication was disrupted too.\n\u201cThat was unexpected,\u201d said Sundquist.\nEven as these critical discoveries were made, however, it wasn\u2019t obvious that the capsid would be easily turned into a drug target. For his part, though, Sundquist didn\u2019t feel it was very long after he and his colleagues published their 2003 results that Gilead Sciences contacted them.\nTomas Cihl\u00e1\u0159, a virologist at the company, visited Sundquist\u2019s labs. Impressed with his discoveries, Cihl\u00e1\u0159 took them back to his colleagues. The Gilead team wanted to see if they could use Sundquist\u2019s insights about how to hinder viral replication to design HIV drugs with longer acting power for people living with HIV; while the standard of care treatment \u2014 combination antiretroviral therapy \u2014 worked well, it required daily medication.\nA dedicated group of scientists at Gilead Sciences showed perseverance as it took more than a decade (beginning around 2006) to develop a drug based on Sundquist\u2019s findings. To do so, John Link, then-vice president of Medicinal Chemistry at Gilead, and his colleagues screened thousands of molecules to identify an effective capsid inhibitor.\n\u201cWe sometimes think about industry as not having staying power,\u201d said Ranney. \u201cBut it was something like 15 years here \u2014 fits and starts \u2014\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Different strategies may need to be combined to create synergy to overcome the major challenge represented by the latent viral reservoir.\nKeywords: adoptive natural killer cell therapy, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, bispecific antibodies, HIV reservoir, natural killer cells\nMore than 40 years after its recognition, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic remains a public health threat with 1.3 million new infections and 9.3 million people living without HIV treatment in 2023 [1]. Although the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has increased life expectancy significantly [2] it does not result in a cure. Implications include life-long adherence to ART and drug-related toxicities [3]. Intensive research into HIV prevention has not yet resulted in an approved HIV vaccine [4]. This emphasizes the need for a functional cure which aims to control HIV replication without ART. Latently HIV-1-infected cells harbor replication-competent provirus that can reactivate upon ART cessation, which presents the main obstacle to HIV-1 cure. Davenport et al. outlined two main strategies to induce a functional cure: decreasing the frequency of successful HIV reactivation events to delay the time to rebound, and promoting post-rebound viral control by removing susceptible HIV targets and enhancing host immune control [5]. Natural killer (NK) cells, as innate effector cells, may especially contribute to surveilling reactivating reservoir cells (Fig. 1). Evidence for the importance of NK cells in control of HIV infection comes from studies associating the genetic presence of specific NK cell receptors and certain HLA alleles with delayed progression to AIDS [6,7] and NK cell driven viral evolution [8]. In addition, the HIV vaccine trial RV144, which was the only trial to show moderate success, demonstrated a positive correlation between one of the main NK cell effector functions, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and protection against HIV infection [9,10]. There are a number of excellent articles reviewing the role of NK cells and innate immunity in HIV infection [11\u201314] and approaches to developing a cure [15\u201317]. Therefore, this review will focus on exciting new advancements and promising NK cell strategies targeting the viral reservoir.\nStrategies to harness innate immune surveillance of reactivation events. Following analytical treatment interruption (ATI), block-and-lock strategies aim to silence the latent reservoir. Nonetheless, individual reservoir cells may successfully reactivate causing local viral replication. In the case of rapid immune control these events remain spatially confined, opening up a window of opportunity for immune surveillance before reactivation events result in viral rebound detectable in blood. In this model, we summarize approaches to harness NK cells to kill reactivated cells during this window, contributing to HIV-1 reservoir decline over time and prevention of viral rebound. Approaches that enhance NK cell function include cytokine treatments, blocking of inhibitory receptors and targeting to sanctuary sites. In addition, bNAb and bispecific antibody therapies that improve NK cell-mediated ADCC and gene-modified NK cell transfusions represent promising HIV-specific therapies. Lastly, NK cells can control T cell activation, influencing adaptive immune responses and thereby potentially limiting the number of available cells vulnerable to HIV reservoir re-seeding.

While the frequency of cytotoxic NK cells decreases, a highly impaired NK cell subset expands in response to persistent viremia [19\u201321]. NK cell activation and dysfunction remain even under effective ART with undetectable viral load [18,22,23]. Expression of PD-1 on NK cells during chronic HIV-1 infection hints at exhaustion of these cells that persists in ART-treated individuals [24]. To leverage NK cells for killing reservoir cells, efforts are directed towards reversing NK cell inhibition and improving their cytotoxic function. Astorga-Gamaza et al. identified a functionally impaired NK cell population expressing the inhibitory receptor KLRG1 whose expression positively correlated with viral transcription in treated HIV infection [25]. Anti-KLRG1 antibodies enhanced the killing capacity of NK cells and in parallel induced viral reactivation in latently infected CD4+ T cells given that KLRG1 is enriched in cells harboring intact provirus [26]. Another inhibitory receptor, TIGIT, is upregulated on NK cells of people with HIV (PWH) and can suppress NK cell function [27]. Wang et al. recently demonstrated the positive correlation of TIGIT expression on NK cells with reservoir size and uncovered the mechanism for TIGIT-mediated decrease of interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) production in NK cells [28\u25aa].

In this model, we summarize approaches to harness NK cells to kill reactivated cells during this window, contributing to HIV-1 reservoir decline over time and prevention of viral rebound. Approaches that enhance NK cell function include cytokine treatments, blocking of inhibitory receptors and targeting to sanctuary sites. In addition, bNAb and bispecific antibody therapies that improve NK cell-mediated ADCC and gene-modified NK cell transfusions represent promising HIV-specific therapies.

Although the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has increased life expectancy significantly [2] it does not result in a cure. Implications include life-long adherence to ART and drug-related toxicities [3]. Intensive research into HIV prevention has not yet resulted in an approved HIV vaccine [4]. This emphasizes the need for a functional cure which aims to control HIV replication without ART. Latently HIV-1-infected cells harbor replication-competent provirus that can reactivate upon ART cessation, which presents the main obstacle to HIV-1 cure. Davenport et al. outlined two main strategies to induce a functional cure: decreasing the frequency of successful HIV reactivation events to delay the time to rebound, and promoting post-rebound viral control by removing susceptible HIV targets and enhancing host immune control [5]. Natural killer (NK) cells, as innate effector cells, may especially contribute to surveilling reactivating reservoir cells (Fig. 1). Evidence for the importance of NK cells in control of HIV infection comes from studies associating the genetic presence of specific NK cell receptors and certain HLA alleles with delayed progression to AIDS [6,7] and NK cell driven viral evolution [8]. In addition, the HIV vaccine trial RV144, which was the only trial to show moderate success, demonstrated a positive correlation between one of the main NK cell effector functions, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and protection against HIV infection [9,10]. There are a number of excellent articles reviewing the role of NK cells and innate immunity in HIV infection [11\u201314] and approaches to developing a cure [15\u201317]. Therefore, this review will focus on exciting new advancements and promising NK cell strategies targeting the viral reservoir.\nStrategies to harness innate immune surveillance of reactivation events.

The award supports a $250,000 cash prize annually for up to three scientists or researchers whose work best underpins the Science Breakthrough of the Year, the journal\u2019s choice of the top research advance of the year. In 2024, Science named lenacapavir the latest Breakthrough.\nSundquist, who moved to the University of Utah as an assistant professor in 1992, played a key role in the development of the drug, though his work was not immediately recognized. \u201cSundquist spent countless hours in the lab, made a critical discovery, and then watched it sit on the shelf for a while, which can happen in basic science,\u201d said Ranney.\nHis contribution \u2014 which he embarked upon as he started his Utah-based lab \u2014 was elucidating the structure and functions of the HIV virus\u2019s capsid protein. Sundquist focused on the capsid because he was aware that HIV deaths were increasing globally and that most scientists studying HIV treatments were looking at the virus\u2019s enzymes. \u201cWe wanted to work on an aspect of the problem that was unique,\u201d he said, \u201cand we were drawn to the unusual cone-shape of the capsid.\u201d\nUntil Sundquist\u2019s work, scientists thought the capsid, which encloses the virus\u2019s genetic material, was largely a structural element. They did not see it as a particularly \u201cdruggable\u201d target, especially compared to enzymes, in part because it was thought to be highly stable.\nIn 1996, working with a team, Sundquist published a paper in Science that defined the capsid\u2019s architecture. That laid the groundwork for a study in 2003 in the Journal of Virology, in which he and colleagues showed that if the HIV capsid was disrupted, even in minor ways, viral replication was disrupted too.\n\u201cThat was unexpected,\u201d said Sundquist.\nEven as these critical discoveries were made, however, it wasn\u2019t obvious that the capsid would be easily turned into a drug target. For his part, though, Sundquist didn\u2019t feel it was very long after he and his colleagues published their 2003 results that Gilead Sciences contacted them.\nTomas Cihl\u00e1\u0159, a virologist at the company, visited Sundquist\u2019s labs. Impressed with his discoveries, Cihl\u00e1\u0159 took them back to his colleagues. The Gilead team wanted to see if they could use Sundquist\u2019s insights about how to hinder viral replication to design HIV drugs with longer acting power for people living with HIV; while the standard of care treatment \u2014 combination antiretroviral therapy \u2014 worked well, it required daily medication.\nA dedicated group of scientists at Gilead Sciences showed perseverance as it took more than a decade (beginning around 2006) to develop a drug based on Sundquist\u2019s findings. To do so, John Link, then-vice president of Medicinal Chemistry at Gilead, and his colleagues screened thousands of molecules to identify an effective capsid inhibitor.\n\u201cWe sometimes think about industry as not having staying power,\u201d said Ranney. \u201cBut it was something like 15 years here \u2014 fits and starts \u2014\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

OHSU just won $8.4 million to decode their cells for a cure.\n\nFull Page Content:\nStorage Preferences\nIn the hunt for a remedy, when the baton is passed from dedicated academic scientists to an innovative company to trusted community advocates, outcomes for society can be especially powerful.\nToday, thanks to that sequence of contributions, the first HIV drug to offer long-lasting protection from infection \u2014 eliminating the need for people to take a daily pill \u2014 exists. For their role in ensuring that drug, lenacapavir, came to life and to market, the AAAS Mani L. Bhaumik Breakthrough of the Year Award is being awarded to Wesley Sundquist, chair of the University of Utah Department of Biochemistry; Moupali Das, vice president, Clinical Development, HIV Prevention & Pediatrics at Gilead Sciences; and Yvette Raphael, co-founder and executive director of Advocacy for Prevention of HIV in Africa .\n\u201cThese individuals represent the three arms of what is necessary to create new science and then translate it for the world in a way that is really able to make a difference,\u201d said Megan Ranney, dean of the Yale School of Public Health and part of the committee \u2014 convened by Science journals\u2019 Editor-in-Chief Holden Thorp \u2014 that selected the winners.\n\u201cI was excited about how these three tell the story of the journey required to bring a drug into existence,\u201d said committee member William Powderly, co-director of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Washington University School of Medicine. \u201cIt takes multiple people, skillsets and partners.\u201d\nAs of 2023, 39.9 million people globally were living with HIV, newly infecting more than 1 million people a year.\nEven after decades of research, there is no cure for the disease HIV causes, AIDS. But lenacapavir, born out of research on HIV\u2019s cone-shaped capsid protein, gets close, almost completely preventing new HIV infections from occurring. The drug protects people for six months with each shot.\n\u201cThis drug is extraordinary \u2014 the closest thing to a vaccine that we have,\u201d said Ranney. She explained that she and many of her peers in the public health community entered the field at the height of the AIDS pandemic, in the 1980s and 1990s. \u201cThis medication is beyond the wildest dreams of what many of us could have imagined.\u201d\nRecognizing the people behind such significant scientific developments is a central philosophy for donor Mani L. Bhaumik, Ph.D. \u2014 a physicist with myriad contributions to the development of high-powered lasers \u2014 as well as for AAAS and the Science family of journals.\n\u201cStudying intractable parts of the physical world, like a virus capsid, is critical to scientific innovation,\u201d said Bhaumik. \u201cAnd persisting to ensure that insights from basic research insight can be applied and that they are trusted by those who they will serve is critical \u2014 now more than ever. I\u2019m delighted to see this year\u2019s recognition go to people across sectors whose thorough approach made such a valuable contribution.\u201d\nThe Mani L. Bhaumik Breakthrough of the Year Award was established in 2022 with a $11.4 million pledge from Bhaumik: the largest in the organization\u2019s history. The award supports a $250,000 cash prize annually for up to three scientists or researchers whose work best underpins the Science Breakthrough of the Year, the journal\u2019s choice of the top research advance of the year. In 2024, Science named lenacapavir the latest Breakthrough.\nSundquist, who moved to the University of Utah as an assistant professor in 1992, played a key role in the development of the drug, though his work was not immediately recognized. \u201cSundquist spent countless hours in the lab, made a critical discovery, and then watched it sit on the shelf for a while, which can happen in basic science,\u201d said Ranney.\nHis contribution \u2014 which he embarked upon as he started his Utah-based lab \u2014 was elucidating the structure and functions of the HIV virus\u2019s capsid protein. Sundquist focused on the capsid because he was aware that HIV deaths were increasing globally and that most scientists studying HIV treatments were looking at the virus\u2019s enzymes. \u201cWe wanted to work on an aspect of the problem that was unique,\u201d he said, \u201cand we were drawn to the unusual cone-shape of the capsid.\u201d\nUntil Sundquist\u2019s work, scientists thought the capsid, which encloses the virus\u2019s genetic material, was largely a structural element. They did not see it as a particularly \u201cdruggable\u201d target, especially compared to enzymes, in part because it was thought to be highly stable.\nIn 1996, working with a team, Sundquist published a paper in Science that defined the capsid\u2019s architecture. That laid the groundwork for a study in 2003 in the Journal of Virology, in which he and colleagues showed that if the HIV capsid was disrupted, even in minor ways, viral replication was disrupted too.\n\u201cThat was unexpected,\u201d said Sundquist.\nEven as these critical discoveries were made, however, it wasn\u2019t obvious that the capsid would be easily turned into a drug target. For his part, though, Sundquist didn\u2019t feel it was very long after he and his colleagues published their 2003 results that Gilead Sciences contacted them.\nTomas Cihl\u00e1\u0159, a virologist at the company, visited Sundquist\u2019s labs.

NK cells respond to inflammatory signals at an early stage of virus infection, resulting in proliferation, cytokine production, and cytolytic activity that can reduce virus loads. Moreover, the rapid kinetics of the NK cell response enables NK cells to influence other populations of innate immune cells, affect the inflammatory milieu, and guide adaptive immune responses to infection. Early NK cell interactions with other leukocytes can have long-lasting effects on the number and quality of memory T cells, as well as impact the exhaustion of T cells during chronic infections. The ability of NK cells to modulate T cell responses can be mediated through direct T-NK interactions, cytokine production, or indirectly through dendritic cells and other cell types. Herein, we summarize our current understanding of how NK cells interact with T cells, dendritic cells, B cells, and other cell types involved in adaptive immune responses to virus infection. We outline several mechanisms by which NK cells enhance or suppress adaptive immune response and long-lived immunological memory.\nKeywords: innate immunity, adaptive immunity, T cell memory, cytokines\nNatural killer cells play an important role in immune defense against virus infections and cancer through their cytolytic activity and production of cytokines.1\u20134 NK cells can respond to inflammation and recognize molecular cues on certain target cells, thereby facilitating the production of IFN-\u03b3 or the direct cytolysis of those target cells to suppress virus replication.5 Targets of NK cell cytolysis, including infected cells, are usually distinguished by reduced expression of MHC-related ligands for NK cell inhibitory receptors and elevated expression of pathogen-derived or stress-activated host ligands for NK cell activating receptors.6 Infected cells can also be recognized and lysed indirectly by NK cells through a phenomenon termed antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), wherein antigens on the target cells are bound by virus-specific antibodies that subsequently engage Fc receptors on the NK cell. In addition to direct control of virus replication, NK cells have been implicated in modulating other aspects of the host antiviral response.\nNK cells are typically identified by their surface expression of NK1.1 and NKp46 (in mice) or CD56 (in humans). However, there are numerous molecules that are expressed on NK cells that influence their functions and can be used to follow their activation state after infection. NK cells develop in the bone marrow and seed the peripheral compartments, which include the blood, secondary lymphoid organs, non-lymphoid organs, thymus, and mucosal sites.7\u20139 In the homeostatic state, NK cells are abundant (~5% of splenocytes in mouse; 5%\u201320% of peripheral blood leukocytes in healthy people), and they are capable of proliferating under inflammatory conditions. Mature NK cells are heterogeneous in terms of surface receptor expression in mice and in humans.7,10,11 Part of this variation is due to genetic and epigenetic variation in germline-encoded activating and inhibitory receptor expression. Other variation is due to environmental influences, such as recent infection. A recent analysis of human NK cell diversity in the peripheral blood used mass cytometry, or cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF), to simultaneously survey 28 NK cell receptors in different individuals.11 That study showed that there are 6000\u201330,000 phenotypic populations of NK cells within an individual and > 100,000 phenotypes across individuals. Based on a comparative analysis of NK cells in monozygotic twins compared to unrelated donors, it was concluded that inhibitory receptor expression was primarily driven by genetics whereas environmental factors regulate activation receptor expression.11 These differences likely contribute to functional heterogeneity among NK cells in mice and man.10 For example, tissue resident NK cells differ phenotypically\u2014and probably differ functionally\u2014from NK cells in lymphoid organs or in circulation.12 This variation likely affects immune defense. NK cells in mucosal sites are a first line of defense against infections and are also involved in recruiting other cell types to those sites of infection. 13\u201315 It is plausible that NK cells residing in each tissue have dedicated functions involved in limiting infection, inducing protective immune responses, dampening potentially harmful immune responses, or tissue repair.\nHistorically, NK cells have been regarded as integral components of immune-mediated elimination of infected, damaged, or transformed cells.

Diagnosis and staging were based on the 2014 US surveillance case definition for HIV infection. We divided early HIV-1 infection (stage 0) into two subcategories. Subcategory 0\u03b1: a negative or indeterminate HIV-1 antibody test was \u226460 days after the first confirmed positive HIV-1 test or a negative or indeterminate antibody test or qualitative HIV-1 nucleic acid test (NAT) was \u2264180 days before the first positive test, the latter being a NAT or detectable viral load. Subcategory 0\u03b2: a negative or indeterminate antibody or qualitative NAT was \u2264180 days before the first positive test, the latter being an HIV antibody or antigen/antibody test. We compared median earliest viral loads for each stage and subcategory in each of the first 6 weeks after diagnosis using only the earliest viral load for each individual.\nOf 203,392 infections, 56.69% (115,297/203,392) were reported with a quantified earliest viral load within 6 weeks after diagnosis and criteria sufficient to determine the stage at diagnosis. Among 5081 infections at stage 0, the median earliest viral load fell from 694,000 copies/mL in week 1 to 125,022 in week 2 and 43,473 by week 6. Among 30,910 infections in stage 1, the median earliest viral load ranged 15,412-17,495. Among 42,784 infections in stage 2, the median viral load declined from 44,973 in week 1 to 38,497 in week 6. Among 36,522 infections in stage 3 (AIDS), the median viral load dropped from 205,862 in week 1 to 119,000 in week 6. The median earliest viral load in stage 0 subcategory 0\u03b1 fell from 1,344,590 copies/mL in week 1 to 362,467 in week 2 and 47,320 in week 6, while that in subcategory 0\u03b2 was 70,114 copies/mL in week 1 and then 32,033 to 44,067 in weeks 2-6. The median viral load in subcategory 0\u03b1 was higher than that in subcategory 0\u03b2 in each of the first 6 weeks after diagnosis (P<.001).\nIn the 1st week after diagnosis, viral loads in early infections are generally several times higher than those in later stages at diagnosis. By the 3rd week, however, most are lower than those in stage 3. High viral loads in early infection are much more common in subcategory 0\u03b1 than in subcategory 0\u03b2, consistent with 0\u03b1 comprising mostly acute infections and 0\u03b2 comprising mostly postacute early infections. These findings may inform the prioritization of interventions for prevention.\nKeywords: acute HIV infection, early HIV infection, primary HIV infection, HIV testing, viral load\nThe 2014 revision of the US surveillance case definition for HIV infection added \u201cstage 0\u201d to its staging system to represent early infection (assumed to last about 6 months after the start of infection). HIV infections are classified in stage 0 if they have evidence of being early\u2014negative or indeterminate HIV test results near the time of diagnosis. Otherwise, they are classified in the later stages\u20141, 2, or 3 (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]) [1]. Prompt recognition of infections in stage 0 can provide a critical opportunity to prevent transmission of HIV infection during acute (or primary) infection (part of stage 0). Acute infection is often associated with very high viral loads [2-7], which increase the risk of transmission [8]. Intervention would include antiretroviral treatment to suppress the viral load and the provision of \u201cpartner services,\u201d in which public health workers interview the patient to identify sex or needle-sharing partners in the past 12 months; locate the partners; and offer them HIV testing, counseling, and linkage to care, as appropriate [9,10]. If infected, such partners may also have early infection.\nThis analysis was intended to document the high viral loads that justify giving priority to stage 0 infections for intervention to prevent transmission. For that purpose, we compared median earliest viral loads by week in the first 6 weeks after diagnosis for each stage (0, 1, 2, or 3). Another objective was to demonstrate how HIV surveillance data could be used to distinguish between acute infections and other early HIV infections in stage 0, as the highest priority for intervention should be given to acute infections (expected to have the highest viral loads) rather than given equally to postacute early infections (with lower viral loads). To do that, we defined subcategories of stage 0 that approximate acute infection and postacute early infection and compared median viral loads among these two subcategories.\nWe used data for the 203,392 HIV infections diagnosed during 2012-2016 and reported to the National HIV Surveillance System (NHSS) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention through December 2017 from the 50 US states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands. In the software of the NHSS database, the stage at diagnosis can be automatically classified as stage 0 only for HIV infections diagnosed in or after 2014, when the definition of stage 0 was published [1]. For this analysis, however, we retroactively extended the application of the definition of stage 0 to infections diagnosed in 2012 and 2013 to increase the number of stage 0 diagnoses available for analysis.\nWe excluded the 24.03% (48,880/203,392) of infections for which the stage at diagnosis could not be determined.

NK cells respond to inflammatory signals at an early stage of virus infection, resulting in proliferation, cytokine production, and cytolytic activity that can reduce virus loads. Moreover, the rapid kinetics of the NK cell response enables NK cells to influence other populations of innate immune cells, affect the inflammatory milieu, and guide adaptive immune responses to infection. Early NK cell interactions with other leukocytes can have long-lasting effects on the number and quality of memory T cells, as well as impact the exhaustion of T cells during chronic infections. The ability of NK cells to modulate T cell responses can be mediated through direct T-NK interactions, cytokine production, or indirectly through dendritic cells and other cell types. Herein, we summarize our current understanding of how NK cells interact with T cells, dendritic cells, B cells, and other cell types involved in adaptive immune responses to virus infection. We outline several mechanisms by which NK cells enhance or suppress adaptive immune response and long-lived immunological memory.\nKeywords: innate immunity, adaptive immunity, T cell memory, cytokines\nNatural killer cells play an important role in immune defense against virus infections and cancer through their cytolytic activity and production of cytokines.1\u20134 NK cells can respond to inflammation and recognize molecular cues on certain target cells, thereby facilitating the production of IFN-\u03b3 or the direct cytolysis of those target cells to suppress virus replication.5 Targets of NK cell cytolysis, including infected cells, are usually distinguished by reduced expression of MHC-related ligands for NK cell inhibitory receptors and elevated expression of pathogen-derived or stress-activated host ligands for NK cell activating receptors.6 Infected cells can also be recognized and lysed indirectly by NK cells through a phenomenon termed antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), wherein antigens on the target cells are bound by virus-specific antibodies that subsequently engage Fc receptors on the NK cell. In addition to direct control of virus replication, NK cells have been implicated in modulating other aspects of the host antiviral response.\nNK cells are typically identified by their surface expression of NK1.1 and NKp46 (in mice) or CD56 (in humans). However, there are numerous molecules that are expressed on NK cells that influence their functions and can be used to follow their activation state after infection. NK cells develop in the bone marrow and seed the peripheral compartments, which include the blood, secondary lymphoid organs, non-lymphoid organs, thymus, and mucosal sites.7\u20139 In the homeostatic state, NK cells are abundant (~5% of splenocytes in mouse; 5%\u201320% of peripheral blood leukocytes in healthy people), and they are capable of proliferating under inflammatory conditions. Mature NK cells are heterogeneous in terms of surface receptor expression in mice and in humans.7,10,11 Part of this variation is due to genetic and epigenetic variation in germline-encoded activating and inhibitory receptor expression. Other variation is due to environmental influences, such as recent infection. A recent analysis of human NK cell diversity in the peripheral blood used mass cytometry, or cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF), to simultaneously survey 28 NK cell receptors in different individuals.11 That study showed that there are 6000\u201330,000 phenotypic populations of NK cells within an individual and > 100,000 phenotypes across individuals. Based on a comparative analysis of NK cells in monozygotic twins compared to unrelated donors, it was concluded that inhibitory receptor expression was primarily driven by genetics whereas environmental factors regulate activation receptor expression.11 These differences likely contribute to functional heterogeneity among NK cells in mice and man.10 For example, tissue resident NK cells differ phenotypically\u2014and probably differ functionally\u2014from NK cells in lymphoid organs or in circulation.12 This variation likely affects immune defense. NK cells in mucosal sites are a first line of defense against infections and are also involved in recruiting other cell types to those sites of infection. 13\u201315 It is plausible that NK cells residing in each tissue have dedicated functions involved in limiting infection, inducing protective immune responses, dampening potentially harmful immune responses, or tissue repair.\nHistorically, NK cells have been regarded as integral components of immune-mediated elimination of infected, damaged, or transformed cells.

We compared median earliest viral loads for each stage and subcategory in each of the first 6 weeks after diagnosis using only the earliest viral load for each individual.\nOf 203,392 infections, 56.69% (115,297/203,392) were reported with a quantified earliest viral load within 6 weeks after diagnosis and criteria sufficient to determine the stage at diagnosis. Among 5081 infections at stage 0, the median earliest viral load fell from 694,000 copies/mL in week 1 to 125,022 in week 2 and 43,473 by week 6.

The median viral load in subcategory 0\u03b1 was higher than that in subcategory 0\u03b2 in each of the first 6 weeks after diagnosis (P<.001).\nIn the 1st week after diagnosis, viral loads in early infections are generally several times higher than those in later stages at diagnosis. By the 3rd week, however, most are lower than those in stage 3.

Otherwise, they are classified in the later stages\u20141, 2, or 3 (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]) [1]. Prompt recognition of infections in stage 0 can provide a critical opportunity to prevent transmission of HIV infection during acute (or primary) infection (part of stage 0). Acute infection is often associated with very high viral loads [2-7], which increase the risk of transmission [8]. Intervention would include antiretroviral treatment to suppress the viral load and the provision of \u201cpartner services,\u201d in which public health workers interview the patient to identify sex or needle-sharing partners in the past 12 months; locate the partners; and offer them HIV testing, counseling, and linkage to care, as appropriate [9,10]. If infected, such partners may also have early infection.\nThis analysis was intended to document the high viral loads that justify giving priority to stage 0 infections for intervention to prevent transmission. For that purpose, we compared median earliest viral loads by week in the first 6 weeks after diagnosis for each stage (0, 1, 2, or 3). Another objective was to demonstrate how HIV surveillance data could be used to distinguish between acute infections and other early HIV infections in stage 0, as the highest priority for intervention should be given to acute infections (expected to have the highest viral loads) rather than given equally to postacute early infections (with lower viral loads).

Diagnosis and staging were based on the 2014 US surveillance case definition for HIV infection. We divided early HIV-1 infection (stage 0) into two subcategories. Subcategory 0\u03b1: a negative or indeterminate HIV-1 antibody test was \u226460 days after the first confirmed positive HIV-1 test or a negative or indeterminate antibody test or qualitative HIV-1 nucleic acid test (NAT) was \u2264180 days before the first positive test, the latter being a NAT or detectable viral load. Subcategory 0\u03b2: a negative or indeterminate antibody or qualitative NAT was \u2264180 days before the first positive test, the latter being an HIV antibody or antigen/antibody test. We compared median earliest viral loads for each stage and subcategory in each of the first 6 weeks after diagnosis using only the earliest viral load for each individual.\nOf 203,392 infections, 56.69% (115,297/203,392) were reported with a quantified earliest viral load within 6 weeks after diagnosis and criteria sufficient to determine the stage at diagnosis. Among 5081 infections at stage 0, the median earliest viral load fell from 694,000 copies/mL in week 1 to 125,022 in week 2 and 43,473 by week 6. Among 30,910 infections in stage 1, the median earliest viral load ranged 15,412-17,495. Among 42,784 infections in stage 2, the median viral load declined from 44,973 in week 1 to 38,497 in week 6. Among 36,522 infections in stage 3 (AIDS), the median viral load dropped from 205,862 in week 1 to 119,000 in week 6. The median earliest viral load in stage 0 subcategory 0\u03b1 fell from 1,344,590 copies/mL in week 1 to 362,467 in week 2 and 47,320 in week 6, while that in subcategory 0\u03b2 was 70,114 copies/mL in week 1 and then 32,033 to 44,067 in weeks 2-6. The median viral load in subcategory 0\u03b1 was higher than that in subcategory 0\u03b2 in each of the first 6 weeks after diagnosis (P<.001).\nIn the 1st week after diagnosis, viral loads in early infections are generally several times higher than those in later stages at diagnosis. By the 3rd week, however, most are lower than those in stage 3. High viral loads in early infection are much more common in subcategory 0\u03b1 than in subcategory 0\u03b2, consistent with 0\u03b1 comprising mostly acute infections and 0\u03b2 comprising mostly postacute early infections. These findings may inform the prioritization of interventions for prevention.\nKeywords: acute HIV infection, early HIV infection, primary HIV infection, HIV testing, viral load\nThe 2014 revision of the US surveillance case definition for HIV infection added \u201cstage 0\u201d to its staging system to represent early infection (assumed to last about 6 months after the start of infection). HIV infections are classified in stage 0 if they have evidence of being early\u2014negative or indeterminate HIV test results near the time of diagnosis. Otherwise, they are classified in the later stages\u20141, 2, or 3 (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]) [1]. Prompt recognition of infections in stage 0 can provide a critical opportunity to prevent transmission of HIV infection during acute (or primary) infection (part of stage 0). Acute infection is often associated with very high viral loads [2-7], which increase the risk of transmission [8]. Intervention would include antiretroviral treatment to suppress the viral load and the provision of \u201cpartner services,\u201d in which public health workers interview the patient to identify sex or needle-sharing partners in the past 12 months; locate the partners; and offer them HIV testing, counseling, and linkage to care, as appropriate [9,10]. If infected, such partners may also have early infection.\nThis analysis was intended to document the high viral loads that justify giving priority to stage 0 infections for intervention to prevent transmission. For that purpose, we compared median earliest viral loads by week in the first 6 weeks after diagnosis for each stage (0, 1, 2, or 3). Another objective was to demonstrate how HIV surveillance data could be used to distinguish between acute infections and other early HIV infections in stage 0, as the highest priority for intervention should be given to acute infections (expected to have the highest viral loads) rather than given equally to postacute early infections (with lower viral loads). To do that, we defined subcategories of stage 0 that approximate acute infection and postacute early infection and compared median viral loads among these two subcategories.\nWe used data for the 203,392 HIV infections diagnosed during 2012-2016 and reported to the National HIV Surveillance System (NHSS) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention through December 2017 from the 50 US states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands. In the software of the NHSS database, the stage at diagnosis can be automatically classified as stage 0 only for HIV infections diagnosed in or after 2014, when the definition of stage 0 was published [1]. For this analysis, however, we retroactively extended the application of the definition of stage 0 to infections diagnosed in 2012 and 2013 to increase the number of stage 0 diagnoses available for analysis.\nWe excluded the 24.03% (48,880/203,392) of infections for which the stage at diagnosis could not be determined. Their reported data did not include the negative or indeterminate HIV test results required to meet the criteria for stage 0 nor a CD4 T-lymphocyte test result or opportunistic illness diagnosis required to meet the criteria for stage 1, 2, or 3 within 3 months after diagnosis.\nWe assumed that specimens for earliest viral loads would general\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

HIV infects and destroys immune cells called CD4 T cells or T helper cells. Overtime the number of your immune cells will decrease as they are killed by the virus, which leads to AIDS. AIDS is when your immune system is significantly weakened by the virus, and you start to experience complications of a weakened immune system. Today, HIV treatment is highly effective at preventing HIV infection from progressing to AIDS and allowing people living with HIV to lead long lives.\nGlobally: In 2024, 40.8 million people worldwide were living with HIV and 1.3 million new people became infected with the virus.\nUS incidence: In 2024, 1.2 million people in the US were living with HIV and 31,800 new people became infected with the virus.\nSince the beginning of the HIV epidemic in 1981, 91.4 million people have been infected with the virus and 44.1 million have died from HIV-related causes.\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus that infects and destroys immune cells. HIV spreads through contact with bodily fluids including blood, semen, vaginal fluids, and breastmilk. This means HIV can spread through activities such as unprotected sex, sharing needles or syringes, or from mother to baby.\nOnce HIV enters the body, it infects T helper cells (also known as CD4 T cells). When HIV enters a T helper cell, it permanently inserts its viral DNA into the cell\u2019s DNA. The virus has now hijacked the T helper cell, using it to make more copies of the virus. The viral DNA from HIV also becomes permanently part of an infected T helper cell\u2019s DNA. This makes it very difficult for the immune system to find and kill the virus. Because of HIV\u2019s ability to quickly hide within your cells and because it mutates very often, developing a vaccine to prevent HIV is very challenging.\nThe first stage of HIV infection is called acute HIV. This is when someone is first infected with HIV and may experience mild flu-like symptoms or no symptoms at all. This can then progress to chronic infection where HIV will continue to replicate inside T helper cells, slowly killing them and infecting more cells. At this stage, it\u2019s likely that the infected person won\u2019t experience any noticeable symptoms. During this time, they can still transmit HIV, even if they don\u2019t realize they have it.\nHIV infection can affect anyone. To learn more or be tested for the virus, talk to a doctor or visit a local health clinic.\nThe final stage of HIV infection is acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). This is when the number of T helper cells becomes very low. This happens years after initial infection and the immune system has been severely weakened by the virus. The T helper cells that HIV infects and destroys are crucial for activating other immune cells to coordinate an immune response. As the number of T helper cells decreases, the immune system becomes weaker, unable to fight off simple infections or prevent the development of cancer.\nA person with AIDS is more likely to get opportunistic infections, which are infections a healthy immune system could normally prevent. They are also more likely to develop certain types of cancer. These infections and cancers are called AIDS-defining illnesses. They occur because the T helper cells that are supposed to help initiate immune responses are too weak to respond. Some examples include Kaposi sarcoma, tuberculosis, or chronic herpes ulcers.\nHIV treatment and prevention have come a long way, but there is no cure. Today, HIV treatment can prevent HIV infection from progressing to AIDS. When taking HIV treatment as prescribed, many people live long lives. Treatment can even reduce HIV to undetectable levels in person, meaning there is so little virus active in your blood that a test cannot detect it. This doesn\u2019t mean you are cured, but it does mean your treatment is working very effectively. Researchers have even determined that when HIV levels are undetectable and stay undetectable, the virus cannot be transmitted. Immunology research over the last 40 years contributed to these major advancements in HIV treatment that allow people to live decades with little to no symptoms of HIV infection.\nImmunology research is continuing to advance HIV treatments and even help find a cure for the infection. Immunotherapy, treatment that enhances the immune system\u2019s ability to fight disease, is providing promise for people with HIV. A study in 2022, found that a cancer immunotherapy, pembrolizumab, can reverse HIV\u2019s ability to hide in immune cells. The virus\u2019s ability to hide is a major barrier to curing HIV, and immunotherapies like this may be a key step in reaching a cure.\nmRNA vaccines are also showing incredible promise in curing HIV. One study found that mRNA can be delivered to the cells where HIV is hiding and provide instructions to the cell that reveal the virus. Being able to reveal the virus and prevent it from hiding can lead to drugs that permanently eliminate HIV from the body. Another study using mRNA vaccines, successfully trained the immune system to recognize and fight HIV, a major battle in developing successful HIV vaccines.

HIV infects and destroys immune cells called CD4 T cells or T helper cells. Overtime the number of your immune cells will decrease as they are killed by the virus, which leads to AIDS. AIDS is when your immune system is significantly weakened by the virus, and you start to experience complications of a weakened immune system. Today, HIV treatment is highly effective at preventing HIV infection from progressing to AIDS and allowing people living with HIV to lead long lives.\nGlobally: In 2024, 40.8 million people worldwide were living with HIV and 1.3 million new people became infected with the virus.\nUS incidence: In 2024, 1.2 million people in the US were living with HIV and 31,800 new people became infected with the virus.\nSince the beginning of the HIV epidemic in 1981, 91.4 million people have been infected with the virus and 44.1 million have died from HIV-related causes.\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus that infects and destroys immune cells. HIV spreads through contact with bodily fluids including blood, semen, vaginal fluids, and breastmilk. This means HIV can spread through activities such as unprotected sex, sharing needles or syringes, or from mother to baby.\nOnce HIV enters the body, it infects T helper cells (also known as CD4 T cells). When HIV enters a T helper cell, it permanently inserts its viral DNA into the cell\u2019s DNA. The virus has now hijacked the T helper cell, using it to make more copies of the virus. The viral DNA from HIV also becomes permanently part of an infected T helper cell\u2019s DNA. This makes it very difficult for the immune system to find and kill the virus. Because of HIV\u2019s ability to quickly hide within your cells and because it mutates very often, developing a vaccine to prevent HIV is very challenging.\nThe first stage of HIV infection is called acute HIV. This is when someone is first infected with HIV and may experience mild flu-like symptoms or no symptoms at all. This can then progress to chronic infection where HIV will continue to replicate inside T helper cells, slowly killing them and infecting more cells. At this stage, it\u2019s likely that the infected person won\u2019t experience any noticeable symptoms. During this time, they can still transmit HIV, even if they don\u2019t realize they have it.\nHIV infection can affect anyone. To learn more or be tested for the virus, talk to a doctor or visit a local health clinic.\nThe final stage of HIV infection is acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). This is when the number of T helper cells becomes very low. This happens years after initial infection and the immune system has been severely weakened by the virus. The T helper cells that HIV infects and destroys are crucial for activating other immune cells to coordinate an immune response. As the number of T helper cells decreases, the immune system becomes weaker, unable to fight off simple infections or prevent the development of cancer.\nA person with AIDS is more likely to get opportunistic infections, which are infections a healthy immune system could normally prevent. They are also more likely to develop certain types of cancer. These infections and cancers are called AIDS-defining illnesses. They occur because the T helper cells that are supposed to help initiate immune responses are too weak to respond. Some examples include Kaposi sarcoma, tuberculosis, or chronic herpes ulcers.\nHIV treatment and prevention have come a long way, but there is no cure. Today, HIV treatment can prevent HIV infection from progressing to AIDS. When taking HIV treatment as prescribed, many people live long lives. Treatment can even reduce HIV to undetectable levels in person, meaning there is so little virus active in your blood that a test cannot detect it. This doesn\u2019t mean you are cured, but it does mean your treatment is working very effectively. Researchers have even determined that when HIV levels are undetectable and stay undetectable, the virus cannot be transmitted. Immunology research over the last 40 years contributed to these major advancements in HIV treatment that allow people to live decades with little to no symptoms of HIV infection.\nImmunology research is continuing to advance HIV treatments and even help find a cure for the infection. Immunotherapy, treatment that enhances the immune system\u2019s ability to fight disease, is providing promise for people with HIV. A study in 2022, found that a cancer immunotherapy, pembrolizumab, can reverse HIV\u2019s ability to hide in immune cells. The virus\u2019s ability to hide is a major barrier to curing HIV, and immunotherapies like this may be a key step in reaching a cure.\nmRNA vaccines are also showing incredible promise in curing HIV. One study found that mRNA can be delivered to the cells where HIV is hiding and provide instructions to the cell that reveal the virus. Being able to reveal the virus and prevent it from hiding can lead to drugs that permanently eliminate HIV from the body. Another study using mRNA vaccines, successfully trained the immune system to recognize and fight HIV, a major battle in developing successful HIV vaccines. With continued advances in immunology and personalized medicine, researchers hope new technology like mRNA vaccines and immunotherpay will finally lead to a cure for HIV.\nThe American Association of Immunologists (\u201cAAI\u201d) websites (www.aai.org, www.immunologyexplained.org, and all related webpages, the \u201cWebsites\u201d) include information meant to inform visitors (\u201cUsers\u201d) about immunology and its related disciplines.

The study also revealed that individuals with late-stage HIV infection also have high viral loads in their semen, and the investigators believe that their findings confirm earlier suggestions that individuals recently infected with HIV as well as those with advanced HIV disease, are particularly infectious and are driving the spread of HIV.\nIt is estimated that 80% of all HIV infections are acquired sexually. The transmission of HIV depends upon the infectiousness of the host and the susceptibility of the sexual partner, and both infectiousness and susceptibility can vary significantly over time.\nInfectiousness can be directly correlated with viral load in blood, and blood viral load can serve as a surrogate marker of shedding of HIV in genital secretions.\nRecent epidemiological research suggests that HIV-positive individuals are at their most infectious soon after they have become infected with the virus, a period often referred to as primary or acute HIV infection. (However a recent US researcher suggested that only 9% of HIV infections were due to individuals with primary infection. Although this model did acknowledge the high viral load present during primary infection, the short duration of primary infection and the small number of sexual contacts per individual during this time limited the contribution of individuals with acute infection to the epidemiology of HIV).\nThere have been no longitudinal studies of the dynamics of genital tract shedding of HIV during primary infection. However, investigators have recently developed a surveillance strategy that allows for the identification of individuals with primary HIV infection even before antibodies to HIV have developed. This has enabled clinicians to detect a significant number of patients with acute HIV infection in the US state of North Carolina, as well as in Malawi, South Africa, and Brazil.\nA team of investigators from North Carolina, San Francisco, and Malawi designed a study which involved men identified with acute HIV infection from a sexually transmitted infections clinic in Malawi. The investigators focused on changes in viral load in both plasma and genital secretions in men with both acute HIV infection and advanced HIV disease.\nThe study was conducted between February 2003 and October 2004 and included men attending the Lilogwe sexually transmitted diseases clinic in Malawi. All the men attending the clinic were screened for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.\nInvestigators estimated the date of primary HIV infection as occurring two weeks before the onset of symptoms of acute antiretroviral syndrome, including fever, headache and joint and muscle pain.\nOf the 951 men who attended the clinic, 370 (39%) were HIV-infected. Of these 16 (2%) were confirmed as having acute HIV infection and 345 (37%), chronic HIV infection. The investigators\u2019 prospective study included all 16 men with acute HIV infection and 25 men with chronic HIV infection. On enrolment, 44% of men with acute HIV, and 52% of those with chronic HIV, had gonorrhoea, NSU or chlamydia.\nOn entry to the study, the median duration of HIV infection for those with acute HIV was estimated to be 28 days. At the initial screening visit, blood viral load was significantly higher in men with acute HIV (1,000,000 copies/ml) than men with chronic HIV (100,000 copies/ml; p = 0.01). One week after enrolment, when semen samples were first obtained, the investigators found that although mean viral load in semen was higher in those with acute HIV infection (25,000 copies/ml), than those with chronic HIV infection (8,000 copies/ml), the difference was not statistically significant.\nThe investigators calculated that viral load peaked in the blood of acutely infected individuals 17 days after infection at well over 1,000,000 copies/ml and in semen four weeks after acquisition of HIV, at approximately 32,000 copies/ml. It then fell back steeply in both blood and semen, and by week ten was a mean of 125,000 copies/ml in blood and 1,000 copies/ml in semen, levels at which it remained stable through 28 weeks of follow-up. These changes in blood and semen viral load between peak levels and nadir levels were statistically significant (p < 0.001).\nFor patients with chronic HIV infection, the investigators found a statistically significant relationship between low CD4 cell count and high viral load in semen (p = 0.01). The investigators believe that this finding supports the theory that patients with advanced HIV disease are more infectious. They also found that each 1 log10 drop in CD4 cell count was associated with a 2 log10 increase in viral load in semen. However, peak viral load in the semen of patients with advanced HIV infection was a mean of 1.4 log10 lower than the peak observed in patients with acute HIV infection, a statistically significant difference (p = 0.0168).\n\u201cIn the current study, we found that HIV in the seminal plasma reached its peak 4 weeks after infection, and that this burst of HIV shedding was almost completely contained by week 10, most likely reflecting the host immune response\u201d, write the investigators.\nThe investigators conclude that their evidence shows that models suggesting the importance of patients with acute and advanced HIV to the continued epidemiology of HIV \u201care likely correct, and help to explain the continued spread of HIV in different kinds of populations.\u201d The investigators add, \u201cthe need for [the] development of prevention intervention(s) focused on patients in the very earliest stages of HIV infection and their exposed and at-risk sexual partners is urgent.\u201d\nPilcher CD et al.

During this ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nWithout treatment, HIV infection gets progressively worse over time as the virus destroys key components of the immune system. Prolonged exposure to untreated HIV can eventually cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\nThere is no cure for HIV, but there is good news. Treatment with HIV medicines (called antiretroviral therapy or ART) can slow or prevent HIV from progressing into more serious forms. HIV medicines help people with HIV live long, healthy lives.\nResearch shows that people who start HIV treatment early can live as long as people who do not have the virus, largely due to the advancement of HIV medicines.\nThe progression of HIV occurs in three stages over time (months and years) in people who don\u2019t receive treatment. The stages of HIV infection include:\nAcute HIV infection is the earliest stage of HIV infection, and it generally develops within 2 to 4 weeks after infection with HIV. During this time, some people have flu-like symptoms, such as fever, headache, and rash. In the acute stage of infection, HIV multiplies rapidly and spreads throughout the body, attacking and destroying the infection-fighting CD4 cells (CD4 T lymphocytes) of the immune system. During this stage, the level of HIV in the blood is very high, which greatly increases the risk of HIV transmission.\nThe second stage of HIV infection is chronic HIV infection (also called asymptomatic HIV infection or clinical latency). During this stage, HIV continues to multiply in the body but at very low levels. People with chronic HIV infection may not have any HIV-related symptoms. Without ART, chronic HIV infection usually advances to AIDS in 10 years or longer, though in some people it may advance faster. People who are taking ART may be in this stage for several decades.\nAIDS is the final, most severe stage of HIV infection, and causes severe damage to the immune system. As a result, the body cannot fight off opportunistic infections, also called AIDS-defining conditions. People with HIV are diagnosed with AIDS if they have a CD4 count of less than 200 cells/mm3 or if they have certain opportunistic infections. Once HIV progresses to the AIDS stage, a person can have a high viral load and transmit HIV to others very easily. Without treatment, people with AIDS typically survive about 3 years.\nThe image above depicts what happens in the blood of people with HIV throughout the stages of HIV infection. Without treatment, HIV slowly increases in number and attacks and destroys normal CD4 cells. A lack of CD4 cells severely limits the immune system\u2019s ability to fight off other infections.\nART is very effective at reducing viral load to undetectable levels, particularly when started as early as possible during acute infection. Research trials found that there was a 53% reduction in the risk of death or serious illness if treatment was started with a high CD4 cell count.\nPeople with chronic HIV infection may still transmit HIV to others; however, people who take ART exactly as prescribed and maintain an undetectable viral load during this stage have minimal risk of transmitting HIV to someone without HIV through sex.\nEven if someone\u2019s HIV progresses to AIDS, HIV medicines can still reduce the amount of HIV virus in the blood to undetectable levels, allowing more CD4 cells to regenerate. In turn, people taking these medicines will be less likely to acquire an opportunistic infection, despite an AIDS diagnosis.\nUltimately, virtually anyone with HIV can benefit from modern HIV medicines, regardless of what stage of HIV they are in.\nOnce a person is diagnosed with HIV, they should start ART as soon as possible. One of the main goals of ART is to reduce a person's viral load to an undetectable level. People with HIV who maintain an undetectable viral load have effectively no risk of transmitting HIV to someone without HIV during sex and should maintain relatively normal immune function.\nIn addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that having an undetectable viral load likely reduces the risk of HIV transmission through sharing of needles, syringes, or other drug injection equipment (such as cookers), but are unsure how much the risk is reduced.\nImportantly, ART is only highly effective if taken exactly as prescribed. To ensure that HIV does not progress to more advanced stages, it is important to adhere to your prescribed medication schedule. In some cases, those who do not adhere to an ART schedule can develop resistance to their HIV medicines, making them ineffective.\nSome people face challenges that make it hard to stick to a treatment plan and maintain an undetectable viral load. In this case, they should encourage their partners to take pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). PrEP is medicine that people without HIV can take to prevent HIV infection, even if they get exposed to the virus.\nThis fact sheet is based on information from the following sources:\nFrom HIV.gov:\nFrom the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):\nAlso see the HIV Source collection of HIV links and resources.\nProvided in collaboration with NIH\u2019s Office of AIDS Research.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Through a process called budding, virus particles are released from an infected cell as little blobs that protrude outward and then pinch off from the cell membrane. Once released from the host cell, the virus particles are free to move to other cells and infect them.\nThis budding process is emblematic of HIV and other viruses that are surrounded by a membrane, or envelope. Each virus particle takes a bit of cell membrane with it when it departs. By slowly denuding the immune cell of its membrane, the virus kills its host cell. When enough immune cells die, the result is immunodeficiency, or AIDS.\nFor many years, it was believed that this budding process represented a new type of cellular behavior induced by the virus\u2014as if (to use a modern analogy) your computer started sending emails without your permission. Now, researchers with NYU School of Medicine propose that HIV is co-opting a normal form of cell behavior\u2014attaching itself to an email you were sending anyway.\nIn an article published in this week\u2019s Nature, CRI postdoctoral fellow Kaushik Choudhuri, DPhil, and colleagues present evidence that HIV uses the same process that certain immune cells, called T cells, use to communicate with other immune cells.\nT cells facilitate an immune response against pathogens\u2014things like viruses or bacteria\u2014and also against cancer. Receptors located on the surface of a T cell are like the cell\u2019s \u201ceyes,\u201d allowing it to see and recognize signs of these dangerous invaders. When a T cell receptor recognizes and binds to a distinctive marker, or antigen, from a pathogen, the T cell becomes activated. Activated T cells kill infected cells directly and also signal other cells of the immune system to act, triggering an immune response.\nT cells only stay active for a brief period of time, at which point they shut down their receptors. (This shutting down is necessary to prevent autoimmunity.) The accepted process by which T cells shut down their signaling is by internalizing the T cell receptors, smuggling them back inside the cell. But new research suggests that something different is going on.\nWhat Choudhuri and colleagues have found is that immune cells also release T cell receptors (TCR) from the cell surface into the space outside the cell. Blobs of cytoplasm and membrane studded with TCRs pinch off from the cell and drift away, much like HIV particles do. They suggest that this budding serves two purposes: 1) it helps shut down an immune response; and 2) it packages up TCRs for delivery to neighboring immune cells awaiting news of invaders.\n\u201cOur discovery that TCR is shed in extracellular microvesicles suggests a radically different fate and function for TCR,\u201d says Choudhuri, who works in the lab of Dr. Michael Dustin at NYU School of Medicine. \u201cFor instance we think that these microvesicles may convey intercellular messages to partner cells.\u201d\nChoudhuri says he and his colleagues were not thinking about HIV when they began their work. Rather, they were more interested in understanding the basic structure and function of the immunological synapse\u2014the region of communication between two adjacent immune cells. It was only when they discovered that the TCR vesicle shedding process relies on the same protein machinery used in HIV budding that they suspected a link. They strengthened their case for a common mechanism by showing that HIV infection antagonizes, or competes with, the making of TCR vesicles.\nIt is a cruel irony that HIV infection appears to spread by co-opting the process by which immune cells communicate with each other. After all, the immune system is designed to protect us from invading pathogens. Communication between immune cells is necessary to keep us safe. HIV devilishly uses that same communication system to spread its deadly message from cell to cell.\nThis process may also suggest why HIV is so difficult to fully eradicate. Researchers have known for a long time that HIV infects CD4+ \u201chelper\u201d T cells, the depletion of which eviscerates the immune system and leaves the patient vulnerable to opportunistic infections. Other immune cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells also become infected but are not killed by the virus. These cells can become \u201creservoirs\u201d of virus hiding out in the body.\n\u201cDespite a lot of progress in treating and controlling HIV infection, it is clear that the virus can persist in reservoirs in the body at low levels even with highly active retroviral therapy,\u201d says Choudhuri. \u201cWe think that our results suggest a way for infected T cells to pass on the virus to these reservoirs\u2014dendritic cells and macrophages, or even other T cells\u2014especially when the infected T cells are interacting with these cells in response to an unrelated infection.\u201d\nChoudhuri\u2019s research is relevant to more than HIV/AIDS. In addition to protecting us from infectious diseases, the immune system also wages a constant battle against cancer. By providing us with basic insights into how the immune system operates, Choudhuri\u2019s work provides cancer immunologists with more tools with which to design better treatments. For example, his team is working on ways to make synthetic forms of these microvesicles that might serve to boost the immune system into fighting tumor cells.\nAnother reason this research is significant is that Choudhuri and his colleagues employed a powerful new approach to viewing cells at the ultramicroscopic level, one that marries cutting-edge light and electron microscopy techniques. \u201cWe anticipate that these techniques will unveil entirely new vistas of the cell biology of T cell activation,\u201d Choudhuri says.\nCRI has a long history of funding such basic immunological research, including research on HIV.

HIV infects and destroys immune cells called CD4 T cells or T helper cells. Overtime the number of your immune cells will decrease as they are killed by the virus, which leads to AIDS. AIDS is when your immune system is significantly weakened by the virus, and you start to experience complications of a weakened immune system. Today, HIV treatment is highly effective at preventing HIV infection from progressing to AIDS and allowing people living with HIV to lead long lives.\nGlobally: In 2024, 40.8 million people worldwide were living with HIV and 1.3 million new people became infected with the virus.\nUS incidence: In 2024, 1.2 million people in the US were living with HIV and 31,800 new people became infected with the virus.\nSince the beginning of the HIV epidemic in 1981, 91.4 million people have been infected with the virus and 44.1 million have died from HIV-related causes.\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus that infects and destroys immune cells. HIV spreads through contact with bodily fluids including blood, semen, vaginal fluids, and breastmilk. This means HIV can spread through activities such as unprotected sex, sharing needles or syringes, or from mother to baby.\nOnce HIV enters the body, it infects T helper cells (also known as CD4 T cells). When HIV enters a T helper cell, it permanently inserts its viral DNA into the cell\u2019s DNA. The virus has now hijacked the T helper cell, using it to make more copies of the virus. The viral DNA from HIV also becomes permanently part of an infected T helper cell\u2019s DNA. This makes it very difficult for the immune system to find and kill the virus. Because of HIV\u2019s ability to quickly hide within your cells and because it mutates very often, developing a vaccine to prevent HIV is very challenging.\nThe first stage of HIV infection is called acute HIV. This is when someone is first infected with HIV and may experience mild flu-like symptoms or no symptoms at all. This can then progress to chronic infection where HIV will continue to replicate inside T helper cells, slowly killing them and infecting more cells. At this stage, it\u2019s likely that the infected person won\u2019t experience any noticeable symptoms. During this time, they can still transmit HIV, even if they don\u2019t realize they have it.\nHIV infection can affect anyone. To learn more or be tested for the virus, talk to a doctor or visit a local health clinic.\nThe final stage of HIV infection is acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). This is when the number of T helper cells becomes very low. This happens years after initial infection and the immune system has been severely weakened by the virus. The T helper cells that HIV infects and destroys are crucial for activating other immune cells to coordinate an immune response. As the number of T helper cells decreases, the immune system becomes weaker, unable to fight off simple infections or prevent the development of cancer.\nA person with AIDS is more likely to get opportunistic infections, which are infections a healthy immune system could normally prevent. They are also more likely to develop certain types of cancer. These infections and cancers are called AIDS-defining illnesses. They occur because the T helper cells that are supposed to help initiate immune responses are too weak to respond. Some examples include Kaposi sarcoma, tuberculosis, or chronic herpes ulcers.\nHIV treatment and prevention have come a long way, but there is no cure. Today, HIV treatment can prevent HIV infection from progressing to AIDS. When taking HIV treatment as prescribed, many people live long lives. Treatment can even reduce HIV to undetectable levels in person, meaning there is so little virus active in your blood that a test cannot detect it. This doesn\u2019t mean you are cured, but it does mean your treatment is working very effectively. Researchers have even determined that when HIV levels are undetectable and stay undetectable, the virus cannot be transmitted. Immunology research over the last 40 years contributed to these major advancements in HIV treatment that allow people to live decades with little to no symptoms of HIV infection.\nImmunology research is continuing to advance HIV treatments and even help find a cure for the infection. Immunotherapy, treatment that enhances the immune system\u2019s ability to fight disease, is providing promise for people with HIV. A study in 2022, found that a cancer immunotherapy, pembrolizumab, can reverse HIV\u2019s ability to hide in immune cells. The virus\u2019s ability to hide is a major barrier to curing HIV, and immunotherapies like this may be a key step in reaching a cure.\nmRNA vaccines are also showing incredible promise in curing HIV. One study found that mRNA can be delivered to the cells where HIV is hiding and provide instructions to the cell that reveal the virus. Being able to reveal the virus and prevent it from hiding can lead to drugs that permanently eliminate HIV from the body. Another study using mRNA vaccines, successfully trained the immune system to recognize and fight HIV, a major battle in developing successful HIV vaccines. With continued advances in immunology and personalized medicine, researchers hope new technology like mRNA vaccines and immunotherpay will finally lead to a cure for HIV.\nThe American Association of Immunologists (\u201cAAI\u201d) websites (www.aai.org, www.immunologyexplained.org, and all related webpages, the \u201cWebsites\u201d) include information meant to inform visitors (\u201cUsers\u201d) about immunology and its related disciplines.

Participants on ART with no detectable virus in their blood stream will receive two long-acting bNAbs (3BNC117-LS-J and 10-1074-LS-J) and then pause ART to determine whether the bNAbs are sufficient to control HIV in the body when ART is stopped.\nA second study, called Antiretrovirals Combined With Antibodies for HIV-1 Cure In Africa (ACACIA), is starting soon and will examine the bNAbs 3BNC117-LS (also known as teropavimab) and 10-1074-LS (also known as zinlirvimab) in adults living with HIV in Botswana, Malawi, South Africa and Zimbabwe who are beginning ART. The bNAbs will be given while there is still virus in the blood stream to see if they can enhance the body\u2019s immune response to HIV, which could reduce the amount of virus that hides in viral reservoirs in the body. Once the bNAbs are no longer present in the body, ART will be interrupted for each participant, and they will be evaluated to determine how long viral suppression is maintained without ART and whether the bNAbs affect the immune response to HIV.\nResearchers are also evaluating bNAb-based HIV cure strategies in children through the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT) Network.

Through a process called budding, virus particles are released from an infected cell as little blobs that protrude outward and then pinch off from the cell membrane. Once released from the host cell, the virus particles are free to move to other cells and infect them.\nThis budding process is emblematic of HIV and other viruses that are surrounded by a membrane, or envelope. Each virus particle takes a bit of cell membrane with it when it departs. By slowly denuding the immune cell of its membrane, the virus kills its host cell. When enough immune cells die, the result is immunodeficiency, or AIDS.\nFor many years, it was believed that this budding process represented a new type of cellular behavior induced by the virus\u2014as if (to use a modern analogy) your computer started sending emails without your permission. Now, researchers with NYU School of Medicine propose that HIV is co-opting a normal form of cell behavior\u2014attaching itself to an email you were sending anyway.\nIn an article published in this week\u2019s Nature, CRI postdoctoral fellow Kaushik Choudhuri, DPhil, and colleagues present evidence that HIV uses the same process that certain immune cells, called T cells, use to communicate with other immune cells.\nT cells facilitate an immune response against pathogens\u2014things like viruses or bacteria\u2014and also against cancer. Receptors located on the surface of a T cell are like the cell\u2019s \u201ceyes,\u201d allowing it to see and recognize signs of these dangerous invaders. When a T cell receptor recognizes and binds to a distinctive marker, or antigen, from a pathogen, the T cell becomes activated. Activated T cells kill infected cells directly and also signal other cells of the immune system to act, triggering an immune response.\nT cells only stay active for a brief period of time, at which point they shut down their receptors. (This shutting down is necessary to prevent autoimmunity.) The accepted process by which T cells shut down their signaling is by internalizing the T cell receptors, smuggling them back inside the cell. But new research suggests that something different is going on.\nWhat Choudhuri and colleagues have found is that immune cells also release T cell receptors (TCR) from the cell surface into the space outside the cell.

Through a process called budding, virus particles are released from an infected cell as little blobs that protrude outward and then pinch off from the cell membrane. Once released from the host cell, the virus particles are free to move to other cells and infect them.\nThis budding process is emblematic of HIV and other viruses that are surrounded by a membrane, or envelope. Each virus particle takes a bit of cell membrane with it when it departs. By slowly denuding the immune cell of its membrane, the virus kills its host cell. When enough immune cells die, the result is immunodeficiency, or AIDS.\nFor many years, it was believed that this budding process represented a new type of cellular behavior induced by the virus\u2014as if (to use a modern analogy) your computer started sending emails without your permission. Now, researchers with NYU School of Medicine propose that HIV is co-opting a normal form of cell behavior\u2014attaching itself to an email you were sending anyway.\nIn an article published in this week\u2019s Nature, CRI postdoctoral fellow Kaushik Choudhuri, DPhil, and colleagues present evidence that HIV uses the same process that certain immune cells, called T cells, use to communicate with other immune cells.\nT cells facilitate an immune response against pathogens\u2014things like viruses or bacteria\u2014and also against cancer. Receptors located on the surface of a T cell are like the cell\u2019s \u201ceyes,\u201d allowing it to see and recognize signs of these dangerous invaders. When a T cell receptor recognizes and binds to a distinctive marker, or antigen, from a pathogen, the T cell becomes activated. Activated T cells kill infected cells directly and also signal other cells of the immune system to act, triggering an immune response.\nT cells only stay active for a brief period of time, at which point they shut down their receptors. (This shutting down is necessary to prevent autoimmunity.) The accepted process by which T cells shut down their signaling is by internalizing the T cell receptors, smuggling them back inside the cell. But new research suggests that something different is going on.\nWhat Choudhuri and colleagues have found is that immune cells also release T cell receptors (TCR) from the cell surface into the space outside the cell.

But HIV is skilled at \u201chiding\u201d and can reappear in the blood stream shortly after ART is stopped. That\u2019s why NIAID and partners are investigating strategies to completely clear HIV from a person\u2019s body, effectively curing them, or to reduce it to levels that can be suppressed by their own immune systems.\nMany promising HIV cure strategies use broadly neutralizing antibodies, or bNAbs, which can neutralize a wide range of HIV variants, homing in on and binding to specific viral components, and then acting to destroy the virus by triggering an immune response. Several HIV bNAbs have been developed and tested to determine whether they can prevent or treat HIV. NIAID and partners are evaluating bNAb-based strategies alone and in combination with other immunity-enhancing strategies for HIV clearance in clinical trials in in Africa, North and South America, and Southeast Asia.\nFinding a cure for HIV is complex, largely due to the tenacity of the virus\u2014it can persist in some tissues or cells without being attacked by the immune system. This is even the case for people whose viral load\u2014the amount of virus in the blood\u2014is suppressed below a level that can be detected by routine diagnostic tools. As a result, most people who experience an interruption in treatment will experience a viral rebound, in which the previously dormant virus begins to replicate and can attack the immune system. This problem is especially urgent for people with HIV who have limited access to treatment, including those in areas with limited resources. A treatment that can be given for a limited time to stop the virus from replicating long term, or one that removes it from the body entirely, could eliminate the need for lifelong treatment, improve quality of life for people with HIV, and reduce further HIV transmission.\nTwo studies beginning this summer are assessing the use of bNAbs to enable HIV remission in people with HIV in African countries. Both studies will include closely monitored ART interruption to examine whether bNAbs can lead to long-term ART-free control of HIV. One trial, called Pausing Antiretroviral Treatment Under Structured Evaluation (PAUSE), enrolled its first participant in June 2024 and continues to enroll people with HIV in Botswana, Malawi, and South Africa. Participants on ART with no detectable virus in their blood stream will receive two long-acting bNAbs (3BNC117-LS-J and 10-1074-LS-J) and then pause ART to determine whether the bNAbs are sufficient to control HIV in the body when ART is stopped.\nA second study, called Antiretrovirals Combined With Antibodies for HIV-1 Cure In Africa (ACACIA), is starting soon and will examine the bNAbs 3BNC117-LS (also known as teropavimab) and 10-1074-LS (also known as zinlirvimab) in adults living with HIV in Botswana, Malawi, South Africa and Zimbabwe who are beginning ART. The bNAbs will be given while there is still virus in the blood stream to see if they can enhance the body\u2019s immune response to HIV, which could reduce the amount of virus that hides in viral reservoirs in the body. Once the bNAbs are no longer present in the body, ART will be interrupted for each participant, and they will be evaluated to determine how long viral suppression is maintained without ART and whether the bNAbs affect the immune response to HIV.\nResearchers are also evaluating bNAb-based HIV cure strategies in children through the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT) Network. The IMPAACT P1115 study has examined very early HIV treatment strategies in infants who were exposed to or acquired HIV before birth. The study is assessing VRC01 and VRC07-523LS to see whether these bNAbs, when given with ART early in life, may enable ART-free remission in children. Another study, IMPAACT 2042, will evaluate the use of three bNAbs, VRC07-523LS, PGDM1400LS, and PGT121.414.LS, in children and young adults with HIV between the ages of 2 and 25 to determine whether the bNAbs can be part of a strategy to suppress HIV and clear the virus from the body.\nOther clinical studies are combining bNAbs with therapeutic vaccines for HIV clearance. These vaccines are designed to improve the immune response to the virus in a person with HIV. ACTG A5374, which enrolled its first participant in early 2024, is evaluating the bNAbs teropavimab and zinlirvimab in combination with the therapeutic vaccines ChAdOx1.HIV cons1/62 and MVA.HIV cons3/4 and an immune booster called vesatolimod. The trial will assess the safety of the regimen in people with HIV in the U.S. and Brazil, and whether the combination can eliminate cells harboring HIV and prevent viral reservoirs from reactivating when ART is interrupted.\nThe findings from these and related trials will provide researchers with new insights into how to effectively treat HIV or clear the virus from people\u2019s bodies.

Diagnosis and staging were based on the 2014 US surveillance case definition for HIV infection. We divided early HIV-1 infection (stage 0) into two subcategories. Subcategory 0\u03b1: a negative or indeterminate HIV-1 antibody test was \u226460 days after the first confirmed positive HIV-1 test or a negative or indeterminate antibody test or qualitative HIV-1 nucleic acid test (NAT) was \u2264180 days before the first positive test, the latter being a NAT or detectable viral load. Subcategory 0\u03b2: a negative or indeterminate antibody or qualitative NAT was \u2264180 days before the first positive test, the latter being an HIV antibody or antigen/antibody test. We compared median earliest viral loads for each stage and subcategory in each of the first 6 weeks after diagnosis using only the earliest viral load for each individual.\nResults: Of 203,392 infections, 56.69% (115,297/203,392) were reported with a quantified earliest viral load within 6 weeks after diagnosis and criteria sufficient to determine the stage at diagnosis. Among 5081 infections at stage 0, the median earliest viral load fell from 694,000 copies/mL in week 1 to 125,022 in week 2 and 43,473 by week 6. Among 30,910 infections in stage 1, the median earliest viral load ranged 15,412-17,495. Among 42,784 infections in stage 2, the median viral load declined from 44,973 in week 1 to 38,497 in week 6. Among 36,522 infections in stage 3 (AIDS), the median viral load dropped from 205,862 in week 1 to 119,000 in week 6. The median earliest viral load in stage 0 subcategory 0\u03b1 fell from 1,344,590 copies/mL in week 1 to 362,467 in week 2 and 47,320 in week 6, while that in subcategory 0\u03b2 was 70,114 copies/mL in week 1 and then 32,033 to 44,067 in weeks 2-6.

It destroys CD4 cells, causing your white blood cell count to drop.\n\nFull Page Content:\nLearn about Human Immunodeficiency Virus and how it causes Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the cause of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV infects and destroys immune cells called CD4 T cells or T helper cells. Overtime the number of your immune cells will decrease as they are killed by the virus, which leads to AIDS. AIDS is when your immune system is significantly weakened by the virus, and you start to experience complications of a weakened immune system. Today, HIV treatment is highly effective at preventing HIV infection from progressing to AIDS and allowing people living with HIV to lead long lives.\nGlobally: In 2024, 40.8 million people worldwide were living with HIV and 1.3 million new people became infected with the virus.\nUS incidence: In 2024, 1.2 million people in the US were living with HIV and 31,800 new people became infected with the virus.\nSince the beginning of the HIV epidemic in 1981, 91.4 million people have been infected with the virus and 44.1 million have died from HIV-related causes.\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus that infects and destroys immune cells. HIV spreads through contact with bodily fluids including blood, semen, vaginal fluids, and breastmilk. This means HIV can spread through activities such as unprotected sex, sharing needles or syringes, or from mother to baby.\nOnce HIV enters the body, it infects T helper cells (also known as CD4 T cells). When HIV enters a T helper cell, it permanently inserts its viral DNA into the cell\u2019s DNA. The virus has now hijacked the T helper cell, using it to make more copies of the virus. The viral DNA from HIV also becomes permanently part of an infected T helper cell\u2019s DNA. This makes it very difficult for the immune system to find and kill the virus. Because of HIV\u2019s ability to quickly hide within your cells and because it mutates very often, developing a vaccine to prevent HIV is very challenging.\nThe first stage of HIV infection is called acute HIV. This is when someone is first infected with HIV and may experience mild flu-like symptoms or no symptoms at all. This can then progress to chronic infection where HIV will continue to replicate inside T helper cells, slowly killing them and infecting more cells. At this stage, it\u2019s likely that the infected person won\u2019t experience any noticeable symptoms. During this time, they can still transmit HIV, even if they don\u2019t realize they have it.\nHIV infection can affect anyone. To learn more or be tested for the virus, talk to a doctor or visit a local health clinic.\nThe final stage of HIV infection is acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). This is when the number of T helper cells becomes very low. This happens years after initial infection and the immune system has been severely weakened by the virus. The T helper cells that HIV infects and destroys are crucial for activating other immune cells to coordinate an immune response. As the number of T helper cells decreases, the immune system becomes weaker, unable to fight off simple infections or prevent the development of cancer.\nA person with AIDS is more likely to get opportunistic infections, which are infections a healthy immune system could normally prevent. They are also more likely to develop certain types of cancer. These infections and cancers are called AIDS-defining illnesses. They occur because the T helper cells that are supposed to help initiate immune responses are too weak to respond. Some examples include Kaposi sarcoma, tuberculosis, or chronic herpes ulcers.\nHIV treatment and prevention have come a long way, but there is no cure. Today, HIV treatment can prevent HIV infection from progressing to AIDS. When taking HIV treatment as prescribed, many people live long lives. Treatment can even reduce HIV to undetectable levels in person, meaning there is so little virus active in your blood that a test cannot detect it. This doesn\u2019t mean you are cured, but it does mean your treatment is working very effectively. Researchers have even determined that when HIV levels are undetectable and stay undetectable, the virus cannot be transmitted. Immunology research over the last 40 years contributed to these major advancements in HIV treatment that allow people to live decades with little to no symptoms of HIV infection.\nImmunology research is continuing to advance HIV treatments and even help find a cure for the infection. Immunotherapy, treatment that enhances the immune system\u2019s ability to fight disease, is providing promise for people with HIV. A study in 2022, found that a cancer immunotherapy, pembrolizumab, can reverse HIV\u2019s ability to hide in immune cells. The virus\u2019s ability to hide is a major barrier to curing HIV, and immunotherapies like this may be a key step in reaching a cure.\nmRNA vaccines are also showing incredible promise in curing HIV. One study found that mRNA can be delivered to the cells where HIV is hiding and provide instructions to the cell that reveal the virus. Being able to reveal the virus and prevent it from hiding can lead to drugs that permanently eliminate HIV from the body. Another study using mRNA vaccines, successfully trained the immune system to recognize and fight HIV, a major battle in developing successful HIV vaccines. With continued advances in immunology and personalized medicine, researchers hope new technology like mRNA vaccines and immunotherpay will finally lead to a cure for HIV.\nThe American Association of Immunologists (\u201cAAI\u201d) websites (www.aai.org, www.immunologyexplained.org, and all related webpages, the \u201cWebsites\u201d) include information meant to inform visitors (\u201cUsers\u201d) about immunology and its related disciplines.

HIV infects and destroys immune cells called CD4 T cells or T helper cells. Overtime the number of your immune cells will decrease as they are killed by the virus, which leads to AIDS. AIDS is when your immune system is significantly weakened by the virus, and you start to experience complications of a weakened immune system. Today, HIV treatment is highly effective at preventing HIV infection from progressing to AIDS and allowing people living with HIV to lead long lives.\nGlobally: In 2024, 40.8 million people worldwide were living with HIV and 1.3 million new people became infected with the virus.\nUS incidence: In 2024, 1.2 million people in the US were living with HIV and 31,800 new people became infected with the virus.\nSince the beginning of the HIV epidemic in 1981, 91.4 million people have been infected with the virus and 44.1 million have died from HIV-related causes.\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus that infects and destroys immune cells. HIV spreads through contact with bodily fluids including blood, semen, vaginal fluids, and breastmilk. This means HIV can spread through activities such as unprotected sex, sharing needles or syringes, or from mother to baby.\nOnce HIV enters the body, it infects T helper cells (also known as CD4 T cells). When HIV enters a T helper cell, it permanently inserts its viral DNA into the cell\u2019s DNA. The virus has now hijacked the T helper cell, using it to make more copies of the virus. The viral DNA from HIV also becomes permanently part of an infected T helper cell\u2019s DNA. This makes it very difficult for the immune system to find and kill the virus. Because of HIV\u2019s ability to quickly hide within your cells and because it mutates very often, developing a vaccine to prevent HIV is very challenging.\nThe first stage of HIV infection is called acute HIV. This is when someone is first infected with HIV and may experience mild flu-like symptoms or no symptoms at all. This can then progress to chronic infection where HIV will continue to replicate inside T helper cells, slowly killing them and infecting more cells. At this stage, it\u2019s likely that the infected person won\u2019t experience any noticeable symptoms. During this time, they can still transmit HIV, even if they don\u2019t realize they have it.\nHIV infection can affect anyone. To learn more or be tested for the virus, talk to a doctor or visit a local health clinic.\nThe final stage of HIV infection is acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). This is when the number of T helper cells becomes very low. This happens years after initial infection and the immune system has been severely weakened by the virus. The T helper cells that HIV infects and destroys are crucial for activating other immune cells to coordinate an immune response. As the number of T helper cells decreases, the immune system becomes weaker, unable to fight off simple infections or prevent the development of cancer.\nA person with AIDS is more likely to get opportunistic infections, which are infections a healthy immune system could normally prevent. They are also more likely to develop certain types of cancer. These infections and cancers are called AIDS-defining illnesses. They occur because the T helper cells that are supposed to help initiate immune responses are too weak to respond. Some examples include Kaposi sarcoma, tuberculosis, or chronic herpes ulcers.\nHIV treatment and prevention have come a long way, but there is no cure. Today, HIV treatment can prevent HIV infection from progressing to AIDS. When taking HIV treatment as prescribed, many people live long lives. Treatment can even reduce HIV to undetectable levels in person, meaning there is so little virus active in your blood that a test cannot detect it. This doesn\u2019t mean you are cured, but it does mean your treatment is working very effectively. Researchers have even determined that when HIV levels are undetectable and stay undetectable, the virus cannot be transmitted. Immunology research over the last 40 years contributed to these major advancements in HIV treatment that allow people to live decades with little to no symptoms of HIV infection.\nImmunology research is continuing to advance HIV treatments and even help find a cure for the infection. Immunotherapy, treatment that enhances the immune system\u2019s ability to fight disease, is providing promise for people with HIV. A study in 2022, found that a cancer immunotherapy, pembrolizumab, can reverse HIV\u2019s ability to hide in immune cells. The virus\u2019s ability to hide is a major barrier to curing HIV, and immunotherapies like this may be a key step in reaching a cure.\nmRNA vaccines are also showing incredible promise in curing HIV. One study found that mRNA can be delivered to the cells where HIV is hiding and provide instructions to the cell that reveal the virus. Being able to reveal the virus and prevent it from hiding can lead to drugs that permanently eliminate HIV from the body. Another study using mRNA vaccines, successfully trained the immune system to recognize and fight HIV, a major battle in developing successful HIV vaccines. With continued advances in immunology and personalized medicine, researchers hope new technology like mRNA vaccines and immunotherpay will finally lead to a cure for HIV.\nThe American Association of Immunologists (\u201cAAI\u201d) websites (www.aai.org, www.immunologyexplained.org, and all related webpages, the \u201cWebsites\u201d) include information meant to inform visitors (\u201cUsers\u201d) about immunology and its related disciplines.

Therefore, this systematic review aims to evaluate and summarize some of the recent trends in HIV medication management. To attain the stated objective, we conducted an in-depth literature search on virtual medical databases including PubMed, Medline, Scopus, and Google Scholar for peer-reviewed articles highlighting novel findings on HIV medication trends. The findings of this systematic review have disclosed that the comprehension of the HIV lifecycle was a breakthrough that enabled the development of effective targeted medications. Further, advancements in prevention interventions have resulted in HIV becoming an increasingly manageable condition. Thus, the amalgamation of biomedical, structural, and behavioral approaches has also reduced the infection rates, even as the progress toward the realization of an effective vaccine continues to sustain the hope of realizing a HIV-free globe. Thus, regardless of the prolonged battle against HIV/AIDS, extant evidence indicates that bringing the epidemic to an end is probable and within our grasp.\nKeywords: antiretroviral therapy, drug resistance, hiv infections, long-acting injectable antiretrovirals, medication adherence\nForty years after the initial reporting of Pneumocystis jirovecci and Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma clusters in New York- and Los Angeles-based homosexuals, HIV/AIDS is still a global public health challenge and concern [1]. According to the recent statistics (2023), approximately 39.9 million individuals are living with HIV/AIDS globally, even as 1.3 million people are projected to have contracted the disease in 2023, and with an average mortality rate of 6.2 per 100,000 individuals in the same year [2]. Consequently, a larger proportion of individuals living with HIV/AIDS are residents of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), with the sub-Saharan Africa region being the most affected, with approximately 20.8 million individuals living with the disease as of 2023 [3]. As such, the concerted efforts made in the last four decades have resulted in human immunodeficiency virus infections moving from horrific and lethal diseases to increasingly manageable conditions [4]. For instance, combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been effective in significantly reducing the viral load to undetectable levels (<50 RNA copies/mL), leading to a considerable prevention of opportunistic infections and reconstitution of the immune systems of persons living with HIV [5]. As a result, many individuals living with HIV are presently living normal lives.\nNevertheless, regardless of the above attainments, the HIV pandemic still affects women disproportionately, particularly in nations and regions with prevalent other transmission routes [1-4]. Females have limited alternatives to safeguard themselves from HIV infections, and approaches aimed at promoting abstinence, condom use, and monogamy have not been effective in preventing the spread of the disease and are impractical in most contexts [1-3]. Thus, women face significant challenges in efforts to convince their male partners to be faithful, monogamous, or use condoms. Consequently, female condoms that were developed to enable women to have more control in HIV prevention and protect themselves have not been widely accepted, even as their higher costs and structural concerns have hindered their adoption. However, HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is offering a promising novel approach to reducing HIV spread across the globe [6]. Still, the development of various microbicides, comprising products that are mostly applied in the vagina and rectum for protection against HIV, offers increased potential for women-controlled preventive alternatives that do not require any consent, control, or knowledge of one\u2019s partner [7-10]. Although microbicides have the potential of being beneficial to women and men, their effective usage is still reliant on their approval and efficiency. Long-term success in the management and treatment of HIV requires continuous advancement and improvement of existing medications, as well as the development of newer drugs with fewer side effects, prolonged action with lasting virologic suppression, and a higher genetic barrier to resistance development [11-15].\nNotably, being an RNA virus, HIV converts the RNA into double-stranded DNA upon entry into the human cell, with the aid of the reverse transcriptase (RT), which was the main target of the initial HIV medications, including zidovudine (AZT) [3]. The FDA developed and approved various nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in 1991, including didanosine, zalcitabine, and stavudine [16-18]. Regrettably, the RT enzyme is highly prone to errors, and HIV rapidly develops mutants capable of escaping such medications, leading to resistance to drugs and drastic relapse in patients. The introduction of protease inhibitors in the 1990s marked the start of the development of highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART), leading to a significant reduction in mortality rates. Subsequent innovations, which included the integrase inhibitors and long-acting injectables, have enhanced adherence, effectiveness, and tolerability. Currently, PrEP and other new drug formulations have continued to improve HIV prevention, management, and treatment, marking significant scientific advancement. As a result, HIV medication and management have evolved and transformed the condition from a severe and fatal infection to an increasingly manageable condition. Thus, since the discovery of HIV in the 1980s, significant progress has been realized with ART, particularly the progression from single-drug treatments with higher toxicity levels and increased resistance risks to innovat\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

As the number of T helper cells ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nLearn about Human Immunodeficiency Virus and how it causes Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the cause of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV infects and destroys immune cells called CD4 T cells or T helper cells. Overtime the number of your immune cells will decrease as they are killed by the virus, which leads to AIDS. AIDS is when your immune system is significantly weakened by the virus, and you start to experience complications of a weakened immune system. Today, HIV treatment is highly effective at preventing HIV infection from progressing to AIDS and allowing people living with HIV to lead long lives.\nGlobally: In 2024, 40.8 million people worldwide were living with HIV and 1.3 million new people became infected with the virus.\nUS incidence: In 2024, 1.2 million people in the US were living with HIV and 31,800 new people became infected with the virus.\nSince the beginning of the HIV epidemic in 1981, 91.4 million people have been infected with the virus and 44.1 million have died from HIV-related causes.\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus that infects and destroys immune cells. HIV spreads through contact with bodily fluids including blood, semen, vaginal fluids, and breastmilk. This means HIV can spread through activities such as unprotected sex, sharing needles or syringes, or from mother to baby.\nOnce HIV enters the body, it infects T helper cells (also known as CD4 T cells). When HIV enters a T helper cell, it permanently inserts its viral DNA into the cell\u2019s DNA. The virus has now hijacked the T helper cell, using it to make more copies of the virus. The viral DNA from HIV also becomes permanently part of an infected T helper cell\u2019s DNA. This makes it very difficult for the immune system to find and kill the virus. Because of HIV\u2019s ability to quickly hide within your cells and because it mutates very often, developing a vaccine to prevent HIV is very challenging.\nThe first stage of HIV infection is called acute HIV. This is when someone is first infected with HIV and may experience mild flu-like symptoms or no symptoms at all. This can then progress to chronic infection where HIV will continue to replicate inside T helper cells, slowly killing them and infecting more cells. At this stage, it\u2019s likely that the infected person won\u2019t experience any noticeable symptoms. During this time, they can still transmit HIV, even if they don\u2019t realize they have it.\nHIV infection can affect anyone. To learn more or be tested for the virus, talk to a doctor or visit a local health clinic.\nThe final stage of HIV infection is acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). This is when the number of T helper cells becomes very low. This happens years after initial infection and the immune system has been severely weakened by the virus. The T helper cells that HIV infects and destroys are crucial for activating other immune cells to coordinate an immune response. As the number of T helper cells decreases, the immune system becomes weaker, unable to fight off simple infections or prevent the development of cancer.\nA person with AIDS is more likely to get opportunistic infections, which are infections a healthy immune system could normally prevent. They are also more likely to develop certain types of cancer. These infections and cancers are called AIDS-defining illnesses. They occur because the T helper cells that are supposed to help initiate immune responses are too weak to respond. Some examples include Kaposi sarcoma, tuberculosis, or chronic herpes ulcers.\nHIV treatment and prevention have come a long way, but there is no cure. Today, HIV treatment can prevent HIV infection from progressing to AIDS. When taking HIV treatment as prescribed, many people live long lives. Treatment can even reduce HIV to undetectable levels in person, meaning there is so little virus active in your blood that a test cannot detect it. This doesn\u2019t mean you are cured, but it does mean your treatment is working very effectively. Researchers have even determined that when HIV levels are undetectable and stay undetectable, the virus cannot be transmitted. Immunology research over the last 40 years contributed to these major advancements in HIV treatment that allow people to live decades with little to no symptoms of HIV infection.\nImmunology research is continuing to advance HIV treatments and even help find a cure for the infection. Immunotherapy, treatment that enhances the immune system\u2019s ability to fight disease, is providing promise for people with HIV. A study in 2022, found that a cancer immunotherapy, pembrolizumab, can reverse HIV\u2019s ability to hide in immune cells. The virus\u2019s ability to hide is a major barrier to curing HIV, and immunotherapies like this may be a key step in reaching a cure.\nmRNA vaccines are also showing incredible promise in curing HIV. One study found that mRNA can be delivered to the cells where HIV is hiding and provide instructions to the cell that reveal the virus. Being able to reveal the virus and prevent it from hiding can lead to drugs that permanently eliminate HIV from the body. Another study using mRNA vaccines, successfully trained the immune system to recognize and fight HIV, a major battle in developing successful HIV vaccines. With continued advances in immunology and personalized medicine, researchers hope new technology like mRNA vaccines and immunotherpay will finally lead to a cure for HIV.\nThe American Association of Immunologists (\u201cAAI\u201d) websites (www.aai.org, www.immunologyexplained.org, and all related webpages, the \u201cWebsites\u201d) include information meant to inform visitors (\u201cUsers\u201d) about immunology and its related disciplines.

According to the recent statistics (2023), approximately 39.9 million individuals are living with HIV/AIDS globally, even as 1.3 million people are projected to have contracted the disease in 2023, and with an average mortality rate of 6.2 per 100,000 individuals in the same year [2]. Consequently, a larger proportion of individuals living with HIV/AIDS are residents of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), with the sub-Saharan Africa region being the most affected, with approximately 20.8 million individuals living with the disease as of 2023 [3].

Therefore, this systematic review aims to evaluate and summarize some of the recent trends in HIV medication management. To attain the stated objective, we conducted an in-depth literature search on virtual medical databases including PubMed, Medline, Scopus, and Google Scholar for peer-reviewed articles highlighting novel findings on HIV medication trends. The findings of this systematic review have disclosed that the comprehension of the HIV lifecycle was a breakthrough that enabled the development of effective targeted medications. Further, advancements in prevention interventions have resulted in HIV becoming an increasingly manageable condition. Thus, the amalgamation of biomedical, structural, and behavioral approaches has also reduced the infection rates, even as the progress toward the realization of an effective vaccine continues to sustain the hope of realizing a HIV-free globe. Thus, regardless of the prolonged battle against HIV/AIDS, extant evidence indicates that bringing the epidemic to an end is probable and within our grasp.\nKeywords: antiretroviral therapy, drug resistance, hiv infections, long-acting injectable antiretrovirals, medication adherence\nForty years after the initial reporting of Pneumocystis jirovecci and Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma clusters in New York- and Los Angeles-based homosexuals, HIV/AIDS is still a global public health challenge and concern [1]. According to the recent statistics (2023), approximately 39.9 million individuals are living with HIV/AIDS globally, even as 1.3 million people are projected to have contracted the disease in 2023, and with an average mortality rate of 6.2 per 100,000 individuals in the same year [2]. Consequently, a larger proportion of individuals living with HIV/AIDS are residents of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), with the sub-Saharan Africa region being the most affected, with approximately 20.8 million individuals living with the disease as of 2023 [3]. As such, the concerted efforts made in the last four decades have resulted in human immunodeficiency virus infections moving from horrific and lethal diseases to increasingly manageable conditions [4]. For instance, combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been effective in significantly reducing the viral load to undetectable levels (<50 RNA copies/mL), leading to a considerable prevention of opportunistic infections and reconstitution of the immune systems of persons living with HIV [5]. As a result, many individuals living with HIV are presently living normal lives.\nNevertheless, regardless of the above attainments, the HIV pandemic still affects women disproportionately, particularly in nations and regions with prevalent other transmission routes [1-4]. Females have limited alternatives to safeguard themselves from HIV infections, and approaches aimed at promoting abstinence, condom use, and monogamy have not been effective in preventing the spread of the disease and are impractical in most contexts [1-3]. Thus, women face significant challenges in efforts to convince their male partners to be faithful, monogamous, or use condoms. Consequently, female condoms that were developed to enable women to have more control in HIV prevention and protect themselves have not been widely accepted, even as their higher costs and structural concerns have hindered their adoption. However, HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is offering a promising novel approach to reducing HIV spread across the globe [6]. Still, the development of various microbicides, comprising products that are mostly applied in the vagina and rectum for protection against HIV, offers increased potential for women-controlled preventive alternatives that do not require any consent, control, or knowledge of one\u2019s partner [7-10]. Although microbicides have the potential of being beneficial to women and men, their effective usage is still reliant on their approval and efficiency. Long-term success in the management and treatment of HIV requires continuous advancement and improvement of existing medications, as well as the development of newer drugs with fewer side effects, prolonged action with lasting virologic suppression, and a higher genetic barrier to resistance development [11-15].\nNotably, being an RNA virus, HIV converts the RNA into double-stranded DNA upon entry into the human cell, with the aid of the reverse transcriptase (RT), which was the main target of the initial HIV medications, including zidovudine (AZT) [3]. The FDA developed and approved various nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in 1991, including didanosine, zalcitabine, and stavudine [16-18]. Regrettably, the RT enzyme is highly prone to errors, and HIV rapidly develops mutants capable of escaping such medications, leading to resistance to drugs and drastic relapse in patients. The introduction of protease inhibitors in the 1990s marked the start of the development of highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART), leading to a significant reduction in mortality rates. Subsequent innovations, which included the integrase inhibitors and long-acting injectables, have enhanced adherence, effectiveness, and tolerability. Currently, PrEP and other new drug formulations have continued to improve HIV prevention, management, and treatment, marking significant scientific advancement. As a result, HIV medication and management have evolved and transformed the condition from a severe and fatal infection to an increasingly manageable condition. Thus, since the discovery of HIV in the 1980s, significant progress has been realized with ART, particularly the progression from single-drug treatments with higher toxicity levels and increased resistance risks to innovat\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",
