    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nHubris is a Greek word that means dangerously overconfident. Based on my research, hubris fairly describes our current response to the issue of climate change. Here\u2019s what many people believe: One: The planet is warming catastrophically because of certain human behaviors. Two: Thanks to powerful computers we can project what the climate will be like 20, 40, or even 100 years from now. Three: That if we eliminate just one behavior, the burning of fossil fuels, we can prevent the climate from changing for as long we like. Each of these presumptions\u2014together, the basis of our hubris regarding the changing climate\u2014is either untrue or so far off the mark as to be useless. Yes, it\u2019s true that the globe is warming, and that humans are exerting a warming influence upon it. But beyond that, to paraphrase a line from the classic movie The Princess Bride, \u201cI do not think \u2018The Science\u2019 says what you think it says.\u201d For example, government reports state clearly that heat waves in the US are now no more common than they were in 1900. Hurricane activity is no different than it was a century ago. Floods have not increased across the globe over more than seventy years. Greenland\u2019s ice sheet isn\u2019t shrinking any more rapidly today than it was 80 years ago. Why aren\u2019t these reassuring facts better known? Because the public gets its climate information almost exclusively from the media. And from a media perspective, fear sells. \u201cThings aren\u2019t that bad\u201d doesn\u2019t sell. Very few people, and that includes journalists who report on climate news, read the actual science. I have. And what the data\u2014the hard science\u2014from the US government and UN Climate reports say is that\u2026 \u201cthings aren\u2019t that bad.\u201d Nor does the public understand the questionable basis of all catastrophic climate change projections: computer modeling. Projecting future climate is excruciatingly difficult. Yes, there are human influences, but the climate is complex. Anyone who says that climate models are \u201cjust physics\u201d either doesn\u2019t understand them or is being deliberately misleading. I should know: I wrote one of the first textbooks on computer modeling. While modelers base their assumptions upon both fundamental physical laws and observations of the climate, there is still considerable judgment involved. And since different modelers will make different assumptions, results vary widely among different models. Let\u2019s just take one simple, but significant assumption modelers must make: the impact of clouds on the climate. Natural fluctuations in the height and coverage of clouds have at least as much of an impact on the flows of sunlight and heat as do human influences. But how can we possibly know global cloud coverage say 10, let alone 50 years from now? Obviously, we can\u2019t. But to create a climate model, we have to make assumptions. That\u2019s a pretty shaky foundation on which to transform the world\u2019s economy. By the way, creating more accurate models isn\u2019t getting any easier. In fact, the more we learn about the climate system, the more we realize how complex it is. Rather than admit this complexity, the media, the politicians, and a good portion of the climate science community attribute every terrible storm, every flood, every major fire to \u201cclimate change.\u201d Yes, we\u2019ve always had these weather events in the past, the narrative goes, but somehow \u201cclimate change\u201d is making everything \u201cworse.\u201d Even if that were true, isn\u2019t the relevant question, how much worse? Not to mention that \u201cworse\u201d is not exactly a scientific term. And how would we make it better? For the alarmists, that\u2019s easy: we get rid of fossil fuels. Not only is this impractical\u2014we get over 80% of the world\u2019s energy from fossil fuels\u2014it\u2019s not scientifically possible. That\u2019s because CO2 doesn\u2019t disappear from the atmosphere in a few days like, say, smog. It hangs around for a really long time. About 60 percent of any CO2 that we emit today will remain in the atmosphere 20 years from now, between 30 and 55 percent will still be there after a century, and between 15 and 30 percent will remain after one thousand years. In other words, it takes centuries for the excess carbon dioxide to vanish from the atmosphere. So, any partial reductions in CO2 emissions would only slow the increase in human influences\u2014not prevent it, let alone reverse it. CO2 is not a knob that we can just turn down to fix everything. We don\u2019t have that ability. To think that we do is\u2026 hubris. Hubris leads to bad decisions. A little humility and a little knowledge would lead to better ones.

Over the last century, burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nHuman activities are driving the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century.\nScientists attribute the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century to the human expansion of the \"greenhouse effect\"1 \u2014 warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth toward space.\nLife on Earth depends on energy coming from the Sun. About half the light energy reaching Earth's atmosphere passes through the air and clouds to the surface, where it is absorbed and radiated in the form of infrared heat. About 90% of this heat is then absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-radiated, slowing heat loss to space.\nA vital component of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide (CO2) is released through natural processes (like volcanic eruptions) and through human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation.\nLike many atmospheric gases, methane comes from both natural and human-caused sources. Methane comes from plant-matter breakdown in wetlands and is also released from landfills and rice farming. Livestock animals emit methane from their digestion and manure. Leaks from fossil fuel production and transportation are another major source of methane, and natural gas is 70% to 90% methane.\nA potent greenhouse gas produced by farming practices, nitrous oxide is released during commercial and organic fertilizer production and use. Nitrous oxide also comes from burning fossil fuels and burning vegetation and has increased by 18% in the last 100 years.\nThese chemical compounds do not exist in nature \u2013 they are entirely of industrial origin. They were used as refrigerants, solvents (a substance that dissolves others), and spray can propellants.\nFORCING: Something acting upon Earth's climate that causes a change in how energy flows through it (such as long-lasting, heat-trapping gases - also known as greenhouse gases). These gases slow outgoing heat in the atmosphere and cause the planet to warm.\nWater vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas, but because the warming ocean increases the amount of it in our atmosphere, it is not a direct cause of climate change. Credit: John Fowler on Unsplash\nFEEDBACKS: A process where something is either amplified or reduced as time goes on, such as water vapor increasing as Earth warms leading to even more warming.\nOver the last century, burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). This increase happens because the coal or oil burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the air to make CO2. To a lesser extent, clearing of land for agriculture, industry, and other human activities has increased concentrations of greenhouse gases.\nThe industrial activities that our modern civilization depends upon have raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels by nearly 50% since 17502. This increase is due to human activities, because scientists can see a distinctive isotopic fingerprint in the atmosphere.\nIn its Sixth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, composed of scientific experts from countries all over the world, concluded that it is unequivocal that the increase of CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere over the industrial era is the result of human activities and that human influence is the principal driver of many changes observed across the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nThe panel's AR6 Working Group I (WGI) Summary for Policymakers report is online at https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/.\nScientists use a metric called Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) to measure the changes in energy the Earth receives from the Sun. TSI incorporates the 11-year solar cycle and solar flares/storms from the Sun's surface.\nStudies show that solar variability has played a role in past climate changes. For example, a decrease in solar activity coupled with increased volcanic activity helped trigger the Little Ice Age.\nBut several lines of evidence show that current global warming cannot be explained by changes in energy from the Sun:\n1.

Human activities are driving large scale changes in terrestrial and aquatic environments through pollution, water withdrawals, the hunting and harvesting of organisms, and the movement of invasive species around the globe [1]. The sustained overuse of natural resources has caused unprecedented levels of environmental destruction, including the loss of ecosystems and biodiversity [2].\nOne overarching result of human overreach is climate change. Greenhouse gases emitted from land use, industry, and the escalating use of fossil fuels are elevating Earth\u2019s temperature faster than at any point since the dawn of civilization [3]. This warming is altering Earth\u2019s capacity to supply food and fresh water and to sustain human health and well-being [4]. Climate impacts such as weather extremes and wildfires are hitting harder and sooner than scientists anticipated even 10 years ago [4].\nWhile the global population is projected to grow substantially over coming decades, ecosystem degradation and climate change threaten human prospects. Limiting the impacts requires shrinking humanity\u2019s environmental footprint with a global shift toward renewable energy sources, sustainable land use practices, and responsible consumption patterns. Underlying this shift is the need to account for human populations responsibly by ensuring that family planning information and services are available to all who desire them.\nWhile it is impossible to put a price tag on a healthy planet, economists calculate that the value of the services provided each year by well-functioning terrestrial ecosystems is at least equivalent to the annual global gross domestic product (GDP) [5]. Thriving ecosystems produce oxygen, purify water, protect from storms, provide food, and regulate the climate.\nYet humanity has an extensive history of using Earth\u2019s life-sustaining natural resources unsustainably. The aggregate human demands on resources have exceeded the Earth\u2019s regenerative capacity since the 1970s. The Global Footprint Network notes that \u201cmore than 80% of the world\u2019s population lives in countries that are running ecological deficits, using more resources than what their ecosystems can regenerate,\u201d by \u201coverfishing, over-harvesting forests, and emitting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than forests can sequester\u201d [6]. The organization tallies that it takes a year for Earth to rebuild the resources people use in just seven months [7].\nFor most of human history, people had little effect on the global climate. The dawn of the industrial era signaled a turning point. Starting around 1750, growing and industrializing populations ramped up the burning of fossil fuels, emitting heat-trapping greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane into the atmosphere. Over the decades, the use of fossil fuels has increased, first with coal, then oil, and then natural gas. Meanwhile, the clearing of forests and other natural ecosystems for farming and development has released additional greenhouse gases while reducing nature\u2019s capacity for carbon absorption [8].\nSince the Industrial Revolution, humans have released enough greenhouse gases into the atmosphere to raise the average global temperature by 1.1\u00b0C (close to 2\u00b0F) [8]. Warming has increased more rapidly since the 1970s than at any point in modern history [8]. At the same time, the global population has more than doubled [9]. The effects of this warming vary by region and include longer wildfire seasons, melting glaciers and ice caps, and more extreme weather such as heatwaves, more powerful storms, and flooding. Climate scientists warn that global temperature increases of 1.5\u00b0C and beyond will have far more devastating effects, from more destructive storms and prolonged droughts to inundation of coastal areas from mounting sea-level rise [10]. The impacts are magnified with each additional degree of warming [8].\nGovernments around the world are working to avoid dangerous climate change. Nearly every country is party to the Paris Agreement Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which aims to hold the global temperature rise \u201cto well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursu[e] efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change\u201d [11].\nAt recent emissions rates, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that warming could reach 1.5\u00b0C (2.7\u00b0F) between 2030 and 2052 (see Figure 1) [10]. Climate scientists maintain that keeping warming from exceeding that level would require global greenhouse gas emissions to decrease by 8.7% each year between 2024 and 2030 [12]. Even keeping warming to 2\u00b0C would require emissions cuts of 5.3% each year [12]. Yet while some progress is being made to achieve national goals, global emissions have continued to rise [13].\nThe risks from climate change are multiplying. These changes will impact the world\u2019s population in many ways, but specifically in terms of the capacity to use and manage land, adapt to extreme weather events, produce food, and access fresh water [14].

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is accumulating in the atmosphere faster than any time experienced during human existence, rising by more than 10% in just two decades.\nIn the course of 2023, large vegetation fire CO2 emissions and a possible reduction in carbon absorption by forests combined with stubbornly high fossil fuel CO2 emissions from human and industrial activities to drive the increase, according to the WMO\u2019s annual Greenhouse Gas Bulletin.\nThe globally-averaged surface concentration of CO2 reached 420.0 parts per million (ppm), methane 1 934 parts per billion and nitrous oxide 336.9 parts per billion (ppb) in 2023. These values are 151%, 265% and 125% of pre-industrial (before 1750) levels, it said. These are calculated on the basis of the long-term observations within the Global Atmosphere Watch network of monitoring stations.\n\u201cAnother year. Another record. This should set alarm bells ringing among decision makers. We are clearly off track to meet the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to well below 2\u00b0C and aiming for 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. These are more than just statistics. Every part per million and every fraction of a degree temperature increase has a real impact on our lives and our planet,\u201d said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo.\nThe 2023 increase of CO2 in the atmosphere was higher than that of 2022, although lower than that of the three years before that. The annual increase of 2.3 ppm marked the 12th consecutive year with an increase greater than 2 ppm.\nThe WMO Greenhouse Gas Bulletin is one of WMO\u2019s flagship publications released to inform the UN Climate Change conference, COP, and is now in its 20th issue. During that time the CO2 level has increased by 11.4 % (42.9 ppm) above the level of 377.1 ppm recorded in 2004 by WMO\u2019s Global Atmosphere Watch network of monitoring stations.\nThe Greenhouse Gas Bulletin reports on greenhouse gas concentrations, rather than on emission levels. Analysis of data shows that just under half of CO2 emissions remain in the atmosphere. Just over one quarter are absorbed by the ocean and just under 30% by land ecosystems \u2013 although there is considerable year-to-year variability in this because of naturally occurring phenomena like El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a.\nThe Greenhouse Gas Bulletin complements the UN Environment Programme\u2019s Emissions Gap report. Both were published ahead of COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan.\nDuring El Ni\u00f1o years, greenhouse gas levels tend to rise because drier vegetation and forest fires reduce the efficiency of land carbon sinks.\n\u201cThe Bulletin warns that we face a potential vicious cycle. Natural climate variability plays a big role in carbon cycle. But in the near future, climate change itself could cause ecosystems to become larger sources of greenhouse gases. Wildfires could release more carbon emissions into the atmosphere, whilst the warmer ocean might absorb less CO2. Consequently, more CO2 could stay in the atmosphere to accelerate global warming. These climate feedbacks are critical concerns to human society,\u201d said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Ko Barrett.\nFrom 1990 to 2023, radiative forcing \u2013 the warming effect on our climate - by long-lived greenhouse gases increased by 51.5%, with CO2 accounting for about 81% of this increase, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Annual Greenhouse Gas Index cited in the WMO Bulletin.\nAs long as emissions continue, greenhouse gases will continue accumulating in the atmosphere leading to global temperature rise. Given the extremely long life of CO2 in the atmosphere, the temperature level already observed will persist for several decades even if emissions are rapidly reduced to net zero.\nThe last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was 3-5 million years ago, when the temperature was 2-3\u00b0C warmer and sea level was 10-20 meters higher than now.\nCO2 is the single most important greenhouse gas in the atmosphere related to human activities, accounting for approximately 64% of the warming effect on the climate, mainly because of fossil fuel combustion and cement production.\nThe 2023 increase of CO2 in the atmosphere was higher than that of 2022, although lower than that of the three years before that. The annual increase of 2.3 ppm marked the 12th consecutive year with an increase greater than 2 ppm, while the increase within the year 2023 was one of the largest (2.8 ppm).\nThe long-term CO2 increase is due to fossil fuel combustion but there are year-to-year variations due to the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation, which impacts photosynthetic CO2 uptake, respiratory release, and fires. In May 2023, Earth transitioned from a 3-year long La Ni\u00f1a to El Ni\u00f1o.\nIn 2023, global fire carbon emissions were 16 % above average, seventh amongst all fire seasons since 2003. Canada experienced its worst wildfire season on record. Australia experienced its driest three-month period on record in 2023 from August to October, with severe bushfires.\nMethane is a powerful greenhouse gas which remains in the atmosphere for about a decade.\nMethane accounts for about 16% of the warming effect of long-lived greenhouse gases. Approximately 40% of methane is emitted into the atmosphere by natural sources (for example, wetlands and termites), and about 60% comes from anthropogenic sources (for example, ruminants, rice agriculture, fossil fuel exploitation, landfills and biomass burning).\nThe growth in atmospheric methane in 2023 was smaller than 2022 \u2013 but was record high for the five-year period. Detailed analysis indicates an emission increase from sources such as wetlands and agriculture, which could at least partly be due to on-going climate feedback that further increases greenhouse gas emissions from the natural systems.\nNitrous Oxide is both a powerful gree\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is accumulating in the atmosphere faster than any time experienced during human existence, rising by more than 10% in just two decades.\nIn the course of 2023, large vegetation fire CO2 emissions and a possible reduction in carbon absorption by forests combined with stubbornly high fossil fuel CO2 emissions from human and industrial activities to drive the increase, according to the WMO\u2019s annual Greenhouse Gas Bulletin.\nThe globally-averaged surface concentration of CO2 reached 420.0 parts per million (ppm), methane 1 934 parts per billion and nitrous oxide 336.9 parts per billion (ppb) in 2023. These values are 151%, 265% and 125% of pre-industrial (before 1750) levels, it said. These are calculated on the basis of the long-term observations within the Global Atmosphere Watch network of monitoring stations.\n\u201cAnother year. Another record. This should set alarm bells ringing among decision makers. We are clearly off track to meet the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to well below 2\u00b0C and aiming for 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. These are more than just statistics. Every part per million and every fraction of a degree temperature increase has a real impact on our lives and our planet,\u201d said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo.\nThe 2023 increase of CO2 in the atmosphere was higher than that of 2022, although lower than that of the three years before that. The annual increase of 2.3 ppm marked the 12th consecutive year with an increase greater than 2 ppm.\nThe WMO Greenhouse Gas Bulletin is one of WMO\u2019s flagship publications released to inform the UN Climate Change conference, COP, and is now in its 20th issue. During that time the CO2 level has increased by 11.4 % (42.9 ppm) above the level of 377.1 ppm recorded in 2004 by WMO\u2019s Global Atmosphere Watch network of monitoring stations.\nThe Greenhouse Gas Bulletin reports on greenhouse gas concentrations, rather than on emission levels. Analysis of data shows that just under half of CO2 emissions remain in the atmosphere. Just over one quarter are absorbed by the ocean and just under 30% by land ecosystems \u2013 although there is considerable year-to-year variability in this because of naturally occurring phenomena like El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a.\nThe Greenhouse Gas Bulletin complements the UN Environment Programme\u2019s Emissions Gap report. Both were published ahead of COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan.\nDuring El Ni\u00f1o years, greenhouse gas levels tend to rise because drier vegetation and forest fires reduce the efficiency of land carbon sinks.\n\u201cThe Bulletin warns that we face a potential vicious cycle. Natural climate variability plays a big role in carbon cycle. But in the near future, climate change itself could cause ecosystems to become larger sources of greenhouse gases. Wildfires could release more carbon emissions into the atmosphere, whilst the warmer ocean might absorb less CO2. Consequently, more CO2 could stay in the atmosphere to accelerate global warming. These climate feedbacks are critical concerns to human society,\u201d said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Ko Barrett.\nFrom 1990 to 2023, radiative forcing \u2013 the warming effect on our climate - by long-lived greenhouse gases increased by 51.5%, with CO2 accounting for about 81% of this increase, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Annual Greenhouse Gas Index cited in the WMO Bulletin.\nAs long as emissions continue, greenhouse gases will continue accumulating in the atmosphere leading to global temperature rise. Given the extremely long life of CO2 in the atmosphere, the temperature level already observed will persist for several decades even if emissions are rapidly reduced to net zero.\nThe last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was 3-5 million years ago, when the temperature was 2-3\u00b0C warmer and sea level was 10-20 meters higher than now.\nCO2 is the single most important greenhouse gas in the atmosphere related to human activities, accounting for approximately 64% of the warming effect on the climate, mainly because of fossil fuel combustion and cement production.\nThe 2023 increase of CO2 in the atmosphere was higher than that of 2022, although lower than that of the three years before that. The annual increase of 2.3 ppm marked the 12th consecutive year with an increase greater than 2 ppm, while the increase within the year 2023 was one of the largest (2.8 ppm).\nThe long-term CO2 increase is due to fossil fuel combustion but there are year-to-year variations due to the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation, which impacts photosynthetic CO2 uptake, respiratory release, and fires. In May 2023, Earth transitioned from a 3-year long La Ni\u00f1a to El Ni\u00f1o.\nIn 2023, global fire carbon emissions were 16 % above average, seventh amongst all fire seasons since 2003. Canada experienced its worst wildfire season on record. Australia experienced its driest three-month period on record in 2023 from August to October, with severe bushfires.\nMethane is a powerful greenhouse gas which remains in the atmosphere for about a decade.\nMethane accounts for about 16% of the warming effect of long-lived greenhouse gases. Approximately 40% of methane is emitted into the atmosphere by natural sources (for example, wetlands and termites), and about 60% comes from anthropogenic sources (for example, ruminants, rice agriculture, fossil fuel exploitation, landfills and biomass burning).\nThe growth in atmospheric methane in 2023 was smaller than 2022 \u2013 but was record high for the five-year period. Detailed analysis indicates an emission increase from sources such as wetlands and agriculture, which could at least partly be due to on-going climate feedback that further increases greenhouse gas emissions from the natural systems.\nNitrous Oxide is both a powerful gree\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Content is not being updated or maintained, and some links may no longer work.\nChristopher W. Landsea is the Chief of the Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch at the National Weather Service's (NWS) National Hurricane Center (NHC) in Miami, FL. Tom Knutson is a Senior Scientist at NOAA\u2019s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GDFL) in Princeton, NJ. The following discussion represents the authors\u2019 opinions only and does not represent any official position of NHC, NWS, GFDL, or NOAA in general. A NOAA State of the Science Fact Sheet on \u201cAtlantic Hurricanes and Climate\u201d, which has been reviewed by NOAA, is also available.\nLast summer, one of us (Chris) co-wrote a National Hurricane Center Inside the Eye blog post about the 2020 hurricane season and whether it was truly as \u201crecord-breaking\u201d as it seemed. We also talked about how an apparent doubling in the number of Atlantic tropical storms and hurricanes over the past century is more likely due to better observation technology than to actual increases in storms from natural or man-made climate change.\nTracks and intensities of storms during the exceptionally active 2020 Atlantic hurricane season. Map by Wikimedia user MasterOGarfield, based on NOAA hurricane track data.\nLikewise, we think that better storm tracking played a significant role in the boost in what counts as average or \u201cnormal\u201d conditions from 12 to 14 named storms as the National Hurricane center shifted its baseline from 1981-2010 to 1991-2020. Satellites and other technological advances allow the National Hurricane Center to observe and accurately diagnose more weak, short-lived named storms than had been done previously.\nIn this blog post, we address the more general question of whether scientists can detect any significant change in observed Atlantic hurricane activity due to man-made climate change. This involves a careful analysis of observations, data quality, and modeling results.\nAs discussed in the previous blog post, when looking for evidence of climate change in past records of hurricanes and tropical storms, one has to account for \u201cmissing\u201d tropical systems that occurred in the past but were not recorded due to lack of satellite imagery. For example, the figure below\u2014from a new study by the authors and colleagues (Vecchi et al. in 2021\u2019s Nature Communications)\u2014provides a best estimate of how many hurricanes occurred over the North Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, and Gulf of Mexico back to the 1850s, including an estimate of \u201cmissing\u201d storms.\n(red line) An estimate of the number of tropical cyclones in the Atlantic basin (15-year running average) that were likely missed early in the historical record due to sparse observations. (blue line) Total number of Atlantic hurricanes, including those that were recorded and those that were likely missed. Image adapted from Vecchi et al., 2021.\nThe red line in the figure above is the estimated number of \u201cmissed\u201d hurricanes from the Vecchi et al. (2021) study, with the red shading showing the uncertainty in those estimates. The blue line is the total number of hurricanes (both observed and estimated missed) in a centered 15-year average, derived from the years 1851-2019, with the blue shading showing the uncertainty. The dark and light gray shadings before 1900 provide a caution that this approach is more uncertain during the 19th Century than the 20th Century for estimating the total number of hurricanes per year.\nThe graph shows distinctly busy and quiet periods: higher hurricane numbers in the late 19th century, mid-20th century, and from the mid-1990s onward, but lower numbers in the early 20th century, and in the 1970s to early-1990s. It\u2019s also worth pointing out that there is no significant trend upward in the estimated total number of hurricanes. Chris also demonstrated (in 2015\u2019s Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society) that the number of hurricanes affecting the U.S. (with no adjustments required) shows no significant trend since 1900, in agreement with the Vecchi et al. basin-wide estimated reconstructions and with updated U.S. landfalling hurricane and major hurricane time series.\nThere is a good understanding of the environmental conditions that accompany these decade-to-decade swings in hurricane activity. For example, the depiction below from a 2007 paper in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society by Jim Kossin and Dan Vimont shows \u201cactive\u201d hurricane-season conditions on the left versus \u201cquiet\u201d on the right. The locations where tropical cyclones start are superimposed on maps of difference from average ocean temperature (colors) and wind shear (lines). Crosses show starting points for all storms that reached at least tropical storm strength. Circled crosses show starting points of storms that reached \u201cmajor hurricane\u201d strength, with peak winds of at least 111 mph (178 kph).\nOne can see that active hurricane seasons correspond to warmer waters (shaded yellow to red) and less wind shear (dashed contour lines) from 5oN to 25oN, while quiet years have opposite conditions along the same latitude belt. Additionally, busy seasons also have lowered surface pressure and a more moist, unstable atmosphere conducive for thunderstorm development; quiet years display higher pressures and a drier, more stable atmosphere. See also other related papers on the topic by Phil Klotzbach and Bill Gray in 2008\u2019s Journal of Climate and Shuo Li and colleagues in 2021\u2019s Journal of Climate.\nComparison of ocean temperature patterns, wind shear, and hurricane activity during the positive phase of the Atlantic Meridional Mode (left) and the negative phase (right). The positive phase brings warmer than average surface temperatures in the tropical Atlantic (orange and red) and lower than average wind shear (dashed contour lines), favoring more named storms (start locations marked with plus signs) and major hurricanes (circled plus signs).

Just over one quarter are absorbed by the ocean and just under 30% by land ecosystems \u2013 although there is considerable year-to-year variability in this because of naturally occurring phenomena like El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a.\nThe Greenhouse Gas Bulletin complements the UN Environment Programme\u2019s Emissions Gap report. Both were published ahead of COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan.\nDuring El Ni\u00f1o years, greenhouse gas levels tend to rise because drier vegetation and forest fires reduce the efficiency of land carbon sinks.\n\u201cThe Bulletin warns that we face a potential vicious cycle. Natural climate variability plays a big role in carbon cycle. But in the near future, climate change itself could cause ecosystems to become larger sources of greenhouse gases. Wildfires could release more carbon emissions into the atmosphere, whilst the warmer ocean might absorb less CO2. Consequently, more CO2 could stay in the atmosphere to accelerate global warming. These climate feedbacks are critical concerns to human society,\u201d said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Ko Barrett.\nFrom 1990 to 2023, radiative forcing \u2013 the warming effect on our climate - by long-lived greenhouse gases increased by 51.5%, with CO2 accounting for about 81% of this increase, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Annual Greenhouse Gas Index cited in the WMO Bulletin.\nAs long as emissions continue, greenhouse gases will continue accumulating in the atmosphere leading to global temperature rise. Given the extremely long life of CO2 in the atmosphere, the temperature level already observed will persist for several decades even if emissions are rapidly reduced to net zero.\nThe last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was 3-5 million years ago, when the temperature was 2-3\u00b0C warmer and sea level was 10-20 meters higher than now.\nCO2 is the single most important greenhouse gas in the atmosphere related to human activities, accounting for approximately 64% of the warming effect on the climate, mainly because of fossil fuel combustion and cement production.\nThe 2023 increase of CO2 in the atmosphere was higher than that of 2022, although lower than that of the three years before that. The annual increase of 2.3 ppm marked the 12th consecutive year with an increase greater than 2 ppm, while the increase within the year 2023 was one of the largest (2.8 ppm).\nThe long-term CO2 increase is due to fossil fuel combustion but there are year-to-year variations due to the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation, which impacts photosynthetic CO2 uptake, respiratory release, and fires. In May 2023, Earth transitioned from a 3-year long La Ni\u00f1a to El Ni\u00f1o.\nIn 2023, global fire carbon emissions were 16 % above average, seventh amongst all fire seasons since 2003. Canada experienced its worst wildfire season on record. Australia experienced its driest three-month period on record in 2023 from August to October, with severe bushfires.\nMethane is a powerful greenhouse gas which remains in the atmosphere for about a decade.\nMethane accounts for about 16% of the warming effect of long-lived greenhouse gases. Approximately 40% of methane is emitted into the atmosphere by natural sources (for example, wetlands and termites), and about 60% comes from anthropogenic sources (for example, ruminants, rice agriculture, fossil fuel exploitation, landfills and biomass burning).\nThe growth in atmospheric methane in 2023 was smaller than 2022 \u2013 but was record high for the five-year period. Detailed analysis indicates an emission increase from sources such as wetlands and agriculture, which could at least partly be due to on-going climate feedback that further increases greenhouse gas emissions from the natural systems.\nNitrous Oxide is both a powerful gree\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

But, thanks to improved early warnings and disaster management, the number of deaths decreased almost three-fold.\nAccording to the WMO Atlas of Mortality and Economic Losses from Weather, Climate and Water Extremes (1970 \u2013 2019), there were more than 11 000 reported disasters attributed to these hazards globally, with just over 2 million deaths and US$ 3.64 trillion in losses.\nThe report is the most comprehensive review of mortality and economic losses from weather, water and climate extremes to date. It assesses the entire 50-year period as well as by individual decade.\nFrom 1970 to 2019, weather, climate and water hazards accounted for 50% of all disasters, 45% of all reported deaths and 74% of all reported economic losses.\nMore than 91% of these deaths occurred in developing countries (using the United Nations Country Classification).\nOf the top 10 disasters, the hazards that led to the largest human losses during the period have been droughts (650 000 deaths), storms (577 232 deaths), floods (58 700 deaths) and extreme temperature (55 736 deaths).\nDeaths decreased almost threefold from 1970 to 2019. Death tolls fell from over 50 000 deaths in the 1970s to less than 20 000 in the 2010s. The 1970s and 1980s reported an average of 170 related deaths per day. In the 1990s, that average fell by one third to 90 related deaths per day, then continued to fall in the 2010s to 40 related deaths per day.\nWith regard to economic losses, the top 10 events include storms (US$ 521 billion) and floods (US$ 115 billion).\nDuring the 50-year period, US$ 202 million dollars in damage occurred on average every day. Economic losses have increased sevenfold from the 1970s to the 2010s. The reported losses from 2010\u20132019 (US$ 383 million per day on average over the decade) were seven times the amount reported from 1970\u20131979 (US$ 49 million). Storms were the most prevalent cause of damage, resulting in the largest economic losses around the globe. It is the sole hazard for which the attributed portion is continually increasing.\nThree of the costliest 10 disasters occurred in 2017: Hurricanes Harvey (US$ 96.9 billion), Maria (US$ 69.4 billion) and Irma (US$ 58.2 billion). These three hurricanes alone accounted for 35% of the total economic losses of the top 10 disasters around the world from 1970 to 2019.\n\u201cThe number of weather, climate and water extremes are increasing and will become more frequent and severe in many parts of the world as a result of climate change,\u201d says WMO Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas.\n\u201cThat means more heatwaves, drought and forest fires such as those we have observed recently in Europe and North America. We have more water vapor in the atmosphere, which is exacerbating extreme rainfall and deadly flooding. The warming of the oceans has affected the frequency and area of existence of the most intense tropical storms,\u201d he comments.\n\u201cEconomic losses are mounting as exposure increases. But, behind the stark statistics, lies a message of hope. Improved multi-hazard early warning systems have led to a significant reduction in mortality. Quite simply, we are better than ever before at saving lives,\u201d according to Prof. Taalas.\nBut much more remains to be done. Only half of the 193 members of WMO have multi-hazard early warning systems and there are severe gaps in weather and hydrological observing networks in Africa, some parts of Latin America and in Pacific and Caribbean island states.\nWMO is strengthening collaboration with its partners to address risks associated with weather, climate and water extremes. The UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, which moves into WMO headquarters in Geneva on 1 September, and the World Health Organization contributed to the WMO Atlas.\n\u201cMore lives are being saved thanks to early warning systems but it is also true that the number of people exposed to disaster risk is increasing due t\u00e5o population growth in hazard-exposed areas and the growing intensity and frequency of weather events. More international cooperation is needed to tackle the chronic problem of huge numbers of people being displaced each year by floods, storms and drought. We need greater investment in comprehensive disaster risk management ensuring that climate change adaptation is integrated in national and local disaster risk reduction strategies,\u201d said Mami Mizutori, Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction and Head of UNDRR.\n\u201cThe overlap of the COVID-19 pandemic with many other natural and manmade hazards, especially extreme weather events during the last 18 months demonstrates the need for greater investment in disaster risk reduction and a multi-hazard approach to disaster risk management and early warning systems to reduce risks and strengthen preparedness for multiple disaster scenarios,\u201d she said.\nTo highlight impacts of specific weather, climate and water hazards, the report disaggregates the data to the disaster subtype and sub-subtype and provides a regional breakdown. This is intended to inform policy development and decision-making to protect lives and livelihoods and to strengthen standards in loss accounting and related disaster databases.\nStatistics in the WMO Atlas are from the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) maintained by the Centre for Research on the Epid\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This involves a careful analysis of observations, data quality, and modeling results.\nAs discussed in the previous blog post, when looking for evidence of climate change in past records of hurricanes and tropical storms, one has to account for \u201cmissing\u201d tropical systems that occurred in the past but were not recorded due to lack of satellite imagery. For example, the figure below\u2014from a new study by the authors and colleagues (Vecchi et al. in 2021\u2019s Nature Communications)\u2014provides a best estimate of how many hurricanes occurred over the North Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, and Gulf of Mexico back to the 1850s, including an estimate of \u201cmissing\u201d storms.\n(red line) An estimate of the number of tropical cyclones in the Atlantic basin (15-year running average) that were likely missed early in the historical record due to sparse observations.

(2021) study, with the red shading showing the uncertainty in those estimates. The blue line is the total number of hurricanes (both observed and estimated missed) in a centered 15-year average, derived from the years 1851-2019, with the blue shading showing the uncertainty. The dark and light gray shadings before 1900 provide a caution that this approach is more uncertain during the 19th Century than the 20th Century for estimating the total number of hurricanes per year.\nThe graph shows distinctly busy and quiet periods: higher hurricane numbers in the late 19th century, mid-20th century, and from the mid-1990s onward, but lower numbers in the early 20th century, and in the 1970s to early-1990s. It\u2019s also worth pointing out that there is no significant trend upward in the estimated total number of hurricanes. Chris also demonstrated (in 2015\u2019s Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society) that the number of hurricanes affecting the U.S. (with no adjustments required) shows no significant trend since 1900, in agreement with the Vecchi et al. basin-wide estimated reconstructions and with updated U.S. landfalling hurricane and major hurricane time series.\nThere is a good understanding of the environmental conditions that accompany these decade-to-decade swings in hurricane activity. For example, the depiction below from a 2007 paper in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society by Jim Kossin and Dan Vimont shows \u201cactive\u201d hurricane-season conditions on the left versus \u201cquiet\u201d on the right.

Death tolls fell from over 50 000 deaths in the 1970s to less than 20 000 in the 2010s. The 1970s and 1980s reported an average of 170 related deaths per day. In the 1990s, that average fell by one third to 90 related deaths per day, then continued to fall in the 2010s to 40 related deaths per day.\nWith regard to economic losses, the top 10 events include storms (US$ 521 billion) and floods (US$ 115 billion).\nDuring the 50-year period, US$ 202 million dollars in damage occurred on average every day. Economic losses have increased sevenfold from the 1970s to the 2010s. The reported losses from 2010\u20132019 (US$ 383 million per day on average over the decade) were seven times the amount reported from 1970\u20131979 (US$ 49 million). Storms were the most prevalent cause of damage, resulting in the largest economic losses around the globe. It is the sole hazard for which the attributed portion is continually increasing.\nThree of the costliest 10 disasters occurred in 2017: Hurricanes Harvey (US$ 96.9 billion), Maria (US$ 69.4 billion) and Irma (US$ 58.2 billion). These three hurricanes alone accounted for 35% of the total economic losses of the top 10 disasters around the world from 1970 to 2019.\n\u201cThe number of weather, climate and water extremes are increasing and will become more frequent and severe in many parts of the world as a result of climate change,\u201d says WMO Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas.\n\u201cThat means more heatwaves, drought and forest fires such as those we have observed recently in Europe and North America. We have more water vapor in the atmosphere, which is exacerbating extreme rainfall and deadly flooding. The warming of the oceans has affected the frequency and area of existence of the most intense tropical storms,\u201d he comments.\n\u201cEconomic losses are mounting as exposure increases. But, behind the stark statistics, lies a message of hope. Improved multi-hazard early warning systems have led to a significant reduction in mortality. Quite simply, we are better than ever before at saving lives,\u201d according to Prof. Taalas.\nBut much more remains to be done. Only half of the 193 members of WMO have multi-hazard early warning systems and there are severe gaps in weather and hydrological observing networks in Africa, some parts of Latin America and in Pacific and Caribbean island states.\nWMO is strengthening collaboration with its partners to address risks associated with weather, climate and water extremes. The UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, which moves into WMO headquarters in Geneva on 1 September, and the World Health Organization contributed to the WMO Atlas.\n\u201cMore lives are being saved thanks to early warning systems but it is also true that the number of people exposed to disaster risk is increasing due t\u00e5o population growth in hazard-exposed areas and the growing intensity and frequency of weather events. More international cooperation is needed to tackle the chronic problem of huge numbers of people being displaced each year by floods, storms and drought. We need greater investment in comprehensive disaster risk management ensuring that climate change adaptation is integrated in national and local disaster risk reduction strategies,\u201d said Mami Mizutori, Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction and Head of UNDRR.\n\u201cThe overlap of the COVID-19 pandemic with many other natural and manmade hazards, especially extreme weather events during the last 18 months demonstrates the need for greater investment in disaster risk reduction and a multi-hazard approach to disaster risk management and early warning systems to reduce risks and strengthen preparedness for multiple disaster scenarios,\u201d she said.\nTo highlight impacts of specific weather, climate and water hazards, the report disaggregates the data to the disaster subtype and sub-subtype and provides a regional breakdown. This is intended to inform policy development and decision-making to protect lives and livelihoods and to strengthen standards in loss accounting and related disaster databases.\nStatistics in the WMO Atlas are from the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) maintained by the Centre for Research on the Epid\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech \u203a Larger view\nThe Greenland Ice Sheet is rapidly melting, having lost 3.8 trillion tons of ice between 1992 and 2018, a new study from NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) finds. The study combined 26 independent satellite datasets to track global warming's effect on Greenland, one of the largest ice sheets on Earth, and the ice sheet melt's impact on rising sea levels. The findings, which forecast an approximate 3 to 5 inches (70 to 130 millimeters) of global sea level rise by 2100, are in alignment with previous worst-case projections if the average rate of Greenland's ice loss continues.\nChanges to the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are of considerable societal importance, as they directly impact global sea levels, which are a result of climate change. As glaciers and ice sheets melt, they add more water to the ocean. Increasing rates of global warming have accelerated Greenland's ice mass loss from 25 billion tons per year in the 1990s to a current average of 234 billion tons per year. This means that Greenland's ice is melting on average seven times faster today than it was at the beginning of the study period. The Greenland Ice Sheet holds enough water to raise the sea level by 24 feet (7.4 meters).\nThe paper, published Dec. 10 in Nature, is the result of an international collaboration between 89 polar scientists from 50 scientific institutions supported by NASA and ESA. The Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise, or IMBIE, used well-calibrated data from 13 NASA and ESA satellite missions to create the most accurate measurements of ice loss to date. The team found that half of the loss is tied to surface ice melting in warmer air. The rest of the loss is the result of factors such as warmer ocean temperatures, iceberg calving and the ice sheet shedding ice into the ocean more quickly.\n\"There are climate projections that are based on models of varying levels of complexity and observations, but they have large uncertainties. Our study is purely an observational one that tests those uncertainties. Therefore, we have irrefutable evidence that we seem to be on track with one of the most pessimistic sea level rise scenarios,\" said Erik Ivins, second author and lead scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.\nGreenland is home to the only permanent ice sheet outside Antarctica. The sheet covers three-fourths of Greenland's land mass. But in the last 26 years, Greenland's melting ice has added 0.4 inches (11 millimeters) to sea level rise. Its cumulative 3.8 trillion tons of melted ice is equivalent to adding the water from 120 million Olympic-size swimming pools to the ocean every year, for 26 years.\n\"As a rule of thumb, for every centimeter rise in global sea level, another 6 million people are exposed to coastal flooding around the planet,\" said Andrew Shepherd, lead author and scientist from the University of Leeds in the United Kingdom. \"On current trends, Greenland ice melting will cause 100 million people to be flooded each year by the end of the century, so 400 million in total due to sea level rise.\"\nIn addition to storm surges and high tides that will increase flooding in many regions, sea level rise exacerbates events like hurricanes. Greenland's shrinking ice sheet also speeds up global warming. The vast expanse of snow and ice helps cool down Earth by reflecting the Sun's rays back into space. As the ice melts and retreats, the region absorbs more solar radiation, which warms the planet.\nThe new study will contribute to the evaluation and evolution of sea level rise models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in evaluating risks to current and future populations. The results of the study currently appear consistent with the panel's worst-case projections for sea level rise in the next 80 years.\n\"The full set of consequences of future melt from the Greenland Ice Sheet remain uncertain, but even a small increase in sea level can have devastating effects on ports and coastal zones, cause destructive erosion, wetland flooding, and aquifer and agricultural soil contamination with salt,\" said Ivins.\nThis is the third IMBIE study on ice loss as a result of global warming. IMBIE's first report in 2012 measured both Greenland and Antarctica's shrinking ice sheets, finding that the combined ice losses from Antarctica and Greenland had increased over time and that the ice sheets were losing three times as much ice as they were in the early 1990s. Antarctica and Greenland continue to lose ice today, and that rate of loss has accelerated since the first IMBIE study.\nIMBIE is supported by the NASA Earth Science Division and the ESA Climate Change Initiative.\nTo learn more about NASA missions studying climate change, visit:\nhttps://climate.nasa.gov\nTo learn more about NASA's study of sea level rise, visit:\nhttps://sealevel.nasa.gov\nView the latest sea level data in Earth Now:\nhttps://go.nasa.gov/341j5aV\nArielle Samuelson Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. 818-354-0307 arielle.a.samuelson@jpl.nasa.gov\nSite Manager: Carmen Blackwood NASA Responsible Official: Doug Newman\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

As the ice melts into the ocean, it raises the sea level around the world, causing flooding and other damage to coastal communities. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech \u203a Larger view\nThe Greenland Ice Sheet is rapidly melting, having lost 3.8 trillion tons of ice between 1992 and 2018, a new study from NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) finds. The study combined 26 independent satellite datasets to track global warming's effect on Greenland, one of the largest ice sheets on Earth, and the ice sheet melt's impact on rising sea levels. The findings, which forecast an approximate 3 to 5 inches (70 to 130 millimeters) of global sea level rise by 2100, are in alignment with previous worst-case projections if the average rate of Greenland's ice loss continues.\nChanges to the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are of considerable societal importance, as they directly impact global sea levels, which are a result of climate change. As glaciers and ice sheets melt, they add more water to the ocean. Increasing rates of global warming have accelerated Greenland's ice mass loss from 25 billion tons per year in the 1990s to a current average of 234 billion tons per year. This means that Greenland's ice is melting on average seven times faster today than it was at the beginning of the study period. The Greenland Ice Sheet holds enough water to raise the sea level by 24 feet (7.4 meters).\nThe paper, published Dec. 10 in Nature, is the result of an international collaboration between 89 polar scientists from 50 scientific institutions supported by NASA and ESA. The Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise, or IMBIE, used well-calibrated data from 13 NASA and ESA satellite missions to create the most accurate measurements of ice loss to date. The team found that half of the loss is tied to surface ice melting in warmer air. The rest of the loss is the result of factors such as warmer ocean temperatures, iceberg calving and the ice sheet shedding ice into the ocean more quickly.\n\"There are climate projections that are based on models of varying levels of complexity and observations, but they have large uncertainties. Our study is purely an observational one that tests those uncertainties. Therefore, we have irrefutable evidence that we seem to be on track with one of the most pessimistic sea level rise scenarios,\" said Erik Ivins, second author and lead scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.\nGreenland is home to the only permanent ice sheet outside Antarctica. The sheet covers three-fourths of Greenland's land mass. But in the last 26 years, Greenland's melting ice has added 0.4 inches (11 millimeters) to sea level rise. Its cumulative 3.8 trillion tons of melted ice is equivalent to adding the water from 120 million Olympic-size swimming pools to the ocean every year, for 26 years.\n\"As a rule of thumb, for every centimeter rise in global sea level, another 6 million people are exposed to coastal flooding around the planet,\" said Andrew Shepherd, lead author and scientist from the University of Leeds in the United Kingdom. \"On current trends, Greenland ice melting will cause 100 million people to be flooded each year by the end of the century, so 400 million in total due to sea level rise.\"\nIn addition to storm surges and high tides that will increase flooding in many regions, sea level rise exacerbates events like hurricanes. Greenland's shrinking ice sheet also speeds up global warming. The vast expanse of snow and ice helps cool down Earth by reflecting the Sun's rays back into space. As the ice melts and retreats, the region absorbs more solar radiation, which warms the planet.\nThe new study will contribute to the evaluation and evolution of sea level rise models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in evaluating risks to current and future populations. The results of the study currently appear consistent with the panel's worst-case projections for sea level rise in the next 80 years.\n\"The full set of consequences of future melt from the Greenland Ice Sheet remain uncertain, but even a small increase in sea level can have devastating effects on ports and coastal zones, cause destructive erosion, wetland flooding, and aquifer and agricultural soil contamination with salt,\" said Ivins.\nThis is the third IMBIE study on ice loss as a result of global warming. IMBIE's first report in 2012 measured both Greenland and Antarctica's shrinking ice sheets, finding that the combined ice losses from Antarctica and Greenland had increased over time and that the ice sheets were losing three times as much ice as they were in the early 1990s. Antarctica and Greenland continue to lose ice today, and that rate of loss has accelerated since the first IMBIE study.\nIMBIE is supported by the NASA Earth Science Division and the ESA Climate Change Initiative.\nTo learn more about NASA missions studying climate change, visit:\nhttps://climate.nasa.gov\nTo learn more about NASA's study of sea level rise, visit:\nhttps://sealevel.nasa.gov\nView the latest sea level data in Earth Now:\nhttps://go.nasa.gov/341j5aV\nArielle Samuelson Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. 818-354-0307 arielle.a.samuelson@jpl.nasa.gov\nSite Manager: Carmen Blackwood NASA Responsible Official: Doug Newman\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This paper has three goals. First, it provides background on the climate crisis, the role of human behavior in creating this crisis, and the health impacts of climate change. Second, it proposes a multilevel, translational approach to investigating health behavior change in the context of the climate crisis. Third, it identifies specific challenges and opportunities for increasing the rigor of behavioral medicine research in the context of the climate crisis. The paper closes with a call for behavioral medicine to be responsive to the climate crisis.\nKeywords: Behavioral medicine, Climate change, Global warming, Anthropocene, Mitigation, Adaptation, Health co-benefits\nClimate change is transforming the planet and, consequently, exacerbating threats to human health. This paper offers a framework for remaking behavioral medicine research to address climate change and its impacts.\nPractice: Instilling a sense of connection, promoting empathy, and developing a vision for humankind as interdependent must be a priority if we are to foster the kinds of behaviors\u2014individually and collectively\u2014that will promote planetary health.\nPolicy: Ultimately, the goals of our work as behavioral medicine researchers, practitioners, and policy makers, in response to the crises resulting from climate change, must be to redefine individual health and health behaviors as part of planetary health, with a priority on identifying how to motivate individuals to see themselves as part of humankind and take collective action.\nResearch: Priorities for a behavioral medicine research agenda include (1) promoting behavior changes to facilitate planetary health, (2) identifying and developing behavioral interventions at multiple levels\u2014from the individual to systems-level\u2014to facilitate climate-resilient health behaviors, and (3) preparing ourselves and our patients for future shocks to physical, social, and health systems that will feel uncanny and alien.\nThe climate crisis (and its attendant mass extinctions and ecological breakdown) is the most complex and consequential challenge humans have ever faced [1]. For the past 10,000 years, Earth has experienced an incredibly stable temperature, which yielded predictable seasons, favorable conditions for agriculture and complex social systems, and enough consistency in the frequency and intensity of \u201cnatural\u201d threats to allow for reliable infrastructure development. Because nature was predictable, we were able to develop technologies, cities, economies, and other markers of civilization that allowed many of us to ignore it. That period, because it was so odd in geographical terms, was given a name: the Holocene. We had long assumed that this stability was the only and natural state of Earth\u2019s systems, but we now know that burning fossil fuels for energy has caused many of Earth\u2019s systems to change radically [2\u20135].\nWe now live in the Anthropocene, an era of hotter temperatures and more variable weather conditions (as well as other human-caused changes to natural systems) that threaten human lives and the continuity of human civilizations.

Wildfires blaze through vast swaths of forest in the American West and across Canada, releasing smoke that drifts thousands of miles and casts an eerie orange glow over East Coast cities.\nThe same stubborn atmospheric patterns that feed these infernos also blanket urban centers like Philadelphia in relentless, punishing heat. Heat domes settle over concrete corridors\u2014especially in low-income neighborhoods with limited green space\u2014turning row homes, buses, and sidewalks into sweltering hazards.\nPresidential Distinguished Professor in Penn\u2019s Department of Earth and Environmental Science Michael E. Mann, postdoctoral researcher Xueke Li, and other researchers offer fresh insight into the atmospheric mechanics behind these extremes\u2014and troubling evidence that they\u2019re becoming more common.\nPublished in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , the paper shows that a specific and destructive jet stream behavior, known as quasi-resonant amplification (QRA), is happening more frequently and is tightly linked to human-caused climate change.\nMichael Wehner, a senior scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and co-author on the study, notes that while the thermodynamic effects of climate change\u2014such as increased temperatures\u2014are well understood, \u201cthe effects of climate change on the dynamical processes that cause certain types of extreme weather is a more difficult problem. This paper detects an important change in one of these complex aspects of atmospheric motion.\u201d\nQRA occurs when large, slow-moving planetary waves in the jet stream\u2014a high-altitude air current that guides weather systems\u2014intensify and become stalled, Li explains. This \u201ctrapping\u201d effect causes weather such as heat domes or rainstorms to remain over one region. \u201cThis resonance increases the waves\u2019 strength and persistence, often leading to extended extreme weather,\u201d Li says\nThe team previously studied the 2021 Pacific Northwest heat dome, one of the most extreme heat events on record. Their analysis traced that event to QRA dynamics that amplified a planetary wave and dried out regional soils, which in turn fed extreme surface warming.\n\u201cThis latest study builds on that by providing the first observational evidence that such QRA events are becoming more frequent in a warming climate,\u201d Mann says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s the first study to demonstrate a historical increase, taking advantage of the more reliable atmospheric \u2018reanalysis\u2019 observations that are available today.\u201d\nThe observed rise in QRA events, Mann notes, isn\u2019t due solely to more powerful waves, but to the rare alignment of two necessary conditions: wave amplitude and wave phase.\n\u201cFor a QRA event to occur,\u201d he explains, \u201chigh-amplitude waves must also be in just the right phase, meaning they are positioned in the atmosphere in a way that allows them to become trapped and resonate. Without that precise alignment, even strongly amplified waves may simply move along and fail to lock into place.\u201d\nLi adds that the trend is closely tied to \u201cpolar amplification of warming and increased land/ocean thermal contrast,\u201d both of which can be tied to the pattern of human-caused warming.\n\u201cThe burning of fossil fuels has released vast amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, driving global temperatures higher,\u201d Li says. \u201cBut the impact doesn\u2019t stop there. Human-induced warming is also modulating the jet stream and other circulation systems, making extreme weather events more frequent, persistent, and severe.\u201d\nTo identify QRA events, scientists look for specific patterns in the jet stream.\nMann and Li, for example, detect planetary wave resonance by examining specific atmospheric conditions that favor the trapping of certain large-scale waves in the jet stream; this creates the potential for those waves to resonate and become amplified. To confirm a resonance event, they use spectral analysis, a technique that breaks down the atmosphere\u2019s wave structure into distinct components, like a song into notes This allows the researchers to isolate the relevant waves\u2014typically those that circle the globe six to eight times\u2014and track their strength and duration over time.\nDespite the growing frequency and impact of these events, current climate models don\u2019t fully capture them.\n\u201cPart of why this is so significant is that the current-generation climate models do not do a good job in capturing this phenomenon,\u201d Li says. \u201cAnd this means that the models are likely underestimating the potential for increase in these sorts of damaging and deadly summer weather extremes.\u201d\nOne additional layer of complexity comes from the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a tropical Pacific phenomenon that affects global atmospheric conditions.\n\u201cDuring ENSO events, shifts in heat and convection across the tropical Pacific ripple outward, altering the structure and strength of the jet stream,\u201d Li says.\nThese changes can create atmospheric conditions that either favor or suppress the trapping and amplification of planetary waves. ENSO acts more like a background conductor, subtly influencing the broader atmospheric state in which planetary wave resonance may occur, explains Li.\nWhile the relationship is complex and not always immediate, researchers have found that the most active QRA years often follow a peak of major El Ni\u00f1o events, suggesting a delayed but influential connection that scientists are still working to fully understand.\nTo better capture that nuance, Mann and Li say future work will focus on next-generation, higher-resolution models.\n\u201cBy testing these advanced models,\u201d adds Li, \u201cwe are also better positioned to develop a more comprehensive mechanistic understanding of how ENSO interacts with QRA\u2014an important and still evolving area of research.\u201d\nMichae E.

The extreme heat of that era \u2014 which had a chance of ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nWe need to examine long-term data to understand how climate change is affecting weather extremes such as rainfall patterns, droughts, hurricanes, and heat waves.\nWeather fluctuates a lot from year to year, so looking at changes over five or even ten years does not give us a particularly strong signal about whether these events are becoming more frequent or more intense. We need data over decades.\nUnfortunately, many countries don\u2019t have complete data that stretches so far back in time. One country that does is the United States.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) publishes data for many metrics going back to the 1850s. The Environment Protection Agency tracks and publishes these climate indicators.\nOn this page, you will find charts for many of the most important measures of change: hurricane frequency and intensity, temperature anomalies and heat waves, extreme rainfall patterns, and drought.\nThis data is updated annually, following the latest release from the US EPA.\nThe most obvious and direct impact of recent climate change is rising temperatures.\nNOAA measures temperature anomalies in the US over time. A temperature anomaly tells us the difference between the recorded temperature and the historical average. In this case, the anomaly is measured relative to the average temperature over the 20th century (1901 to 2000). So if the anomaly in 2023 was 2\u00b0F, this means the temperature was 2\u00b0F warmer than the average in the 20th century.\nIn the chart below, you can see the anomaly in the US across different seasons. While temperatures vary a lot from year to year, you can see a clear warming trend across all seasons.\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that warming is not equal across the year. Minimum temperatures have increased faster than maximum temperatures. That means winter has warmed much faster than summer. And there has been a larger increase in nighttime temperatures compared to daytime.\nThis seasonal variation is important. More warming in winter greatly affects the amount of snow that falls, the water runoff from snowmelt, glacial melt, and the freezing of lakes. Spring has also warmed faster than summer, which can increase the length of the growing season. That\u2019s why you can see earlier peaks in cherry blossoms in many parts of the world.\nIt\u2019s not that US summers aren\u2019t getting warmer \u2014 they are \u2014 it\u2019s just that winters seem to be warming slightly faster. From the chart below, we can see that maximum summer temperatures are increasing. It shows the share of the US land that experiences \u201cunusually high\u201d summer temperatures in a given year.\n\u201cUnusually high\u201d means it has maximum temperatures among the warmest 10% of years since the early 1900s. Over the last few decades, you can see a distinct rise in the share of US land that has recorded these temperatures. Note the \u201cDust Bowl\u201d event in the 1930s, which also brought record summer temperatures to the US.\nAs we saw earlier, winters are getting much warmer.\nThe chart below shows the share of the US land with \u201cunusually low\u201d winter temperatures. Again, these are when minimum temperatures are among the coldest 10% since the early 1900s.\nYou can see a distinct downward trend. Although there is some annual variation, very few winters in the 21st century have seen record lows.\nFinally, we can look at heat waves. Here, a heatwave is defined as a period lasting at least four days during which the average temperature is a level that would only be expected to occur once every 10 years based on the historical record. In other words, it is an extended period of very high temperatures that would be expected only once per decade.\nThe \u201cHeat Wave Index\u201d is an indicator that summarizes the frequency and extent of heat waves. The higher the score, the more often they occur, and the more widespread they are. This next chart shows the index's annual value since 1895.\nThe most striking feature is the extreme heat waves during the \u201cDust Bowl\u201d event in the 1930s. This marked acute periods of extreme heat \u2013 at the far end of the temperature distribution. This was caused by poor land management and intense drought, which reduced levels of evaporation from soils.\nThe US EPA notes that the frequency of heatwaves and length of the season has increased since the 1960s.\nBecause warm air tends to hold more water, climate change can also increase the frequency of heavy rainfall in some regions.\nThe chart below shows the share of US land that experiences \u201cunusually high\u201d precipitation. That means a given year saw more rainfall than expected based on historical data.\nYou can see that while there\u2019s a lot of year-to-year variability, the rolling 9-year average has been rising since the early 2000s.\nThis can also be measured based on extreme one-day precipitation events. This is when a region experiences lots of rainfall on a single day.\nThe chart below shows the share of US land that experiences one of these extreme events each year. This typically goes through 5-to-10-year cycles, but it appears to have been rising slowly in recent decades.\nAnother extreme weather event is drought. Warmer summers, particularly, can lead to extended periods of very dry conditions.\nThe chart below shows the \u201cPalmer Drought Severity Index.\u201d Positive values mean wetter conditions than average, while negative values mean drier conditions.\nYou can see large cycles of wetter and drier conditions. Again, the stand-out event was the \u201cDust Bowl\u201d of the 1930s, an extended extreme drought that severely impacted agriculture.\nWe send two regular newsletters so you can stay up to date on our work and receive curated highlights from across Our World in Data.\nHurricanes are tropical cyclones that originate in the Atlantic Ocean. They are some of the most destructive and deadly disaster events.\nHurricanes are measured using the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. It categorizes hurricanes from 1 to 5 based on their maximum wind speeds. The higher the number, the more damaging it is. A \u201cm\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

For the past 10,000 years, Earth has experienced an incredibly stable temperature, which yielded predictable seasons, favorable conditions for agriculture and complex social systems, and enough consistency in the frequency and intensity of \u201cnatural\u201d threats to allow for reliable infrastructure development. Because nature was predictable, we were able to develop technologies, cities, economies, and other markers of civilization that allowed many of us to ignore it. That period, because it was so odd in geographical terms, was given a name: the Holocene. We had long assumed that this stability was the only and natural state of Earth\u2019s systems, but we now know that burning fossil fuels for energy has caused many of Earth\u2019s systems to change radically [2\u20135].\nWe now live in the Anthropocene, an era of hotter temperatures and more variable weather conditions (as well as other human-caused changes to natural systems) that threaten human lives and the continuity of human civilizations. The past 7 years were the hottest ever recorded globally, and we are unlikely to enjoy such cool conditions again, because most or all of the years in the next decade will continue to shatter record high temperatures [6]. Indeed, paleoclimatologists have consulted the geologic record for past eras that could serve as analogs for Earth\u2019s near-future state, and found that, by the 2030s, the mid-Pliocene (3.3\u20133 million years ago) was the closest match [7]. The mid-Pliocene era is the most recent period with atmospheric CO2 comparable with the present (ca. 400 ppm), with mean annual surface temperatures approximately 1.8\u00b0C\u20133.6\u00b0C warmer than preindustrial temperatures (i.e., 1,850\u20131,900), reduced ice sheet extents, and increased sea levels. Just as pre-Holocene Earth was inhospitable to human life, we now face accelerating risk of a rapid, irreversible return to a state of extreme instability and unpredictability across many Earth systems simultaneously [8]. Although every living species has an ancestor that survived the mid-Pliocene, past global warming/cooling took place over millennia. No species has faced the unprecedented speed at which anthropogenic warming is occurring [9]. Scientific estimates of the year in which mean local climate conditions will fall outside of the range to which its human infrastructure and plants/animals have adapted (e.g., mean annual temperature exceed the highest previously observed temperature for the area, and do not return) fall between 2036 (for tropical regions with very low prior variance) and 2080 (for more variable areas, under optimistic emissions scenarios), with a global (optimistic emissions) date of 2069 [4].\nThe popular term for the thresholds in Earth\u2019s dynamic climate and ecological systems, past which rapid, consequential changes would make them inhospitable to humans, is \u201ctipping points\u201d [10].

Mann, postdoctoral researcher Xueke Li, and other researchers offer fresh insight into the atmospheric mechanics behind these extremes\u2014and troubling evidence that they\u2019re becoming more common.\nPublished in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , the paper shows that a specific and destructive jet stream behavior, known as quasi-resonant amplification (QRA), is happening more frequently and is tightly linked to human-caused climate change.\nMichael Wehner, a senior scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and co-author on the study, notes that while the thermodynamic effects of climate change\u2014such as increased temperatures\u2014are well understood, \u201cthe effects of climate change on the dynamical processes that cause certain types of extreme weather is a more difficult problem. This paper detects an important change in one of these complex aspects of atmospheric motion.\u201d\nQRA occurs when large, slow-moving planetary waves in the jet stream\u2014a high-altitude air current that guides weather systems\u2014intensify and become stalled, Li explains. This \u201ctrapping\u201d effect causes weather such as heat domes or rainstorms to remain over one region. \u201cThis resonance increases the waves\u2019 strength and persistence, often leading to extended extreme weather,\u201d Li says\nThe team previously studied the 2021 Pacific Northwest heat dome, one of the most extreme heat events on record. Their analysis traced that event to QRA dynamics that amplified a planetary wave and dried out regional soils, which in turn fed extreme surface warming.\n\u201cThis latest study builds on that by providing the first observational evidence that such QRA events are becoming more frequent in a warming climate,\u201d Mann says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s the first study to demonstrate a historical increase, taking advantage of the more reliable atmospheric \u2018reanalysis\u2019 observations that are available today.\u201d\nThe observed rise in QRA events, Mann notes, isn\u2019t due solely to more powerful waves, but to the rare alignment of two necessary conditions: wave amplitude and wave phase.\n\u201cFor a QRA event to occur,\u201d he explains, \u201chigh-amplitude waves must also be in just the right phase, meaning they are positioned in the atmosphere in a way that allows them to become trapped and resonate. Without that precise alignment, even strongly amplified waves may simply move along and fail to lock into place.\u201d\nLi adds that the trend is closely tied to \u201cpolar amplification of warming and increased land/ocean thermal contrast,\u201d both of which can be tied to the pattern of human-caused warming.\n\u201cThe burning of fossil fuels has released vast amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, driving global temperatures higher,\u201d Li says. \u201cBut the impact doesn\u2019t stop there. Human-induced warming is also modulating the jet stream and other circulation systems, making extreme weather events more frequent, persistent, and severe.\u201d\nTo identify QRA events, scientists look for specific patterns in the jet stream.\nMann and Li, for example, detect planetary wave resonance by examining specific atmospheric conditions that favor the trapping of certain large-scale waves in the jet stream; this creates the potential for those waves to resonate and become amplified. To confirm a resonance event, they use spectral analysis, a technique that breaks down the atmosphere\u2019s wave structure into distinct components, like a song into notes This allows the researchers to isolate the relevant waves\u2014typically those that circle the globe six to eight times\u2014and track their strength and duration over time.\nDespite the growing frequency and impact of these events, current climate models don\u2019t fully capture them.\n\u201cPart of why this is so significant is that the current-generation climate models do not do a good job in capturing this phenomenon,\u201d Li says. \u201cAnd this means that the models are likely underestimating the potential for increase in these sorts of damaging and deadly summer weather extremes.\u201d\nOne additional layer of complexity comes from the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a tropical Pacific phenomenon that affects global atmospheric conditions.\n\u201cDuring ENSO events, shifts in heat and convection across the tropical Pacific ripple outward, altering the structure and strength of the jet stream,\u201d Li says.\nThese changes can create atmospheric conditions that either favor or suppress the trapping and amplification of planetary waves. ENSO acts more like a background conductor, subtly influencing the broader atmospheric state in which planetary wave resonance may occur, explains Li.\nWhile the relationship is complex and not always immediate, researchers have found that the most active QRA years often follow a peak of major El Ni\u00f1o events, suggesting a delayed but influential connection that scientists are still working to fully understand.\nTo better capture that nuance, Mann and Li say future work will focus on next-generation, higher-resolution models.\n\u201cBy testing these advanced models,\u201d adds Li, \u201cwe are also better positioned to develop a more comprehensive mechanistic understanding of how ENSO interacts with QRA\u2014an important and still evolving area of research.\u201d\nMichae E.

Without that precise alignment, even strongly amplified waves may simply move along and fail to lock into place.\u201d\nLi adds that the trend is closely tied to \u201cpolar amplification of warming and increased land/ocean thermal contrast,\u201d both of which can be tied to the pattern of human-caused warming.\n\u201cThe burning of fossil fuels has released vast amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, driving global temperatures higher,\u201d Li says. \u201cBut the impact doesn\u2019t stop there. Human-induced warming is also modulating the jet stream and other circulation systems, making extreme weather events more frequent, persistent, and severe.\u201d\nTo identify QRA events, scientists look for specific patterns in the jet stream.\nMann and Li, for example, detect planetary wave resonance by examining specific atmospheric conditions that favor the trapping of certain large-scale waves in the jet stream; this creates the potential for those waves to resonate and become amplified. To confirm a resonance event, they use spectral analysis, a technique that breaks down the atmosphere\u2019s wave structure into distinct components, like a song into notes This allows the researchers to isolate the relevant waves\u2014typically those that circle the globe six to eight times\u2014and track their strength and duration over time.\nDespite the growing frequency and impact of these events, current climate models don\u2019t fully capture them.\n\u201cPart of why this is so significant is that the current-generation climate models do not do a good job in capturing this phenomenon,\u201d Li says. \u201cAnd this means that the models are likely underestimating the potential for increase in these sorts of damaging and deadly summer weather extremes.\u201d\nOne additional layer of complexity comes from the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a tropical Pacific phenomenon that affects global atmospheric conditions.\n\u201cDuring ENSO events, shifts in heat and convection across the tropical Pacific ripple outward, altering the structure and strength of the jet stream,\u201d Li says.\nThese changes can create atmospheric conditions that either favor or suppress the trapping and amplification of planetary waves. ENSO acts more like a background conductor, subtly influencing the broader atmospheric state in which planetary wave resonance may occur, explains Li.\nWhile the relationship is complex and not always immediate, researchers have found that the most active QRA years often follow a peak of major El Ni\u00f1o events, suggesting a delayed but influential connection that scientists are still working to fully understand.\nTo better capture that nuance, Mann and Li say future work will focus on next-generation, higher-resolution models.\n\u201cBy testing these advanced models,\u201d adds Li, \u201cwe are also better positioned to develop a more comprehensive mechanistic understanding of how ENSO interacts with QRA\u2014an important and still evolving area of research.\u201d\nMichae E.

This paper has three goals. First, it provides background on the climate crisis, the role of human behavior in creating this crisis, and the health impacts of climate change. Second, it proposes a multilevel, translational approach to investigating health behavior change in the context of the climate crisis. Third, it identifies specific challenges and opportunities for increasing the rigor of behavioral medicine research in the context of the climate crisis. The paper closes with a call for behavioral medicine to be responsive to the climate crisis.\nKeywords: Behavioral medicine, Climate change, Global warming, Anthropocene, Mitigation, Adaptation, Health co-benefits\nClimate change is transforming the planet and, consequently, exacerbating threats to human health. This paper offers a framework for remaking behavioral medicine research to address climate change and its impacts.\nPractice: Instilling a sense of connection, promoting empathy, and developing a vision for humankind as interdependent must be a priority if we are to foster the kinds of behaviors\u2014individually and collectively\u2014that will promote planetary health.\nPolicy: Ultimately, the goals of our work as behavioral medicine researchers, practitioners, and policy makers, in response to the crises resulting from climate change, must be to redefine individual health and health behaviors as part of planetary health, with a priority on identifying how to motivate individuals to see themselves as part of humankind and take collective action.\nResearch: Priorities for a behavioral medicine research agenda include (1) promoting behavior changes to facilitate planetary health, (2) identifying and developing behavioral interventions at multiple levels\u2014from the individual to systems-level\u2014to facilitate climate-resilient health behaviors, and (3) preparing ourselves and our patients for future shocks to physical, social, and health systems that will feel uncanny and alien.\nThe climate crisis (and its attendant mass extinctions and ecological breakdown) is the most complex and consequential challenge humans have ever faced [1]. For the past 10,000 years, Earth has experienced an incredibly stable temperature, which yielded predictable seasons, favorable conditions for agriculture and complex social systems, and enough consistency in the frequency and intensity of \u201cnatural\u201d threats to allow for reliable infrastructure development. Because nature was predictable, we were able to develop technologies, cities, economies, and other markers of civilization that allowed many of us to ignore it. That period, because it was so odd in geographical terms, was given a name: the Holocene. We had long assumed that this stability was the only and natural state of Earth\u2019s systems, but we now know that burning fossil fuels for energy has caused many of Earth\u2019s systems to change radically [2\u20135].\nWe now live in the Anthropocene, an era of hotter temperatures and more variable weather conditions (as well as other human-caused changes to natural systems) that threaten human lives and the continuity of human civilizations. The past 7 years were the hottest ever recorded globally, and we are unlikely to enjoy such cool conditions again, because most or all of the years in the next decade will continue to shatter record high temperatures [6]. Indeed, paleoclimatologists have consulted the geologic record for past eras that could serve as analogs for Earth\u2019s near-future state, and found that, by the 2030s, the mid-Pliocene (3.3\u20133 million years ago) was the closest match [7]. The mid-Pliocene era is the most recent period with atmospheric CO2 comparable with the present (ca. 400 ppm), with mean annual surface temperatures approximately 1.8\u00b0C\u20133.6\u00b0C warmer than preindustrial temperatures (i.e., 1,850\u20131,900), reduced ice sheet extents, and increased sea levels. Just as pre-Holocene Earth was inhospitable to human life, we now face accelerating risk of a rapid, irreversible return to a state of extreme instability and unpredictability across many Earth systems simultaneously [8]. Although every living species has an ancestor that survived the mid-Pliocene, past global warming/cooling took place over millennia. No species has faced the unprecedented speed at which anthropogenic warming is occurring [9]. Scientific estimates of the year in which mean local climate conditions will fall outside of the range to which its human infrastructure and plants/animals have adapted (e.g., mean annual temperature exceed the highest previously observed temperature for the area, and do not return) fall between 2036 (for tropical regions with very low prior variance) and 2080 (for more variable areas, under optimistic emissions scenarios), with a global (optimistic emissions) date of 2069 [4].\nThe popular term for the thresholds in Earth\u2019s dynamic climate and ecological systems, past which rapid, consequential changes would make them inhospitable to humans, is \u201ctipping points\u201d [10]. These tipping points are terrifying, because they signify shifts from the current, steadily worsening conditions according to well understood causal associations between human activity and environmental consequence, to nonlinear (runaway, cascading) changes of unknown speed and upper bound. Such changes could be locked in, and represent a transformative shift from a state in which human activity functions as a crucial protector of human civilization to one in which such activity instead contributes to destabilizing the planetary conditions on which we depend.\nThe first and most pressing example of human contributors to destabilizing the Earth systems that sustain our civilizations is global heating. Currently, the defining feature of modern civilizations is that they require massive energy use to maintain the unprecedented productivity and annual growt\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

We need data over decades.\nUnfortunately, many countries don\u2019t have complete data that stretches so far back in time. One country that does is the United States.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) publishes data for many metrics going back to the 1850s. The Environment Protection Agency tracks and publishes these climate indicators.\nOn this page, you will find charts for many of the most important measures of change: hurricane frequency and intensity, temperature anomalies and heat waves, extreme rainfall patterns, and drought.\nThis data is updated annually, following the latest release from the US EPA.\nThe most obvious and direct impact of recent climate change is rising temperatures.\nNOAA measures temperature anomalies in the US over time. A temperature anomaly tells us the difference between the recorded temperature and the historical average. In this case, the anomaly is measured relative to the average temperature over the 20th century (1901 to 2000). So if the anomaly in 2023 was 2\u00b0F, this means the temperature was 2\u00b0F warmer than the average in the 20th century.\nIn the chart below, you can see the anomaly in the US across different seasons. While temperatures vary a lot from year to year, you can see a clear warming trend across all seasons.\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that warming is not equal across the year. Minimum temperatures have increased faster than maximum temperatures. That means winter has warmed much faster than summer. And there has been a larger increase in nighttime temperatures compared to daytime.\nThis seasonal variation is important. More warming in winter greatly affects the amount of snow that falls, the water runoff from snowmelt, glacial melt, and the freezing of lakes. Spring has also warmed faster than summer, which can increase the length of the growing season. That\u2019s why you can see earlier peaks in cherry blossoms in many parts of the world.\nIt\u2019s not that US summers aren\u2019t getting warmer \u2014 they are \u2014 it\u2019s just that winters seem to be warming slightly faster. From the chart below, we can see that maximum summer temperatures are increasing. It shows the share of the US land that experiences \u201cunusually high\u201d summer temperatures in a given year.\n\u201cUnusually high\u201d means it has maximum temperatures among the warmest 10% of years since the early 1900s. Over the last few decades, you can see a distinct rise in the share of US land that has recorded these temperatures. Note the \u201cDust Bowl\u201d event in the 1930s, which also brought record summer temperatures to the US.\nAs we saw earlier, winters are getting much warmer.\nThe chart below shows the share of the US land with \u201cunusually low\u201d winter temperatures. Again, these are when minimum temperatures are among the coldest 10% since the early 1900s.\nYou can see a distinct downward trend. Although there is some annual variation, very few winters in the 21st century have seen record lows.\nFinally, we can look at heat waves. Here, a heatwave is defined as a period lasting at least four days during which the average temperature is a level that would only be expected to occur once every 10 years based on the historical record. In other words, it is an extended period of very high temperatures that would be expected only once per decade.\nThe \u201cHeat Wave Index\u201d is an indicator that summarizes the frequency and extent of heat waves. The higher the score, the more often they occur, and the more widespread they are. This next chart shows the index's annual value since 1895.\nThe most striking feature is the extreme heat waves during the \u201cDust Bowl\u201d event in the 1930s. This marked acute periods of extreme heat \u2013 at the far end of the temperature distribution. This was caused by poor land management and intense drought, which reduced levels of evaporation from soils.\nThe US EPA notes that the frequency of heatwaves and length of the season has increased since the 1960s.\nBecause warm air tends to hold more water, climate change can also increase the frequency of heavy rainfall in some regions.\nThe chart below shows the share of US land that experiences \u201cunusually high\u201d precipitation. That means a given year saw more rainfall than expected based on historical data.\nYou can see that while there\u2019s a lot of year-to-year variability, the rolling 9-year average has been rising since the early 2000s.\nThis can also be measured based on extreme one-day precipitation events. This is when a region experiences lots of rainfall on a single day.\nThe chart below shows the share of US land that experiences one of these extreme events each year. This typically goes through 5-to-10-year cycles, but it appears to have been rising slowly in recent decades.\nAnother extreme weather event is drought. Warmer summers, particularly, can lead to extended periods of very dry conditions.\nThe chart below shows the \u201cPalmer Drought Severity Index.\u201d Positive values mean wetter conditions than average, while negative values mean drier conditions.\nYou can see large cycles of wetter and drier conditions. Again, the stand-out event was the \u201cDust Bowl\u201d of the 1930s, an extended extreme drought that severely impacted agriculture.\nWe send two regular newsletters so you can stay up to date on our work and receive curated highlights from across Our World in Data.\nHurricanes are tropical cyclones that originate in the Atlantic Ocean. They are some of the most destructive and deadly disaster events.\nHurricanes are measured using the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. It categorizes hurricanes from 1 to 5 based on their maximum wind speeds. The higher the number, the more damaging it is. A \u201cm\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The last year to see a net gain of ice is still 1996.\n\nFull Page Content:\nA new, comprehensive analysis of satellite data finds that majority of glaciers on the landmass have retreated significantly.\nJakobshavn Isbrae, a glacier on Greenland\u2019s western coast shown in these satellite images, retreated significantly between 1985 (left) and 2022 (right), losing about 97 billion tons (88 billion metric tons) of ice. A recent study found that glacial retreat caused the Greenland Ice Sheet to lose one-fifth more mass than previously estimated. Credit: NASA/USGS\nThe Greenland Ice Sheet has shed about one-fifth more ice mass in the past four decades than previously estimated, researchers at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California reported in a new paper. The majority of glaciers on the landmass have retreated significantly, and icebergs are falling into the ocean at an accelerating rate. This additional ice loss has had only an indirect impact on sea levels, but could hold implications for ocean circulation in the future.\nPublished in Nature on Jan. 17, the analysis offers a comprehensive look at retreat around the edges of the entire ice sheet from 1985 to 2022, drawing from nearly a quarter million pieces of satellite data on glacier positions. Of the 207 glaciers in the study, 179 retreated significantly since 1985, 27 held steady, and one advanced slightly.\nZachariae Isstrom, a glacier in northeast Greenland, retreated significantly between 1999 (left) and 2022 (right) as icebergs broke off at an accelerating rate. A recent study found that it lost 176 billion tons (160 billion metric tons) of ice from 1985 to 2022. Credit: NASA/USGS\nMost of the ice loss came from below sea level, in fjords on Greenland\u2019s periphery. Once occupied by ancient glacial ice, many of these deep coastal valleys have filled with seawater \u2013 meaning the ice that broke off made little net contribution to sea level. But the loss likely accelerated the movement of ice flowing down from higher elevations, which in turn added to sea level rise.\n\u201cWhen the ice at the end of a glacier calves and retreats, it\u2019s like pulling the plug out of the fjord, which lets ice drain into the ocean faster,\u201d said Chad Greene, a glacier scientist at JPL and the study\u2019s lead author.\nGet the Latest JPL News\nFor decades researchers have studied the Greenland Ice Sheet\u2019s direct contributions to global sea level rise through ice flow and melting. Scientists participating in the international Ice sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise (IMBIE) estimated that the ice sheet had lost 5,390 billion tons (4,890 billion metric tons) between 1992 and 2020, adding about 0.531 inches (13.5 millimeters) to global mean sea level, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\nBut the IMBIE measurements do not account for ice lost due to the retreat of terminal glaciers along the edges of Greenland. (These glacier edges were already in the water, whether submerged or floating.) The new study quantifies this amount: For the 1985 to 2022 period in the new paper, the ice sheet was estimated to have lost about 1,140 billion tons (1,034 billion metric tons) \u2013 21% more mass lost than in the IMBIE assessment.\nAlthough it doesn\u2019t add to sea levels, the additional ice represents a significant influx of fresh water to the ocean.

The reason comes down to physics ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAncient air bubbles trapped in ice enable us to step back in time and see what Earth's atmosphere, and climate, were like in the distant past. They tell us that levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere are higher than they have been at any time in the past 400,000 years. During ice ages, CO2 levels were around 200 parts per million (ppm), and during the warmer interglacial periods, they hovered around 280 ppm (see fluctuations in the graph). In 2013, CO2 levels surpassed 400 ppm for the first time in recorded history. This recent relentless rise in CO2 shows a remarkably constant relationship with fossil-fuel burning, and can be well accounted for based on the simple premise that about 60 percent of fossil-fuel emissions stay in the air.\nToday, we stand on the threshold of a new geologic era, which some term the \"Anthropocene\", one where the climate is very different to the one our ancestors knew.\nIf fossil-fuel burning continues at a business-as-usual rate, such that humanity exhausts the reserves over the next few centuries, CO2 will continue to rise to levels of order of 1500 ppm. The atmosphere would then not return to pre-industrial levels even tens of thousands of years into the future. This graph not only conveys the scientific measurements, but it also underscores the fact that humans have a great capacity to change the climate and planet.\nYou can also find this graphic on our \u201cEvidence\u201d page.\nDec 1, 2023\nJPEG (427.92 KB)\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

GHG emissions must also rapidly and significantly be reduced in the near future and eventually eliminated to prevent the increasingly harmful impacts of climate change over the next several decades.\nThe average temperature across the United States (U.S.) has risen at an average rate of 0.16\u00b0F per decade since the beginning of the 20th century, increasing to an even faster rate of 0.31 to 0.54\u00b0F per decade since the 1970s. Some parts of the U.S., such as the west, Alaska, and Northeast region have experienced greater warming than the rest of the country.\nThe annual statewide average temperature in New York has warmed 3\u00b0F (0.6\u00b0F per decade) since 1970. The state's average temperatures are projected to rise by as much as another 3\u00b0F by 2080 with the greatest warming occurring in the northern parts of the state. Rising annual temperatures are already having widespread impacts on New York's communities and ecosystems and impacts are expected to increase. New York State's changing climate may no longer be able to support the types of plants, insects, and wildlife living in New York, particularly those in high-elevation regions like the Catskills and Adirondacks. As New York's temperatures increase, these species will extend their range north, impacting the industries and economies that depend on them such as fishing, hunting, and tourism.\nAcross the northeastern U.S., winters are warming faster than any other season. Over the last century, average winter temperatures have increased by approximately 3\u00b0F, spring temperatures by 2\u00b0F, and summer and fall temperatures by 1.4\u00b0F.\nIn New York, winters have warmed three times faster than summers. Warmer winter temperatures, with fewer days below freezing, are bringing more winter precipitation to New York as rain, less snow, reduced snow cover, and earlier spring snowmelt. Less snowfall and earlier snowmelt are already having and will continue to have increasing economic impacts on New York's winter recreation industry. Reduced snow cover will increase the vulnerability of certain plants that depend on snow for insulation, and wildlife that depend on snow for protection from predators during the winter. Less snowfall in the winter can also cause drier summer soil conditions, increasing the risk of wildfires. Lake effect snow will increase snowfall amounts in the next few decades for parts of New York State, as warmer winters continue to cause less ice cover on Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, and the Finger Lakes. However, lake-effect snow will eventually decrease with continued global warming, as temperatures below freezing in New York become less frequent and more winter precipitation falls as rain.\nWarmer winters in New York are also affecting the winter-spring season transition, impacting the timing of blooming for trees and flowers which migrating and hibernating wildlife depend on for food. Changes to the timing of the winter-spring transition can also impact agriculture by extending the length of the growing season, with the last frost of winter occurring earlier in the year. Although increasing the length of the growing season can have advantages, it can also impact the types of crops that can be grown, encourage invasive species, weed growth, and crop diseases, and increase demand for irrigation. Deciding on the right timing for late winter tapping of maple trees for producing maple syrup, a commercially important commodity for New York, is expected to become more difficult.\nShifting seasons can also impact natural ecosystems, plant productivity, and forest health. Warmer late-winter and early-spring temperatures can expand the geographic range and population size of invasive insect species that harm native vegetation, such as the emerald ash borer and southern pine beetle. Warmer winters also can extend the season for disease-carrying species like ticks and mosquitoes.\nExtreme Temperatures In addition to warmer average temperatures, recent decades have shown changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme temperature events, such as heat waves and cold waves. The frequency of cold waves has decreased across most of the United States over the last century, while the number and length of heat waves have been increasing each decade since the 1960s. The annual frequency and length of heat waves in New York State are expected to continue to increase.\nExtreme heat will have a greater impact on urban areas which have many heat-absorbing surfaces like roads, parking lots, and buildings, and few cooling green spaces and trees.

A recent study found that glacial retreat caused the Greenland Ice Sheet to lose one-fifth more mass than previously estimated. Credit: NASA/USGS\nThe Greenland Ice Sheet has shed about one-fifth more ice mass in the past four decades than previously estimated, researchers at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California reported in a new paper. The majority of glaciers on the landmass have retreated significantly, and icebergs are falling into the ocean at an accelerating rate. This additional ice loss has had only an indirect impact on sea levels, but could hold implications for ocean circulation in the future.\nPublished in Nature on Jan. 17, the analysis offers a comprehensive look at retreat around the edges of the entire ice sheet from 1985 to 2022, drawing from nearly a quarter million pieces of satellite data on glacier positions. Of the 207 glaciers in the study, 179 retreated significantly since 1985, 27 held steady, and one advanced slightly.\nZachariae Isstrom, a glacier in northeast Greenland, retreated significantly between 1999 (left) and 2022 (right) as icebergs broke off at an accelerating rate. A recent study found that it lost 176 billion tons (160 billion metric tons) of ice from 1985 to 2022. Credit: NASA/USGS\nMost of the ice loss came from below sea level, in fjords on Greenland\u2019s periphery. Once occupied by ancient glacial ice, many of these deep coastal valleys have filled with seawater \u2013 meaning the ice that broke off made little net contribution to sea level. But the loss likely accelerated the movement of ice flowing down from higher elevations, which in turn added to sea level rise.\n\u201cWhen the ice at the end of a glacier calves and retreats, it\u2019s like pulling the plug out of the fjord, which lets ice drain into the ocean faster,\u201d said Chad Greene, a glacier scientist at JPL and the study\u2019s lead author.\nGet the Latest JPL News\nFor decades researchers have studied the Greenland Ice Sheet\u2019s direct contributions to global sea level rise through ice flow and melting. Scientists participating in the international Ice sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise (IMBIE) estimated that the ice sheet had lost 5,390 billion tons (4,890 billion metric tons) between 1992 and 2020, adding about 0.531 inches (13.5 millimeters) to global mean sea level, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\nBut the IMBIE measurements do not account for ice lost due to the retreat of terminal glaciers along the edges of Greenland. (These glacier edges were already in the water, whether submerged or floating.) The new study quantifies this amount: For the 1985 to 2022 period in the new paper, the ice sheet was estimated to have lost about 1,140 billion tons (1,034 billion metric tons) \u2013 21% more mass lost than in the IMBIE assessment.\nAlthough it doesn\u2019t add to sea levels, the additional ice represents a significant influx of fresh water to the ocean. Recent studies have suggested that changes in the salinity of the North Atlantic Ocean from melting icebergs could weaken the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, part of the global \u201cconveyor belt\u201d of currents that transport heat and salt around the ocean. This could influence weather patterns worldwide, as well as affect ecosystems, the authors said.\nIcebergs have tumbled from Greenland\u2019s glaciers for thousands of years as part of a natural cycle that typically balanced glacier growth in the winter with melting and retreat in the summer. The new study finds that ice retreat has far outpaced growth throughout the 21st century.\nThe researchers also found that Greenland\u2019s ice extent remained relatively steady from 1985 to 2000, then started a marked recession that continues to this day.\nThe data showed a glacier in northeast Greenland called Zachariae Isstrom lost the most ice, dropping 176 billion tons (160 billion metric tons) of mass due to retreat. It was followed by Jakobshavn Isbrae on the western coast, which lost an estimated 97 billion tons (88 billion metric tons), and Humboldt Gletscher in the northwest, which lost 96 billion tons (87 billion metric tons).\nOnly one glacier, Qajuuttap Sermia in southern Greenland, experienced any growth over the study period, but its gains were too small to offset the losses from other glaciers.\nThe researchers also found that glaciers with the largest seasonal fluctuations in the position of their ice front experienced the greatest overall retreat. The correlation suggests the glaciers that are most sensitive to warming each summer will be most impacted by climate change in the coming decades.\nThe discovery of a large-scale pattern of glacier retreat and its link to glacier sensitivity on seasonal time scales was the result of a big-data synthesis that looks at all parts of the ice sheet over time, said JPL cryosphere scientist Alex Gardner, a co-author of the paper. Scientists drew from five publicly available datasets that cumulatively tracked the month-to-month positions of 236,328 glacier edges as detected, either manually or by computer algorithms, in images collected by optical and radar satellites.\n\u201cPreviously, we had bits and pieces \u2013 lots of local studies,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cBut what this study offers is a systematic and comprehensive view that has led to some pretty significant insights that we didn\u2019t have about the ice sheet before.\u201d\nAndrew Wang / Jane J.

Extreme heat will have a greater impact on urban areas ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of New York State.\nThe most recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from human activities are responsible for accelerating global warming and climate change. Higher temperatures, more frequent precipitation and storms, faster rates of ocean warming, and sea level rise are some of the key physical effects of climate change that are impacting communities and ecosystems around the world. Climate change impacts will continue to worsen as global temperatures and greenhouse gas emissions increase (see Climate Change webpage).\nNew York's Responding to Climate Change in New York State (ClimAID) report (2011, 2014) , the National Climate Assessment (2023), DEC Observed and Projected Climate Change in NYS (PDF), and other climate impact assessment reports show that a variety of climate change impacts have already been observed across the northeastern United States and in New York State. These climate change reports clearly show, based on scientific data, that significant climate change impacts are already occurring. People, plants and wildlife, and ecosystems are facing an uncertain future unless adequate actions are taken to adapt to climate change impacts already unfolding and expected to intensify over time. GHG emissions must also rapidly and significantly be reduced in the near future and eventually eliminated to prevent the increasingly harmful impacts of climate change over the next several decades.\nThe average temperature across the United States (U.S.) has risen at an average rate of 0.16\u00b0F per decade since the beginning of the 20th century, increasing to an even faster rate of 0.31 to 0.54\u00b0F per decade since the 1970s. Some parts of the U.S., such as the west, Alaska, and Northeast region have experienced greater warming than the rest of the country.\nThe annual statewide average temperature in New York has warmed 3\u00b0F (0.6\u00b0F per decade) since 1970. The state's average temperatures are projected to rise by as much as another 3\u00b0F by 2080 with the greatest warming occurring in the northern parts of the state. Rising annual temperatures are already having widespread impacts on New York's communities and ecosystems and impacts are expected to increase. New York State's changing climate may no longer be able to support the types of plants, insects, and wildlife living in New York, particularly those in high-elevation regions like the Catskills and Adirondacks. As New York's temperatures increase, these species will extend their range north, impacting the industries and economies that depend on them such as fishing, hunting, and tourism.\nAcross the northeastern U.S., winters are warming faster than any other season. Over the last century, average winter temperatures have increased by approximately 3\u00b0F, spring temperatures by 2\u00b0F, and summer and fall temperatures by 1.4\u00b0F.\nIn New York, winters have warmed three times faster than summers. Warmer winter temperatures, with fewer days below freezing, are bringing more winter precipitation to New York as rain, less snow, reduced snow cover, and earlier spring snowmelt. Less snowfall and earlier snowmelt are already having and will continue to have increasing economic impacts on New York's winter recreation industry. Reduced snow cover will increase the vulnerability of certain plants that depend on snow for insulation, and wildlife that depend on snow for protection from predators during the winter. Less snowfall in the winter can also cause drier summer soil conditions, increasing the risk of wildfires. Lake effect snow will increase snowfall amounts in the next few decades for parts of New York State, as warmer winters continue to cause less ice cover on Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, and the Finger Lakes. However, lake-effect snow will eventually decrease with continued global warming, as temperatures below freezing in New York become less frequent and more winter precipitation falls as rain.\nWarmer winters in New York are also affecting the winter-spring season transition, impacting the timing of blooming for trees and flowers which migrating and hibernating wildlife depend on for food. Changes to the timing of the winter-spring transition can also impact agriculture by extending the length of the growing season, with the last frost of winter occurring earlier in the year. Although increasing the length of the growing season can have advantages, it can also impact the types of crops that can be grown, encourage invasive species, weed growth, and crop diseases, and increase demand for irrigation. Deciding on the right timing for late winter tapping of maple trees for producing maple syrup, a commercially important commodity for New York, is expected to become more difficult.\nShifting seasons can also impact natural ecosystems, plant productivity, and forest health. Warmer late-winter and early-spring temperatures can expand the geographic range and population size of invasive insect species that harm native vegetation, such as the emerald ash borer and southern pine beetle. Warmer winters also can extend the season for disease-carrying species like ticks and mosquitoes.\nExtreme Temperatures In addition to warmer average temperatures, recent decades have shown changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme temperature events, such as heat waves and cold waves. The frequency of cold waves has decreased across most of the United States over the last century, while the number and length of heat waves have been increasing each decade since the 1960s. The annual frequency and length of heat waves in New York State are expected to continue to increase.\nExtreme heat will have a greater impact on urban areas which have many heat-absorbing surfaces like roads, parking lots, and buildings, and few cooling green spaces and trees. This \"heat island effect,\" when urban areas experience higher temperatures than the surrounding suburban or rural areas, increases the risk of h\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",
