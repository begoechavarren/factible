    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nThe nation's historical preservation group, is now suing the Trump administration over its plans to build a giant ballroom over at the white House. Back in October, the Trump administration quickly demolished the white House East Wing to make room for the ballroom for this project. Want to bring in CNN's Brian Todd? Brian, why is the National Trust taking this dramatic step? And this is a lengthy lawsuit. It's a lengthy lawsuit, Wolf, 47 pages. It was filed just moments ago. We have a copy of this lawsuit now to answer your question, Wolf. They are suing because they want this project halted, first and foremost. And they're suing because they said that the white House and its allies and in certain agencies like the National Park Service, did not get the necessary approvals or conduct the necessary reviews. We have a copy of this lawsuit. You see the pictures here. This has been what many people have been complaining about, the demolition of the East wing of the white House that began in October for the construction of a 90,000 square foot ballroom. And just moments ago, as Wolf mentioned, we've obtained a copy of this lawsuit from the National Trust for Historic Preservation. They are suing the National Park Service. They are suing President Trump himself, plus the National Park Service, plus the Department of the Interior and Interior Secretary Douglas Burgum, and others over the construction of the ballroom where the east wing and the colonnade used to be. And here is just one quote from one of the initial pages of the lawsuit. No president is legally allowed to tear down portions of the white House without any review whatsoever. Not President Trump, not President Biden, and not anyone else. And no president is legally allowed to construct a ballroom on public property without giving the public the opportunity to weigh in. President Trump's efforts to do so should be immediately halted, and work on the ballroom project should be paused until the defendants complete the required reviews. Reviews that should have taken place before the defendants demolish the East Wing and before they began construction of the ballroom and secured the necessary approvals. What they are also saying is that there are two entities, from which the white House needed to seek approval and at least a review of this project. The National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts. And according to this lawsuit from the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the white House did not seek any review from those agencies and did not seek any, public, input on this project. Now, I can I can tell you also, Wolf, we are reaching out to the white House for comment. Our colleague Kevin Liptak is handling that right now. We should be able to get that from Kevin in just a moment. But what I will say is that the president has had this in his, in his sights to to renovate this area, to do a ballroom for years, not just months, years, including before he came into office. He said he offered the Obama administration, you know, that he said he would pay for it. The Obama administration, he said, never got back to him. President Trump has said many times that he believes this is necessary, that people who come to the white House, for certain events, they have to go to a tent that's kind of separate from the main, main body of the white House. And in bad weather, a lot of people who are here for balls and things like that, they just get kind of, disheveled, having to walk through the rain and get into a tent. That's been his perspective. He's been eyeing this for a long time. His idea is to make this very much like the Donald Trump Ballroom at Mar-A-Lago. It's going to look a lot like that. And there are plenty of other ballrooms that I've been to, many of them. Right near the white House, huge ballrooms that they could go to, not just a. I've been to the tent on the backyard of the white House on this, on this on the North Lawn of the white House, and the South Lawn of the white House as well. And that east wing was beautiful. And too bad it's been destroyed. Ari. Brian, thank you very, very much. Kevin Liptak is over at the white House right now. This has been a huge priority for the president. And as Brian just said, you're working to get some reaction. Are you learning anything? Yeah. The white House hasn't responded to this lawsuit specifically, but I'll tell you that white House officials have sort of downplayed criticism from this particular group, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which you'll remember back in October as this project was getting underway, actually wrote a letter to the white House asking them to pause work to, go through some of these various boards for review. And the white House said at the time that this, trust, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, was comprised of, quote, loser Democrats and liberal donors. And so you see them kind of shrugging off the criticism, we should say that this body is chartered by Congress, tasked with, preserving some of the nation's historic buildings. It actually does have a relationship with President Trump dating back to the 1990s. It worked with him on some projects at Mar-A-Lago. So he does have sort of an existing relationship with this, body, going back several decades. We should say that, the boards that this, group is now requesting and demanding that the court, require that the administration go through the National Capital Planning Commission is now stacked with President Trump's appointees. It's led by Will Scharf, who's the staff secretary at the white House. He has said previously that this project will eventually go before that body, but that it's purview and that its remit does not cover demolition. And that is why they say this project didn't go before that board, before they began tearing down the East wing, but that once sort of vertical construction begins, that it will go before that body. And so, whether this lawsuit sort of spurs that action and prompts them to go more quickly remains to be seen. But you're right. This is an absolute priority of the president. He still mentions that, on almost a weekly basis, you know, when, the crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was here, for example, the president said, that the dinner he held in his honor on the white House state floor would have been a much grander occasion if they had had, that ballroom constructed in his honor. We should also say that there has been some, discord among the planning team. You know, the president has assigned a new architect, the previous architect still on board, but he had reportedly raised some questions about the sheer scale of this project. You know, the president is envisioning a 90,000 square foot ballroom. The white House itself is only about 55,000ft\u00b2. And one of the concerns that the National Trust for Historic Preservation has raised is that they would essentially dwarf the original building once it's completed. And so all of these concerns are now due to be, heard in court, Wolf, the president keeps pointing out that, this ballroom will be paid for by private donations, not taxpayers. Is that a factor here? It could be. And I think, you know, the president and the white House have said that they will be transparent and they have released, some of the names of the donors who will contribute to this project. One of the questions is how potentially they'll be honored as part of it, whether their names will be, written on the wall or whether they'll have sort of plaques, in the final, ballroom to designate who who donated and, what sort of contribution they were able to make to this project. But it has raised a certainly questions about what kind of influence those donors, might have with the white House and whether or not these individuals are essentially using these donations to curry favor with the president, recognizing that this is a major priority of his. All right. Kevin Liptak at the white House for us, Kevin, thank you very, very much.",

Gavin Newsom, Santa Clara County and San Francisco are suing the Trump administration over a huge shift in homelessness policy.\nWelcome to CalMatters, the only nonprofit newsroom devoted solely to covering issues that affect all Californians. Sign up for WhatMatters to receive the latest news and commentary on the most important issues in the Golden State.\nCalifornia is fighting back after President Donald Trump\u2019s administration instigated homeless housing cuts that local service providers said would be \u201cdevastating.\u201d\nTwo recently filed lawsuits accuse the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development of illegally going over Congress\u2019 head to make massive changes to the way federal homelessness funds are distributed.\n\u201cHUD\u2019s new grant rules would effectively defund permanent supportive housing and rapid rehousing programs across the nation, eliminating proven tools that help residents exit homelessness sustainably,\u201d Santa Clara County Counsel Tony LoPresti said in a statement. \u201cThis is another instance of the Trump administration prioritizing its political agenda above the needs of our most vulnerable community members.\u201d\nSanta Clara County and San Francisco sued the Trump administration this week, in conjunction with the National Alliance to End Homelessness and the National Low Income Housing Coalition. A separate lawsuit was filed last week by Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s administration and a group of other states. It marked the 47th time California sued the Trump administration in 44 weeks.\nNow, homeless service providers are waiting anxiously to see how the litigation plays out and wondering if the impending legal battle will further delay the money they desperately need.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just the matter of how long it\u2019s going to take that concerns me,\u201d said Robert Ratner, director of Santa Cruz County\u2019s Housing for Health, which coordinates the county\u2019s homelessness response. \u201cBecause while we\u2019re waiting for these issues to get resolved, we have programs that are going to run out of money to support people.\u201d\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development did not respond to a request for comment.\nIn a statement last month, HUD Secretary Scott Turner said the changes are aimed at \u201cstopping the Biden-era slush fund that fueled the homelessness crisis, shut out faith-based providers simply because of their values, and incentivized never-ending government dependency.\u201d\nAt issue are changes the Trump administration made to its funding policy last month. Jurisdictions applying for a piece of about $4 billion in federal homelessness funds now can\u2019t spend more than 30% of that money on permanent housing \u2014 a significant decrease. Los Angeles County, for example, currently spends more than 80% on permanent housing. Instead, the federal government wants localities to prioritize emergency shelter and temporary housing programs that require participants to be sober or participate in treatment.\nWhile shelters offer a temporary respite from the streets, permanent housing can end someone\u2019s homelessness. For years, the federal government has prioritized funding permanent housing using the \u201chousing first\u201d method \u2014 a strategy that moves people into housing as quickly as possible, without requiring them to first get sober or agree to addiction treatment. Veering away from both of those principles marks a major policy shift.\nLast year, California communities won more than $683 million in federal homelessness funds through what is called the Continuum of Care program. About 90% of that went to permanent housing projects, which currently house tens of thousands of Californians, according to Newsom. The new rule threatens to put those people back out onto the street, he said in a news release.\n\u201cWhile we\u2019re waiting for these issues to get resolved, we have programs that are going to run out of money to support people.\u201d\nThe new policy also prohibits the use of federal funds for diversity and inclusion efforts, support of transgender clients, and use of \u201charm reduction\u201d strategies that seek to reduce overdose deaths by helping people in active addiction use drugs more safely. And it gives preference for projects in cities, counties and states that ban homeless encampments.\nBoth lawsuits allege that the Trump administration\u2019s funding changes violate the Administrative Procedure Act and the Constitution by defying the rules Congress set out for distributing the funds. Congress authorized a two-year grant cycle in 2024, meaning local jurisdictions wouldn\u2019t have to reapply for funds in 2025. The Trump administration flouted that decision when it suddenly forced jurisdictions to reapply, the lawsuits allege.\nThe lawsuits also claim the administration didn\u2019t go through proper protocol before enacting the changes to its funding strategy, which would have included giving cities and counties more time to comply with the new rules, and allowing stakeholders to comment on the changes.\nIn Santa Cruz County, Ratner is of two minds about the lawsuits. On one hand, he believes the abrupt way the Trump administration rolled out the funding changes was \u201cvery inappropriate.\u201d But he worries a lengthy court battle could tie up funds his county needs to pay people\u2019s rents.\nThe National Alliance to End Homelessness sued the Trump administration over similar allegations tied to a smaller, $75 million pot of homelessness funding in September. A judge sided with the Alliance, and temporarily barred the federal government from distributing those funds. But now that money is frozen, unable to help unhoused residents as the case moves forward.\nRatner worries that could happen again in this case. Santa Cruz County is set to start hitting serious financial problems as soon as February, Ratner said. That\u2019s when a $1.2 million supportive housing grant, which currently houses about 50 people in different apartments around \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Sign up for WhatMatters to receive the latest news and commentary on the most important issues in the Golden State.\nCalifornia is fighting back after President Donald Trump\u2019s administration instigated homeless housing cuts that local service providers said would be \u201cdevastating.\u201d\nTwo recently filed lawsuits accuse the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development of illegally going over Congress\u2019 head to make massive changes to the way federal homelessness funds are distributed.\n\u201cHUD\u2019s new grant rules would effectively defund permanent supportive housing and rapid rehousing programs across the nation, eliminating proven tools that help residents exit homelessness sustainably,\u201d Santa Clara County Counsel Tony LoPresti said in a statement. \u201cThis is another instance of the Trump administration prioritizing its political agenda above the needs of our most vulnerable community members.\u201d\nSanta Clara County and San Francisco sued the Trump administration this week, in conjunction with the National Alliance to End Homelessness and the National Low Income Housing Coalition. A separate lawsuit was filed last week by Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s administration and a group of other states. It marked the 47th time California sued the Trump administration in 44 weeks.\nNow, homeless service providers are waiting anxiously to see how the litigation plays out and wondering if the impending legal battle will further delay the money they desperately need.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just the matter of how long it\u2019s going to take that concerns me,\u201d said Robert Ratner, director of Santa Cruz County\u2019s Housing for Health, which coordinates the county\u2019s homelessness response. \u201cBecause while we\u2019re waiting for these issues to get resolved, we have programs that are going to run out of money to support people.\u201d\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development did not respond to a request for comment.\nIn a statement last month, HUD Secretary Scott Turner said the changes are aimed at \u201cstopping the Biden-era slush fund that fueled the homelessness crisis, shut out faith-based providers simply because of their values, and incentivized never-ending government dependency.\u201d\nAt issue are changes the Trump administration made to its funding policy last month. Jurisdictions applying for a piece of about $4 billion in federal homelessness funds now can\u2019t spend more than 30% of that money on permanent housing \u2014 a significant decrease. Los Angeles County, for example, currently spends more than 80% on permanent housing. Instead, the federal government wants localities to prioritize emergency shelter and temporary housing programs that require participants to be sober or participate in treatment.\nWhile shelters offer a temporary respite from the streets, permanent housing can end someone\u2019s homelessness. For years, the federal government has prioritized funding permanent housing using the \u201chousing first\u201d method \u2014 a strategy that moves people into housing as quickly as possible, without requiring them to first get sober or agree to addiction treatment. Veering away from both of those principles marks a major policy shift.\nLast year, California communities won more than $683 million in federal homelessness funds through what is called the Continuum of Care program. About 90% of that went to permanent housing projects, which currently house tens of thousands of Californians, according to Newsom. The new rule threatens to put those people back out onto the street, he said in a news release.\n\u201cWhile we\u2019re waiting for these issues to get resolved, we have programs that are going to run out of money to support people.\u201d\nThe new policy also prohibits the use of federal funds for diversity and inclusion efforts, support of transgender clients, and use of \u201charm reduction\u201d strategies that seek to reduce overdose deaths by helping people in active addiction use drugs more safely. And it gives preference for projects in cities, counties and states that ban homeless encampments.\nBoth lawsuits allege that the Trump administration\u2019s funding changes violate the Administrative Procedure Act and the Constitution by defying the rules Congress set out for distributing the funds. Congress authorized a two-year grant cycle in 2024, meaning local jurisdictions wouldn\u2019t have to reapply for funds in 2025. The Trump administration flouted that decision when it suddenly forced jurisdictions to reapply, the lawsuits allege.\nThe lawsuits also claim the administration didn\u2019t go through proper protocol before enacting the changes to its funding strategy, which would have included giving cities and counties more time to comply with the new rules, and allowing stakeholders to comment on the changes.\nIn Santa Cruz County, Ratner is of two minds about the lawsuits. On one hand, he believes the abrupt way the Trump administration rolled out the funding changes was \u201cvery inappropriate.\u201d But he worries a lengthy court battle could tie up funds his county needs to pay people\u2019s rents.\nThe National Alliance to End Homelessness sued the Trump administration over similar allegations tied to a smaller, $75 million pot of homelessness funding in September. A judge sided with the Alliance, and temporarily barred the federal government from distributing those funds. But now that money is frozen, unable to help unhoused residents as the case moves forward.\nRatner worries that could happen again in this case. Santa Cruz County is set to start hitting serious financial problems as soon as February, Ratner said. That\u2019s when a $1.2 million supportive housing grant, which currently houses about 50 people in different apartments around \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

But Friday\u2019s lawsuit from the prominent preservation group is the largest stride yet in effectively halting the renovations.\nThe White House declined to comment on whether it would pause construction in response to the pending litigation but continued to defend Trump\u2019s project as legal.\n\u201cPresident Trump has full legal authority to modernize, renovate, and beautify the White House \u2013 just like all of his predecessors did,\u201d White House spokesperson Davis Ingle said in a statement.\nThe 90,000 square foot ballroom \u2014 which the administration began razing for in September \u2014 sparked a wave of outcry from preservationist groups, activists and Washington locals who deplored the changes as destruction to the historic building.\nThe White House is expected to submit plans to a federal planning commission this month, and the administration has said it has recruited additional architects to oversee the renovation.\nYour guide to Donald Trump\u2019s unprecedented overhaul of the federal government.\nBy signing up, you acknowledge and agree to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.
