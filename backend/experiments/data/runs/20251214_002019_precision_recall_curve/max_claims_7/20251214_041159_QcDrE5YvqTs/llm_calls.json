    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nIf, for the same work, women make only 77 cents for every dollar a man makes, why don\u2019t businesses hire only women? Wages are the biggest expense for most businesses. So, hiring only women would reduce costs by nearly a quarter \u2013 and that would go right to the bottom line. Don\u2019t businesses want to be profitable? Or, are they just really bad at math? Well, actually, it\u2019s the feminists, celebrities and politicians spreading this wage gap myth who have the math problem. Here\u2019s why: The 77-cents-on-the-dollar statistic is calculated by dividing the median earnings of all women working full-time by the median earnings of all men working full-time. In other words, if the average income of all men is, say, 40,000 dollars a year, and the average annual income of all women is, say, 30,800 dollars, that would mean that women earn 77 cents for every dollar a man earns. 30,800 divided by 40,000 equals .77. But these calculations don\u2019t reveal a gender wage injustice because it doesn\u2019t take into account occupation, position, education or hours worked per week. Even a study by the American Association of University Women, a feminist organization, shows that the actual wage gap shrinks to only 6.6 cents when you factor in different choices men and women make. And the key word here is \u201cchoice.\u201d The small wage gap that does exist has nothing to do with paying women less, let alone with sexism; it has to do with differences in individual career choices that men and women make. In 2009, the U.S. Department of Labor released a paper that examined more than 50 peer-reviewed studies and concluded that the oft-cited 23 percent wage gap \u201cmay be almost entirely the result of individual choices being made by both male and female workers.\u201d Well, let\u2019s look at some of those choices. Georgetown University compiled a list of the five best-paying college majors, and the percentage of men or women majoring in those fields: Number 1 best-paying major: Petroleum Engineering: 87% male Number 2: Pharmaceutical Sciences: 48% male 3: Mathematics and Computer Science: 67% male 4: Aerospace Engineering: 88% male 5: Chemical Engineering: 72% male Notice that women out-represent men in only one of the five top-paying majors \u2013 by only a few percentage points. Now consider the same study\u2019s list of the five worst paying college majors: Number 1: Counseling and Psychology: 74% female Number 2: Early Childhood Education: 97% female 3: Theology and Religious Vocations: 66% male 4: Human Services and Community Organization: 81% female 5: Social Work: 88% female Here, it\u2019s the women who lead in all but one category. Even within the same profession, men and women make different career choices that impact how much money they make. Take nursing, where male nurses on the whole earn 18% more than female nurses. The reason? Male nurses gravitate to the best-paying nursing specialties, they work longer hours, and disproportionately find jobs in cities with the highest compensation. Now, here\u2019s how one expert on nursing compensation, Professor Linda Aiken of the University of Pennsylvania, sums up the data: \u201cCareer choices and educational differences explain most, if not all, the gender gap in nursing.\u201d The Department of Labor paper concluded that once these differences are accounted for across all professions, the unexplained wage gap is somewhere between 4.8 and 7 percent \u2013 almost identical to the 6.6 percentage gap found by the AAUW. But why is there any gap at all? No one knows for sure, as both the AAUW and the Labor Department concede. There are so many variables that drive wages that no single study can cover them all. Few wage gap studies control for variables such as dangerous work environment; men are vastly overrepresented, for example, on oil rigs. And here\u2019s another variable: men are more willing and able to work long hours without advance notice. According to Harvard economist Claudia Goldin, even if two lawyers have the same education, same specialty, and work the same number of hours \u2014 firms pay more to someone who is willing to always be \u201con call\u201d and ready to be in the office when the firm needs them, as opposed to wanting a more regular schedule. This isn\u2019t sexism, it\u2019s just common sense. With more realistic categories and definitions, whatever wage gap remains would certainly narrow to point of vanishing. So it seems that business leaders aren\u2019t bad at math simply because they don\u2019t only hire women. Those who claim that for the same work women earn 77 cents on the dollar compared to men, on the other hand, are not merely bad at math --but at telling the truth.

    "input_prompt": "Claim:\nWomen make only 77 cents for every dollar a man makes.\n\nArticle Title:\nExplaining the Gender Wage Gap - Center for American Progress\n\nGoogle Search Snippet:\nThe most commonly cited statistic for the gender wage gap asserts that women earn only 77 cents for every dollar earned by men.\n\nFull Page Content:\nConnecting the gender pay gap to health\nThe gender pay gap is expected to persist for decades, particularly for women of color and in rural areas. What can we do to reverse this trend? How can we work together to improve the health and well-being of women and their children, entire communities and the overall economy? When women have opportunities, such as a fair chance for education, employment, and earnings, they are more likely to live longer and healthier lives. Their children are also more likely to fare better.\nFor the nation\u2019s women who work outside the home, decades of economic insecurity and pay inequity were made worse by the pandemic. On average, women in the U.S. earn little more than 80 cents for every dollar white men make. The gap exists in nearly every county across the country but is at its widest in rural areas where women earn 77 cents, on average, for every dollar men make. Women also earn less than men for similar work in Southern and Western Plains states.\nIf trends of the last 35 years continue, it would take decades longer for women living in rural areas to receive equal pay for comparable work. For all regions of the country, by the earliest estimates, it would take white women until 2069 to earn what white men make, Black and Indigenous women until 2369 and Hispanic women until 2451, according to the American Association of University Women.\n\u201cThe biggest myth that the general population has about the gender wage gap is that it\u2019s getting a lot better,\u201d said Dr. Jessamyn Schaller, an economics professor at Claremont McKenna College. \u201cThere is definitely still a substantial gender wage gap.\u201d\nThe earnings lost as a result of the pay gap have meant women have had fewer opportunities to make ends meet, let alone save for emergencies or retirement.\nRacial and gender discrimination have contributed to a system that has long undervalued and underpaid women. Biases exist at all stages of employment \u2014 from hiring and performance reviews to layoffs. The pandemic exposed the barriers that have prevented women and caregivers from participating in the workforce. A lack of supports \u2014 such as paid sick leave and family leave \u2014 and high child care costs placed additional burdens on women. This was especially true for those with low incomes and women of color \u2013 the two groups least likely to receive employer-provided benefits.\nThe gaps remain despite women\u2019s educational gains; women have made up the majority of the college-educated population for more than 40 years. In addition, women have been segregated into lower-paying sectors such as service, education and health care. Yet even in these industries, men earn more than women for equal work.
