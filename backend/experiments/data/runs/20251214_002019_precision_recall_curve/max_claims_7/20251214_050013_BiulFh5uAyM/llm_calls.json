    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nWhat you\u2019re about to see\u2026 is a historic moment. [TRUMP]: \u201c...we're very much working very closely with China and president Xi.\u201d [HOST]: Not that. [TRUMP]:\u201d...if you look at Idlib Province in Syria.\u201d [HOST]: Nope [TRUMP]:\u201cSo, Prime Minister Abe came here\u2026\u201d [HOST]: Not that either... But this... [TRUMP]: \u201cI'm going to be signing a national emergency. And it's been signed many times before. It's been signed by other presidents. There's rarely been a problem. They sign it; nobody cares. ..\u201d [HOST]: President Trump is right, many other presidents have used this power before. But his declaration isn\u2019t normal. At all. Why? Because by using it to fund his proposed border wall, he has made it the first time a president has used this power to pay for policy that had already been rejected by Congress. [GOITEIN]: \u201cThis this is an unprecedented abuse of power in terms of the president basically saying that Congress cannot limit him.\u201d [HOST]: That\u2019s Elizabeth Goitein from the Brennan Center for Justices. She\u2019s extensively studied presidential declarations of National Emergencies. And she\u2019ll help us better understand what\u2019s different about Trump\u2019s declaration. Let's start here, in December 2018: [TRUMP]: \u201cI am proud to shutdown the government for border security, Chuck. \u2026 I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I\u2019m not going to blame you for it.\u201d [HOST]: Trump said he would refuse to sign a budget into law unless it included $5.7 billion dollars for his proposed border wall on the U.S. / Mexico border. Democrats, who took control of the House of Representatives in January, refused to give in to the president\u2019s demand. The result\u2026 a political stalemate and the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. Eventually, on February 14th, a budget was passed\u2026 but it did not include funding for the border wall. That\u2019s when Trump decided to take executive action to fund his border wall by declaring a \u201cnational emergency.\u201d [GOITEIN]: This president is pushing a very dangerous vision of constitutional government where the president gets to do what he wants. And that's not what the Constitution provides for. This is dangerous. It's undemocratic. [HOST]: The declaration allows the president to unilaterally divert billions of dollars from military construction projects to fund this border wall. But now, Trump\u2019s declaration is being challenged in the courts and Congress. In a historic vote on February 26th, the House of Representatives voted to block a presidential national emergency for the first time ever. The legislation now moves to the Senate. [GOITEIN]: I think it's has a good chance of passing the Senate. At that point of course the president would veto it and then the chances are overriding that veto are slim to be sure. [HOST]: That\u2019s because Congress would need a supermajority vote, two-thirds of both chambers, to override a presidential veto. And since some say it\u2019s unlikely that it will be blocked by Congress, it will be left up to the courts to determine whether it\u2019s legal or not. Right now, 16 states are suing the president for what they say is an \u201cunconstitutional\u201d use of executive power. The lawsuit claims the president has used a \u201cmanufactured crisis\u201d to call for an emergency. [GOITEIN]: \u201cIn this case it's very clear from the president's words and his actions that he is declaring this emergency for the purpose of getting around Congress\u2026 That's an abuse of power. [HOST]: What Goitein is saying there\u2026 isn\u2019t really controversial. In fact, the president even made this point himself in the very same speech where he first announced his declaration. [TRUMP]: \u201cI could do the wall over a longer period of time, I didn't need to do this, but I'd rather do it much faster.\u201d [HOST]: But let\u2019s take a step back. Despite this announcement being the first of its kind, presidential declarations of national emergencies definitely aren\u2019t anything new, or out of the ordinary. For example, in addition to this most recent one, President Trump has declared three others during his time in office. President Obama? He issued 12. Bush? 13. And Clinton? 17. In addition to the recent one, there are 31 other active national emergencies, which need to be renewed every year. The oldest one still in effect is from president Jimmy Carter in 1979 -- which were sanctions in response to the Iran hostage crisis. But when did this type of power first arise? First, it\u2019s important to know that the U.S. Constitution doesn\u2019t explicitly give a president the right to declare a national emergency. But presidents have taken this type of unilateral action for some time now -- claiming it\u2019s part of the \u201cexecutive powers\u201d granted to them in the constitution. President Woodrow Wilson was the first president to declare a national emergency during World War I. Since then, numerous presidents have used this type of executive power -- sometimes in really awful ways. Take Franklin Roosevelt for example\u2026 He used it to order the internment of over 100,000 Japanese-Americans during World War II . But this type of executive power has been successfully blocked too. In the 1950s, the Supreme Court blocked President Harry Truman\u2019s attempt to nationalize the steel industry during the the Korean War. With this type of presidential overreach fresh in the minds of Congress, it took action to scale back executive power in the 1970s. [GOITEIN]: \u201cThere had been several just massive scandals involving executive branch overreach. For example Watergate, the bombing of Cambodia during Vietnam, the CIA's domestic spying programs and all of these things came to light at around the same time. And so Congress just decided to take a very hard look at executive power in general.\u201d [HOST]: It passed the National Emergencies Act of 1976. The legislation formalized a president\u2019s ability to declare national emergencies, but also aimed to give legislators the ability to check the president\u2019s power. But Goitein says since it passed, the law has failed to limit presidential powers the way it intended to. And she argues that if Trump\u2019s recent declaration is allowed to stay in effect, it would set a really dangerous precedent. [GOITEIN]: It is not by any means the scariest of the emergency powers that become available to a president when he declares a national emergency. There are powers that allow the president simply by declaring a national emergency to shut down or take over radio stations. Powers that allow him to freeze Americans bank accounts and criminalize doing business with Americans that are designated by the government. [HOST]: Those examples of potential areas of abuse by a president are why Goiten says Congress needs to act now -- not only to place limits on President Trump\u2019s power, but for those who occupy the office after him as well.",

The Court\u2019s decision in Marbury v. Madison (1803) implied, and later cases confirmed, that federal courts also possess authority to review the actions of the executive branch. As another essay in this series explains, that review frequently concerns the actions of administrative agencies, particularly since the early twentieth-century inception of the modern administrative state. On various occasions throughout history, and more frequently in modern times, the judiciary has also been called upon to assess the validity of formal directions the president has issued to executive branch agencies and officials, most commonly in the form of executive orders. Federal court review of executive orders helps to define the scope of presidential powers and serves as a significant aspect of the checks and balances woven into the American constitutional system.\nArticle I of the U.S. Constitution vests the legislative power of the United States in Congress alone. The line between legislative and executive power is not always clearly defined, however. In the course of directing the activities of the executive branch, presidents since George Washington have issued executive orders on a wide variety of subjects, including public lands, military matters, economic crises, and civil rights. Franklin D. Roosevelt issued over 3,700 executive orders, far more than any other president, while Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, and Calvin Coolidge each issued more than a thousand. Most executive orders have dealt with routine administrative matters, while others, such as Abraham Lincoln\u2019s Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 and Harry Truman\u2019s desegregation of the armed forces in 1948, have made substantial policy changes. Modern presidents have not necessarily issued more executive orders than their earlier counterparts, but many of their orders have been broader in scope and significance.\nA president\u2019s authority to issue an executive order typically comes, either explicitly or implicitly, from a congressional statute, but on occasion presidents have justified orders on the basis of their constitutional power to execute the nation\u2019s laws. Whether the Constitution empowers the president only to execute policies devised by Congress or additionally vests the president with substantive policymaking powers has long been a matter of dispute. As a result, orders based on inherent presidential powers not authorized by Congress are more likely to raise separation-of-powers concerns. In these cases, courts must determine whether the president has exercised legislative power belonging only to Congress.\nCourts may strike down executive orders not only on the grounds that the president lacked authority to issue them but also in cases where the order is found to be unconstitutional in substance. In some cases, it is not an executive order itself that is challenged in court, but instead a regulation promulgated pursuant to an order or the manner in which executive branch officials have interpreted an order. While many executive orders have been challenged on specific statutory and constitutional grounds, others have been subjected to \u201creasonableness review.\u201d In the early twentieth century, the Supreme Court began to read the Due Process Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to include a guarantee of \u201csubstantive due process.\u201d This legal concept permitted courts to review both statutes and executive actions limiting the rights to life, liberty, or property to ensure that they were reasonable. Critics of reasonableness review, many of them progressive reformers, argued that the practice was antidemocratic because it substituted the judgment of courts for that of elected officials. Moreover, many believed that the courts applied reasonableness review too aggressively, in particular where economic regulation was concerned.\nIn the late 1930s, as the Supreme Court began to uphold New Deal economic regulations similar to those it had previously struck down, it also embraced a more deferential approach to executive action by adopting \u201crational basis\u201d review. Under this standard, an executive order would survive a due process challenge if it was rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose. Unlike the reasonableness standard, rational basis review did not require the submission of evidence to establish valid grounds for an order. Instead, any rational basis for the order the court could imagine was sufficient. Since the 1940s, rational basis review has continued to govern most due process challenges to executive orders, but federal courts have in some instances engaged in the more stringent reasonableness review. The Supreme Court has not established a uniform standard governing the level of scrutiny courts must give to executive orders.\nExecutive orders have most frequently come before the federal courts in the context of attempts to invalidate them or halt their enforcement. Some cases, however, have been brought to enforce rights allegedly created by an executive order. One especially common example of such suits, typically occurring in the 1960s and later, was a suit in which one private party sued another for damages arising from the defendant\u2019s violation of an order forbidding employment discrimination. Courts have often refused to hear such cases, particularly when the order was issued under the president\u2019s inherent constitutional powers. While the federal courts have jurisdiction over civil suits arising under the Constitution, federal law, and treaties (otherwise known as \u201cfederal question\u201d jurisdiction), courts have held that executive orders not authorized by Congress are not \u201cfederal law\u201d for these purposes.

The Court\u2019s decision in Marbury v. Madison (1803) implied, and later cases confirmed, that federal courts also possess authority to review the actions of the executive branch. As another essay in this series explains, that review frequently concerns the actions of administrative agencies, particularly since the early twentieth-century inception of the modern administrative state. On various occasions throughout history, and more frequently in modern times, the judiciary has also been called upon to assess the validity of formal directions the president has issued to executive branch agencies and officials, most commonly in the form of executive orders. Federal court review of executive orders helps to define the scope of presidential powers and serves as a significant aspect of the checks and balances woven into the American constitutional system.\nArticle I of the U.S. Constitution vests the legislative power of the United States in Congress alone. The line between legislative and executive power is not always clearly defined, however. In the course of directing the activities of the executive branch, presidents since George Washington have issued executive orders on a wide variety of subjects, including public lands, military matters, economic crises, and civil rights. Franklin D. Roosevelt issued over 3,700 executive orders, far more than any other president, while Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, and Calvin Coolidge each issued more than a thousand. Most executive orders have dealt with routine administrative matters, while others, such as Abraham Lincoln\u2019s Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 and Harry Truman\u2019s desegregation of the armed forces in 1948, have made substantial policy changes. Modern presidents have not necessarily issued more executive orders than their earlier counterparts, but many of their orders have been broader in scope and significance.\nA president\u2019s authority to issue an executive order typically comes, either explicitly or implicitly, from a congressional statute, but on occasion presidents have justified orders on the basis of their constitutional power to execute the nation\u2019s laws. Whether the Constitution empowers the president only to execute policies devised by Congress or additionally vests the president with substantive policymaking powers has long been a matter of dispute. As a result, orders based on inherent presidential powers not authorized by Congress are more likely to raise separation-of-powers concerns. In these cases, courts must determine whether the president has exercised legislative power belonging only to Congress.\nCourts may strike down executive orders not only on the grounds that the president lacked authority to issue them but also in cases where the order is found to be unconstitutional in substance. In some cases, it is not an executive order itself that is challenged in court, but instead a regulation promulgated pursuant to an order or the manner in which executive branch officials have interpreted an order. While many executive orders have been challenged on specific statutory and constitutional grounds, others have been subjected to \u201creasonableness review.\u201d In the early twentieth century, the Supreme Court began to read the Due Process Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to include a guarantee of \u201csubstantive due process.\u201d This legal concept permitted courts to review both statutes and executive actions limiting the rights to life, liberty, or property to ensure that they were reasonable. Critics of reasonableness review, many of them progressive reformers, argued that the practice was antidemocratic because it substituted the judgment of courts for that of elected officials. Moreover, many believed that the courts applied reasonableness review too aggressively, in particular where economic regulation was concerned.\nIn the late 1930s, as the Supreme Court began to uphold New Deal economic regulations similar to those it had previously struck down, it also embraced a more deferential approach to executive action by adopting \u201crational basis\u201d review. Under this standard, an executive order would survive a due process challenge if it was rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose. Unlike the reasonableness standard, rational basis review did not require the submission of evidence to establish valid grounds for an order. Instead, any rational basis for the order the court could imagine was sufficient. Since the 1940s, rational basis review has continued to govern most due process challenges to executive orders, but federal courts have in some instances engaged in the more stringent reasonableness review. The Supreme Court has not established a uniform standard governing the level of scrutiny courts must give to executive orders.\nExecutive orders have most frequently come before the federal courts in the context of attempts to invalidate them or halt their enforcement. Some cases, however, have been brought to enforce rights allegedly created by an executive order. One especially common example of such suits, typically occurring in the 1960s and later, was a suit in which one private party sued another for damages arising from the defendant\u2019s violation of an order forbidding employment discrimination.

Trump\u2019s designation for opioids is a separate emergency focused on the Health and Human Services Department.\nThat determination was not criticized by public health officials contacted by CNN who worked in previous administrations.\nPublic health emergencies are often declared in the aftermath of a natural disaster like a hurricane or after a disease outbreak. A public health emergency has already been declared 15 times in 2017, including multiple times, usually for individual states, after Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria and Nate. HHS also used the public health emergency designation in 2017 after the California wildfires and renewed designations having to do with Zika virus.\nThe President\u2019s opioid panel recommended both options \u2013 public health emergency and national emergency \u2013 as possible paths forward for Trump. Trump had signaled in August that he intended to declare a national emergency.\n\u201cThe opioid crisis is an emergency, and I am saying, officially, right now, it is an emergency. It\u2019s a national emergency,\u201d Trump said in August. \u201cWe\u2019re going to spend a lot of time, a lot of effort and a lot of money on the opioid crisis. It is a serious problem the likes of which we have never had.\u201d\nA senior White House official told CNN on Thursday that the declaration would be made under the Public Health Services Act, saying a full-blown national emergency would have opened the door to unnecessary funding that is intended for the immediate aftermath of disasters.\nThe rapid increase in the number of drug-related deaths over the last two decades prompted Trump\u2019s comments in August and much discussion during the 2016 campaign.\nMore than two dozen national emergencies are already in effect from past presidents, many of them already renewed by Trump.\nThis is according to a CNN analysis of data from the Congressional Research Service, the Federal Register and the White House.\nDeclaring a national state of emergency under the National Emergencies Act of 1974 outlines how a president can activate special statutory power during a crisis.\nGeorge W. Bush declared 13 emergencies and Barack Obama declared 12 \u2013 nearly all of which are still active today. Bill Clinton declared 17 national emergencies, six of which are still active. Ronald Reagan declared six and George H.W. Bush declared four \u2013 but all of those have been revoked by now.\nThe first declaration under the National Emergencies Act of 1974 came during the Iran hostage crisis \u2013 a national emergency that is still active today. Jimmy Carter blocked Iranian government property from entering the country. It\u2019s been renewed each year by all presidents since then.\nPresidents must renew national emergencies every year because the statute lets emergencies automatically expire after one year.\nA special White House panel led by New Jersey Republican Gov. Chris Christie recommended that Trump make an emergency declaration on opioids. A statement from the White House in August said Trump has \u201cinstructed his Administration to use all appropriate emergency and other authorities to respond to the crisis caused by the opioid epidemic.\u201d\nOther ongoing national emergencies focus on the 9/11 terror attacks, the war in Iraq and the blocking of some property and people from around the world in countries such as Yemen, Ukraine, South Sudan, Venezuela and Burundi.\nPast emergencies have focused on everything from swine flu to rough diamonds.\nHere\u2019s a list of the 28 active national emergencies:\n1. Blocking Iranian Government Property (Nov. 14, 1979)\n2. Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (Nov. 14, 1994)\n3. Prohibiting Transactions with Terrorists Who Threaten to Disrupt the Middle East Peace Process (Jan. 23, 1995)\n4. Prohibiting Certain Transactions with Respect to the Development of Iranian Petroleum Resources (Mar. 15, 1995)\n5. Blocking Assets and Prohibiting Transactions with Significant Narcotics Traffickers (Oct. 21, 1995)\n6. Regulations of the Anchorage and Movement of Vessels with Respect to Cuba (Mar. 1, 1996)\n7. Blocking Sudanese Government Property and Prohibiting Transactions with Sudan (Nov. 3, 1997)\n8. Blocking Property of Persons Who Threaten International Stabilization Efforts in the Western Balkans (Jun. 26, 2001)\n9. Continuation of Export Control Regulations (Aug. 17, 2001)\n10. Declaration of National Emergency by Reason of Certain Terrorist Attacks (Sept. 14, 2001)\n11. Blocking Property and Prohibiting Transactions with Persons who Commit, Threaten to Commit, or Support Terrorism (Sept. 23, 2001)\n12.

This executive order finally calls that what it is \u2014 an emergency,\u201d he said. \u201cI fear that this lawsuit, by contrast, tends to treat paperwork as sacred and energy security as optional.

Segal suggested the states may have difficulty convincing a judge that Trump\u2019s emergency declaration overstepped the bounds of his authority.\n\u201cThe National Emergencies Act and Defense Production Act seem to give the president broad leeway to declare emergencies in areas implicating national security and industrial mobilization,\u201d Segal said. \u201cThe interesting question is whether a court will find an emergency in current circumstances, but courts don\u2019t typically second-guess the executive branch on emergencies.\u201d\nSegal also questioned the states\u2019 contention that the emergency declaration, by calling for accelerated permitting timelines, will necessarily result in lower standards of review. \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember \u2014 expedited doesn\u2019t mean lawless,\u201d he said.\nMore fundamentally, Segal said that lengthy bureaucratic delays in energy permitting is indeed a problem that needs to be addressed.\n\u201cCandidly, if American energy can\u2019t get permits in under a decade, we have a permitting problem, not a production problem. This executive order finally calls that what it is \u2014 an emergency,\u201d he said. \u201cI fear that this lawsuit, by contrast, tends to treat paperwork as sacred and energy security as optional. That might be a little backward.\u201d\nMedia Mentions\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",
