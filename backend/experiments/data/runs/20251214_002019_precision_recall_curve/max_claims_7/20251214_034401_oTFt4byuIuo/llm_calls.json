    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nTrump's egg price warning comes true. Reality hits home. For months, President Donald Trump has falsely claimed that egg prices are tumbling. It wasn't true then, but it's true now. Egg prices fell 12.7% last month, the biggest monthly decline since 1984. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Tuesday, and they could continue to fall this month, too. The USDA reported last week that a dozen large white shell eggs now cost $330 on average, down a whopping 69 from a week before. It's a remarkable reversal after egg prices surged in each of the past 5 months and 17 of the past 19 months because of a deadly aven flu epidemic that necessitated the mass culling of egg laying hens. Maybe the worst of egg gate has passed. Tyler Shipper, associate professor in economics and data analysis at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota, told CNN. Nevertheless, egg prices remain significantly higher now than before the latest bird flu outbreak, and they cost 49.3% more last month than they did a year earlier. Eggs are still more expensive than when Trump took office, according to the BLS. Egg prices this past Easter, which typically rise in the run-up to the holiday, were the highest for any Easter on record, the USDA reported. Well, before last month's decline, Trump had been touting falling egg prices as a sign that his administration's plan to lower prices for consumers has been working. In February, the USDA announced an initiative to lower egg prices, including increased biocurity on egg laying farms, aid to farmers who have lost flocks and temporary lifting of restrictions on egg imports. Despite agriculture secretary Brooke Rollins far more conservative estimate that egg prices would normalize in the summer, Trump last month said, \"As you know, the cost of eggs has come down like 93 94% since we took office. Those percentage declines, Trump stated, are not close to accurate. But we now know that consumer egg prices were indeed falling sharply when Trump made those remarks. The consumer price index data wasn't out yet to confirm or deny Trump's claims. It appears as though Trump may have been talking about wholesale prices, which had been tumbling throughout March before normalizing in recent weeks. Nevertheless, wholesale prices fell by half, not close to the 90% plus figures Trump was citing. Wholesale prices are the costs distributors pay to farmers or middlemen. Consumer prices are what customers pay at grocery stores. Those costs typically make their way through the supply chain at a slower pace because grocery stores may decide to keep prices at a certain price even when wholesale prices change to try to recoup loss profits from prior weeks according to Kevin Bergquist, sector manager at Wells Fargo Agri Food Institute. from prior weeks. According to Kevin Bergquist, sector manager at Wells Fargo Agri Food Institute, the USDA says consumer prices finally fell as demand for eggs decreased and aven flu cases have fallen. Many groceries, including large chains like Costco, had limited customers purchases because of egg shortages. So, Trump's claim that consumer egg prices are down is finally true, even if the timing of his claim and the wild percentages he threw around were grossly inaccurate.

It wasn't true then, but it's true now. Egg prices fell 12.7% last month.\n\nFull Page Content:\nConsumer egg prices have climbed 25% since January, data shows.\nPresident Donald Trump this week disputed criticism over high egg prices in an exclusive interview with ABC News, faulting his predecessor for the price hike and claiming what he described as a recent decline in egg prices.\n\u201cYou remember the big thing with eggs? They hit me the first week, \u2018Eggs, eggs, eggs,\u2019 like it was my fault. I said, \u2018I didn't cause this problem. This problem was caused by [Joe] Biden,\u2019\u201d Trump told ABC News\u2019 Terry Moran.\n\u201cEgg prices are down,\u201d Trump later added.\nThe remarks echoed claims made repeatedly by Trump since he took office, but his assessment of egg prices is potentially misleading, some food economists told ABC News.\nRetail egg prices, or the prices paid by shoppers, have climbed over the early months of Trump\u2019s term, meaning household budgets have been slammed by worsening egg costs, the economists said.\nBy contrast, wholesale egg prices -- the amount grocers pay to suppliers -- have dropped significantly since Trump took office, though Trump appeared to overstate the amount of decline during the ABC News interview.\nIt remains unclear when and to what extent that decline in wholesale egg prices will translate into relief for consumers, economists added.\n\u201cEgg prices have been increasing at the retail level and that\u2019s really important when assessing the claim President Trump made yesterday,\u201d said David Ortega, a food economist at Michigan State University.\nParke Wilde, a food economist at Tufts University, added: \"I encourage people who are reading the news about food prices to focus on consumer prices, not wholesale prices, because that\u2019s what real consumers care about.\"\nEconomists also largely rejected the attribution of blame for egg prices to any president, whether former President Joe Biden or Trump, saying a president exerts minimal influence over day-to-day egg costs.\n\u201cThe president has little or no control over egg prices,\u201d Ortega said. \u201cAny changes, whether egg prices go up or down, have almost nothing to do with what the president or any other policymaker is doing.\u201d\nDespite Trump\u2019s claim that eggs prices are falling, the price paid by shoppers has increased significantly since he took office, food economists said.\nThe average retail price of a dozen eggs climbed from $4.95 in January to $6.22 in March, the most recent month for which data is available. That change in price amounted to a 25% spike, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows.\nIn recent years, bird flu -- also known as avian flu -- has decimated the egg supply while demand has persisted, lifting prices higher.\n\u201cEven as egg prices have exploded over the last year or two, we\u2019ve actually seen really strong demand for eggs,\u201d Trey Malone, a food economist at Purdue University, told ABC News.\n\u201cThe reality is it\u2019s really hard to substitute away from eggs. I can\u2019t make cookies without eggs if I want to make grandma\u2019s recipe.\u201d\nIn recent months, however, the rise in retail egg prices has coincided with a drop in wholesale prices. That decline largely owes to an easing of the avian flu outbreak, food economists told ABC News.\nWhen Trump refers to a drop in egg prices, he may be referring to the decline in wholesale prices. In a memo on Tuesday listing economic accomplishments, the White House highlighted the drop in wholesale egg prices while acknowledging that retail prices may still be elevated for some consumers.\n\"Most consumers have seen relief in prices on the shelf, but all consumers should see it within the next month or two,\" the White House said.\nSpeaking with ABC News on Tuesday, Trump said: \u201cEggs are down 87% since I got involved.\"\nTrump has provided different figures for the size of the drop in egg prices. On April 17, he said prices had fallen 92%, while on April 4 he said egg prices had dropped 87%.\nEach of those figures overstates the drop in wholesale egg prices, according to data from the USDA.\nOn Jan. 21, the day after Trump took office, the average wholesale price of a dozen eggs stood at $6.55; as of April 30, that price had dropped to $3.25, a Trading Economics analysis of USDA data shows. That change in price amounts to a roughly 50% decline.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not accurate to say egg prices have decreased by 87%,\u201d Ortega said. \u201cWholesale egg prices are down but they\u2019re not down by that much.\u201d\nThe decline in wholesale egg prices may result in a drop in the prices paid by consumers, but the timing and extent of the relief remain unclear, food economists said.\nThe lag owes in part to the nature of contracts between businesses and egg suppliers, which often lock in prices for weeks, experts said. Grocers may also be reluctant to slash egg prices, some experts added, since customers have largely kept up egg purchases at higher prices.\n\u201cFor as much people talk about increasing egg prices, they\u2019re still buying eggs,\u201d Malone said.\nABC News' Emily Chang contributed to this report.\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",
