    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nI\u2019m an atmospheric physicist. I\u2019ve published more than 200 scientific papers. For 30 years I taught at MIT, during which time the climate has changed remarkably little. But the cry of \u201cglobal warming\u201d has grown ever more shrill. In fact, it seems that the less the climate changes, the louder the voices of the climate alarmists get. So, let\u2019s clear the air and create a more accurate picture of where we really stand on the issue of global warming or, as it is now called -- climate change. There are basically three groups of people dealing with this issue. Groups one and two are scientists. Group three consists mostly, at its core, of politicians, environmentalists and media. Group one is associated with the scientific part of the United Nation\u2019s International Panel on Climate Change or IPCC (Working Group 1). These are scientists who mostly believe that recent climate change is primarily due to man\u2019s burning of fossil fuels -- oil, coal and natural gas. This releases C02, carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere and, they believe, this might eventually dangerously heat the planet. Group two is made up of scientists who don\u2019t see this as an especially serious problem. This is the group I belong to. We\u2019re usually referred to as skeptics. We note that there are many reasons why the climate changes -- the sun, clouds, oceans, the orbital variations of the earth, as well as a myriad of other inputs. None of these is fully understood, and there is no evidence that CO2 emissions are the dominant factor. But actually there is much agreement between both groups of scientists. The following are such points of agreement: 1) The climate is always changing. 2) CO2 is a greenhouse gas without which life on earth is not possible, but adding it to the atmosphere should lead to some warming. 3) Atmospheric levels of CO2 have been increasing since the end of the Little Ice Age in the 19th century. 4) Over this period (the past two centuries), the global mean temperature has increased slightly and erratically by about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit or one degree Celsius; but only since the 1960\u2019s have man\u2019s greenhouse emissions been sufficient to play a role. 5) Given the complexity of climate, no confident prediction about future global mean temperature or its impact can be made. The IPCC, acknowledged in its own 2007 report that \u201cThe long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible.\u201d Most importantly, the scenario that the burning of fossil fuels leads to catastrophe isn\u2019t part of what either group asserts. So why are so many people worried, indeed, panic stricken about this issue. Here\u2019s where Group Three comes in -- the politicians, environmentalists, and media. Global Warming Alarmism provides them, more than any other issue, with the things they most want: For politicians it\u2019s money and power. For environmentalists it\u2019s money for their organizations and confirmation of their near religious devotion to the idea that man is a destructive force acting upon nature. And for the media it\u2019s ideology, money, and headlines -- doomsday scenarios sell. Meanwhile, over the last decade, scientists outside of climate physics have jumped on the bandwagon, publishing papers blaming global warming for everything from acne to the Syrian civil war. And, crony capitalists have eagerly grabbed for the subsidies that governments have so lavishly provided. Unfortunately, group three is winning the argument because they have drowned out the serious debate that should be going on. But while politicians, environmentalists and media types can waste a lot of money and scare a lot of people, they won\u2019t be able to bury the truth. The climate will have the final word on that.

However, recent climate changes cannot be explained by natural causes alone.\nChanges in the earth\u2019s orbit and its axis of rotation have had a big impact on climate in the past. For example, the amount of summer sunshine on the Northern Hemisphere, which is affected by changes in the planet\u2019s orbit, appears to be the primary cause of past cycles of ice ages, in which the earth has experienced long periods of cold temperatures (ice ages), as well as shorter interglacial periods (periods between ice ages) of relatively warmer temperatures.1 At the coldest part of the last glacial period (or ice age), the average global temperature was about 11\u00b0F colder than it is today. At the peak of the last interglacial period, however, the average global temperature was at most 2\u00b0F warmer than it is today.2\nChanges in the sun\u2019s energy output can affect the intensity of the sunlight that reaches the earth\u2019s surface. While these changes can influence the earth\u2019s climate, solar variations have played little role in the climate changes observed in recent decades.3 Satellites have been measuring the amount of energy the earth receives from the sun since 1978. These measurements show no net increase in the sun\u2019s output, even as global surface temperatures have risen.4\nThe amount of sunlight that is absorbed or reflected by the planet depends on the earth\u2019s surface and atmosphere. Dark objects and surfaces, like the ocean, forests, and soil, tend to absorb more sunlight. Light-colored objects and surfaces, like snow and clouds, tend to reflect sunlight. About 70 percent of the sunlight that reaches the earth is absorbed.5 Natural changes in the earth\u2019s surface, like the melting of sea ice, have contributed to climate change in the past, often acting as feedbacks to other processes.\nVolcanoes have played a noticeable role in climate, and volcanic eruptions released large quantities of carbon dioxide in the distant past. Some explosive volcano eruptions can throw particles (e.g., SO2) into the upper atmosphere, where they can reflect enough sunlight back to space to cool the surface of the planet for several years.6 These particles are an example of cooling aerosols.\nVolcanic particles from a single eruption do not produce long-term climate change because they remain in the atmosphere for a much shorter time than greenhouse gases. In addition, human activities emit more than 100 times as much carbon dioxide as volcanoes each year.7\nOver the last several hundred thousand years, carbon dioxide levels varied in tandem with the glacial cycles. During warm interglacial periods, carbon dioxide levels were higher. During cool glacial periods, carbon dioxide levels were lower.8 The heating or cooling of the earth\u2019s surface and oceans can cause changes in the natural sources and sinks of these gases, and thus change greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.9 These changing concentrations have acted as a positive climate feedback, amplifying the temperature changes caused by long-term shifts in the earth\u2019s orbit.10\n1 National Academy of Sciences.

However, recent climate changes cannot be explained by natural causes alone.\nChanges in the earth\u2019s orbit and its axis of rotation have had a big impact on climate in the past. For example, the amount of summer sunshine on the Northern Hemisphere, which is affected by changes in the planet\u2019s orbit, appears to be the primary cause of past cycles of ice ages, in which the earth has experienced long periods of cold temperatures (ice ages), as well as shorter interglacial periods (periods between ice ages) of relatively warmer temperatures.1 At the coldest part of the last glacial period (or ice age), the average global temperature was about 11\u00b0F colder than it is today. At the peak of the last interglacial period, however, the average global temperature was at most 2\u00b0F warmer than it is today.2\nChanges in the sun\u2019s energy output can affect the intensity of the sunlight that reaches the earth\u2019s surface. While these changes can influence the earth\u2019s climate, solar variations have played little role in the climate changes observed in recent decades.3 Satellites have been measuring the amount of energy the earth receives from the sun since 1978. These measurements show no net increase in the sun\u2019s output, even as global surface temperatures have risen.4\nThe amount of sunlight that is absorbed or reflected by the planet depends on the earth\u2019s surface and atmosphere. Dark objects and surfaces, like the ocean, forests, and soil, tend to absorb more sunlight. Light-colored objects and surfaces, like snow and clouds, tend to reflect sunlight. About 70 percent of the sunlight that reaches the earth is absorbed.5 Natural changes in the earth\u2019s surface, like the melting of sea ice, have contributed to climate change in the past, often acting as feedbacks to other processes.\nVolcanoes have played a noticeable role in climate, and volcanic eruptions released large quantities of carbon dioxide in the distant past. Some explosive volcano eruptions can throw particles (e.g., SO2) into the upper atmosphere, where they can reflect enough sunlight back to space to cool the surface of the planet for several years.6 These particles are an example of cooling aerosols.\nVolcanic particles from a single eruption do not produce long-term climate change because they remain in the atmosphere for a much shorter time than greenhouse gases. In addition, human activities emit more than 100 times as much carbon dioxide as volcanoes each year.7\nOver the last several hundred thousand years, carbon dioxide levels varied in tandem with the glacial cycles. During warm interglacial periods, carbon dioxide levels were higher. During cool glacial periods, carbon dioxide levels were lower.8 The heating or cooling of the earth\u2019s surface and oceans can cause changes in the natural sources and sinks of these gases, and thus change greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.9 These changing concentrations have acted as a positive climate feedback, amplifying the temperature changes caused by long-term shifts in the earth\u2019s orbit.10\n1 National Academy of Sciences.

Across nearly 8,000 pages, the AR6 details the devastating consequences of rising greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions around the world \u2014 the destruction of homes, the loss of livelihoods and the fragmentation of communities, for example \u2014 as well as the increasingly dangerous and irreversible risks should we fail to change course.\nBut the IPCC also offers hope, highlighting pathways to avoid these intensifying risks. It identifies readily available, and in some cases, highly cost-effective actions that can be undertaken now to reduce GHG emissions, scale up carbon removal and build resilience. While the window to address the climate crisis is rapidly closing, the IPCC affirms that we can still secure a safe, livable future.\nHere are 10 key findings you need to know:\nAlready, with 1.1 degrees C (2 degrees F) of global temperature rise, changes to the climate system that are unparalleled over centuries to millennia are now occurring in every region of the world, from rising sea levels to more extreme weather events to rapidly disappearing sea ice.\nAdditional warming will increase the magnitude of these changes. Every 0.5 degree C (0.9 degrees F) of global temperature rise, for example, will cause clearly discernible increases in the frequency and severity of heat extremes, heavy rainfall events and regional droughts. Similarly, heatwaves that, on average, arose once every 10 years in a climate with little human influence will likely occur 4.1 times more frequently with 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) of warming, 5.6 times with 2 degrees C (3.6 degrees F) and 9.4 times with 4 degrees C (7.2 degrees F) \u2014 and the intensity of these heatwaves will also increase by 1.9 degrees C (3.4 degrees F), 2.6 degrees C (4.7 degrees F) and 5.1 degrees C (9.2 degrees F) respectively.\nRising global temperatures also heighten the probability of reaching dangerous tipping points in the climate system that, once crossed, can trigger self-amplifying feedbacks that further increase global warming, such as thawing permafrost or massive forest dieback. Setting such reinforcing feedbacks in motion can also lead to other substantial, abrupt and irreversible changes to the climate system. Should warming reach between 2 degrees C (3.6 degrees F) and 3 degrees C (5.4 degrees F), for example, the West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets could melt almost completely and irreversibly over many thousands of years, causing sea levels to rise by several meters.\nDescribed as an \u201can atlas of human suffering and a damning indictment of failed climate leadership\u201d by United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, one of AR6\u2019s most alarming conclusions is that adverse climate impacts are already more far-reaching and extreme than anticipated. About half of the global population currently contends with severe water scarcity for at least one month per year, while higher temperatures are enabling the spread of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, West Nile virus and Lyme disease. Climate change has also slowed improvements in agricultural productivity in middle and low latitudes, with crop productivity growth shrinking by a third in Africa since 1961. And since 2008, extreme floods and storms have forced over 20 million people from their homes every year.\nEvery fraction of a degree of warming will intensify these threats, and even limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degree C is not safe for all. At this level of warming, for example, 950 million people across the world\u2019s drylands will experience water stress, heat stress and desertification, while the share of the global population exposed to flooding will rise by 24%.\nSimilarly, overshooting 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F), even temporarily, will lead to much more severe, oftentimes irreversible impacts, from local species extinctions to the complete drowning of salt marshes to loss of human lives from increased heat stress. Limiting the magnitude and duration of overshooting 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F), then, will prove critical in ensuring a safe, livable future, as will holding warming to as close to 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) or below as possible. Even if this temperature limit is exceeded by the end of the century, the imperative to rapidly curb GHG emissions to avoid higher levels of warming and associated impacts remains unchanged.\nClimate policies in at least 170 countries now consider adaptation, but in many nations, these efforts have yet to progress from planning to implementation. Measures to build resilience are still largely small-scale, reactive and incremental, with most focusing on immediate impacts or near-term risks. This disparity between today\u2019s levels of adaptation and those required persists in large part due to limited finance. According to the IPCC, developing countries alone will need $127 billion per year by 2030 and $295 billion per year by 2050 to adapt to climate change. But funds for adaptation reached just $23 billion to $46 billion from 2017 to 2018, accounting for only 4% to 8% of tracked climate finance.\nThe good news is that the IPCC finds that, with sufficient support, proven and readily available adaptation solutions can build resilience to climate risks and, in many cases, simultaneously deliver broader sustainable development benefits.\nEcosystem-based adaptation, for example, can help communities adapt to impacts that are alread\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

At the peak of the last interglacial period, however, the average global temperature was at most 2\u00b0F warmer than it is today.2\nChanges in the sun\u2019s energy output can affect the intensity of the sunlight that reaches the earth\u2019s surface. While these changes can influence the earth\u2019s climate, solar variations have played little role in the climate changes observed in recent decades.3 Satellites have been measuring the amount of energy the earth receives from the sun since 1978. These measurements show no net increase in the sun\u2019s output, even as global surface temperatures have risen.4\nThe amount of sunlight that is absorbed or reflected by the planet depends on the earth\u2019s surface and atmosphere. Dark objects and surfaces, like the ocean, forests, and soil, tend to absorb more sunlight. Light-colored objects and surfaces, like snow and clouds, tend to reflect sunlight. About 70 percent of the sunlight that reaches the earth is absorbed.5 Natural changes in the earth\u2019s surface, like the melting of sea ice, have contributed to climate change in the past, often acting as feedbacks to other processes.\nVolcanoes have played a noticeable role in climate, and volcanic eruptions released large quantities of carbon dioxide in the distant past. Some explosive volcano eruptions can throw particles (e.g., SO2) into the upper atmosphere, where they can reflect enough sunlight back to space to cool the surface of the planet for several years.6 These particles are an example of cooling aerosols.\nVolcanic particles from a single eruption do not produce long-term climate change because they remain in the atmosphere for a much shorter time than greenhouse gases. In addition, human activities emit more than 100 times as much carbon dioxide as volcanoes each year.7\nOver the last several hundred thousand years, carbon dioxide levels varied in tandem with the glacial cycles. During warm interglacial periods, carbon dioxide levels were higher. During cool glacial periods, carbon dioxide levels were lower.8 The heating or cooling of the earth\u2019s surface and oceans can cause changes in the natural sources and sinks of these gases, and thus change greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.9 These changing concentrations have acted as a positive climate feedback, amplifying the temperature changes caused by long-term shifts in the earth\u2019s orbit.10\n1 National Academy of Sciences.

Drawing on the findings of 234 scientists on the physical science of climate change, 270 scientists on impacts, adaptation and vulnerability to climate change, and 278 scientists on climate change mitigation, this IPCC synthesis report provides the most comprehensive, best available scientific assessment of climate change.\nIt also makes for grim reading. Across nearly 8,000 pages, the AR6 details the devastating consequences of rising greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions around the world \u2014 the destruction of homes, the loss of livelihoods and the fragmentation of communities, for example \u2014 as well as the increasingly dangerous and irreversible risks should we fail to change course.\nBut the IPCC also offers hope, highlighting pathways to avoid these intensifying risks. It identifies readily available, and in some cases, highly cost-effective actions that can be undertaken now to reduce GHG emissions, scale up carbon removal and build resilience. While the window to address the climate crisis is rapidly closing, the IPCC affirms that we can still secure a safe, livable future.\nHere are 10 key findings you need to know:\nAlready, with 1.1 degrees C (2 degrees F) of global temperature rise, changes to the climate system that are unparalleled over centuries to millennia are now occurring in every region of the world, from rising sea levels to more extreme weather events to rapidly disappearing sea ice.\nAdditional warming will increase the magnitude of these changes. Every 0.5 degree C (0.9 degrees F) of global temperature rise, for example, will cause clearly discernible increases in the frequency and severity of heat extremes, heavy rainfall events and regional droughts. Similarly, heatwaves that, on average, arose once every 10 years in a climate with little human influence will likely occur 4.1 times more frequently with 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) of warming, 5.6 times with 2 degrees C (3.6 degrees F) and 9.4 times with 4 degrees C (7.2 degrees F) \u2014 and the intensity of these heatwaves will also increase by 1.9 degrees C (3.4 degrees F), 2.6 degrees C (4.7 degrees F) and 5.1 degrees C (9.2 degrees F) respectively.\nRising global temperatures also heighten the probability of reaching dangerous tipping points in the climate system that, once crossed, can trigger self-amplifying feedbacks that further increase global warming, such as thawing permafrost or massive forest dieback. Setting such reinforcing feedbacks in motion can also lead to other substantial, abrupt and irreversible changes to the climate system. Should warming reach between 2 degrees C (3.6 degrees F) and 3 degrees C (5.4 degrees F), for example, the West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets could melt almost completely and irreversibly over many thousands of years, causing sea levels to rise by several meters.\nDescribed as an \u201can atlas of human suffering and a damning indictment of failed climate leadership\u201d by United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, one of AR6\u2019s most alarming conclusions is that adverse climate impacts are already more far-reaching and extreme than anticipated. About half of the global population currently contends with severe water scarcity for at least one month per year, while higher temperatures are enabling the spread of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, West Nile virus and Lyme disease. Climate change has also slowed improvements in agricultural productivity in middle and low latitudes, with crop productivity growth shrinking by a third in Africa since 1961.

As a result, predictions for the 21st century are as shown below.\nScenario-specific projections are based on analysis of multiple runs by multiple climate models, using the various SRES Scenarios. \"Low scenario\" refers to B1, the most optimistic scenario family. \"High scenario\" refers to A1FI, the most pessimistic scenario family.\nThere are six families of SRES scenarios, and AR4 provides projected temperature and sea level rises (excluding future rapid dynamical changes in ice flow) for each scenario family.[20]\nIn the weeks before publication of the first report, controversy broke out about the report's projections of sea-level change, which in the new report was estimated at less than previous estimates.

Human activity is the principal cause.\nEarth's climate has changed throughout history. Just in the last 800,000 years, there have been eight cycles of ice ages and warmer periods, with the end of the last ice age about 11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era \u2014 and of human civilization. Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth\u2019s orbit that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives.\nThe current warming trend is different because it is clearly the result of human activities since the mid-1800s, and is proceeding at a rate not seen over many recent millennia.1 It is undeniable that human activities have produced the atmospheric gases that have trapped more of the Sun\u2019s energy in the Earth system. This extra energy has warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land, and widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred.\nEarth-orbiting satellites and new technologies have helped scientists see the big picture, collecting many different types of information about our planet and its climate all over the world. These data, collected over many years, reveal the signs and patterns of a changing climate.\nScientists demonstrated the heat-trapping nature of carbon dioxide and other gases in the mid-19th century.2 Many of the science instruments NASA uses to study our climate focus on how these gases affect the movement of infrared radiation through the atmosphere. From the measured impacts of increases in these gases, there is no question that increased greenhouse gas levels warm Earth in response.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nIce cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that Earth\u2019s climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly 10 times faster than the average rate of warming after an ice age. Carbon dioxide from human activities is increasing about 250 times faster than it did from natural sources after the last Ice Age.3\nThe planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and other human activities.4 Most of the warming occurred in the past 40 years, with the seven most recent years being the warmest. The years 2016 and 2020 are tied for the warmest year on record.5 Image credit: Ashwin Kumar, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic.\nThe ocean has absorbed much of this increased heat, with the top 100 meters (about 328 feet) of ocean showing warming of 0.67 degrees Fahrenheit (0.33 degrees Celsius) since 1969.6 Earth stores 90% of the extra energy in the ocean. Image credit: Kelsey Roberts/USGS\nThe Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass. Data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment show Greenland lost an average of 279 billion tons of ice per year between 1993 and 2019, while Antarctica lost about 148 billion tons of ice per year.7 Image: The Antarctic Peninsula, Credit: NASA\nGlaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world \u2014 including in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska, and Africa.8 Image: Miles Glacier, Alaska Image credit: NASA\nSatellite observations reveal that the amount of spring snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere has decreased over the past five decades and the snow is melting earlier.9 Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\nGlobal sea level rose about 8 inches (20 centimeters) in the last century.

He is the author of more than 200 scientific papers. From 1972 to 1982, he served as the Gordon McKay Professor of Dynamic Meteorology at Harvard University. In 1983, he was appointed as the Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he would remain until his retirement in 2013.[2][1] Lindzen has disputed the scientific consensus on climate change and criticizes what he has called \"climate alarmism\".[3][4]\nLindzen was born on February 8, 1940, in Webster, Massachusetts.[1] His father, a shoemaker, had fled Nazi Germany with his mother. Lindzen moved to The Bronx soon after his birth and grew up in a Jewish household in a predominantly Catholic neighborhood.[4][5]\nLindzen attended the Bronx High School of Science, where he won Regents' and National Merit Scholarships, then Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute before matriculating at Harvard University.[6] In 1960, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in physics, magna cum laude, followed by a Master of Science degree in applied mathematics in 1961 and a Ph.D. in applied mathematics in 1964.

While this claim may well be correct, there are no detailed temperature records extending back 100,000 years, so we don\u2019t know for sure.\nHere\u2019s what we can confidently say about when Earth was last this hot.\nScientists concluded a few years ago that Earth had entered a new climate state not seen in more than 100,000 years. As fellow climate scientist Nick McKay and I recently discussed in a scientific journal article, that conclusion was part of a climate assessment report published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2021.\nEarth was already more than 1 degree Celsius (1.8 Fahrenheit) warmer than preindustrial times, and the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere were high enough to assure temperatures would stay elevated for a long time.\nEarth\u2019s average temperature has exceeded 1 degree Celsius (1.8 F) above the preindustrial baseline. This new climate state will very likely persist for centuries as the warmest period in more than 100,000 years. The chart shows different reconstructions of temperature over time, with measured temperatures since 1850 and a projection to 2300 based on an intermediate emissions scenario. Chart by D.S. Kaufman and N.P. McKay, 2022, and published datasets/Author provided\nEven under the most optimistic scenarios of the future \u2013 in which humans stop burning fossil fuels and reduce other greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 average global temperature will very likely remain at least 1 C above preindustrial temperatures, and possibly much higher, for multiple centuries.\nThis new climate state, characterized by a multi-century global warming level of 1 C and higher, can be reliably compared with temperature reconstructions from the very distant past.\nTo reconstruct temperatures from times before thermometers, paleoclimate scientists rely on information stored in a variety of natural archives.\nThe most widespread archive going back many thousands of years is at the bottom of lakes and oceans, where an assortment of biological, chemical and physical evidence offers clues to the past. These materials build up continuously over time and can be analyzed by extracting a sediment core from the lake bed or ocean floor.\nThese sediment-based records are rich sources of information that have enabled paleoclimate scientists to reconstruct past global temperatures, but they have important limitations.\nFor one, bottom currents and burrowing organisms can mix the sediment, blurring any short-term temperature spikes. For another, the timeline for each record is not known precisely, so when multiple records are averaged together to estimate past global temperature, fine-scale fluctuations can be canceled out.\nBecause of this, paleoclimate scientists are reluctant to compare the long-term record of past temperature with short-term extremes.\nEarth\u2019s average global temperature has fluctuated between glacial and interglacial conditions in cycles lasting around 100,000 years, driven largely by slow and predictable changes in Earth\u2019s orbit with attendant changes in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. We are currently in an interglacial period that began around 12,000 years ago as ice sheets retreated and greenhouse gases rose.\nLooking at that 12,000-year interglacial period, global temperature averaged over multiple centuries might have peaked roughly around 6,000 years ago, but probably did not exceed the 1 C global warming level at that point, according to the IPCC report. Another study found that global average temperatures continued to increase across the interglacial period. This is a topic of active research.\nThat means we have to look farther back to find a time that might have been as warm as today.\nThe last glacial episode lasted nearly 100,000 years. There is no evidence that long-term global temperatures reached the preindustrial baseline anytime during that period.\nIf we look even farther back, to the previous interglacial period, which peaked around 125,000 years ago, we do find evidence of warmer temperatures. The evidence suggests the long-term average temperature was probably no more than 1.5 C (2.7 F) above preindustrial levels \u2013 not much more than the current global warming level.\nWithout rapid and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, the Earth is currently on course to reach temperatures of roughly 3 C (5.4 F) above preindustrial levels by the end of the century, and possibly quite a bit higher.\nAt that point, we would need to look back millions of years to find a climate state with temperatures as hot. That would take us back to the previous geologic epoch, the Pliocene, when the Earth\u2019s climate was a distant relative of the one that sustained the rise of agriculture and civilization.\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Content is not being updated or maintained, and some links may no longer work.\nDaily temperature swings of tens of degrees at a given location are common weather-driven events. But historically, when measurements of the daily high and low temperatures from many thousands of locations all over the world are averaged together over a whole year, the Earth's annual average temperature fluctuated by no more than a few tenths of a degree from year to year. In a geological context, a global-scale warming of 1.8\u00b0F (1\u00b0C) in less than 150 years is an unusually large temperature change in a relatively short span of time.\nOver the course of the 21st century, all parts of the globe are expected to warm, but the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projects more severe late-century changes under a higher-emissions scenario (RCP8.5) than a lower-emissions scenario (RCP2.6). In these maps, warm hues indicate rising temperatures. Stippling indicates regions where the multi-model change exceeds two standard deviations of internal variability, and where 90% or more of the models agree on the change sign. Adapted from Arblaster et al. 2013.\nIt's also important to recognize that Earth is not warming uniformly, nor is it expected to. Middle and high latitudes in general will warm more than the tropics, and land surface temperatures will rise more than ocean temperatures. Over the long term, land masses at the latitude of the United States are expected to warm much more than the global average. If global warming continues at an increasing rate, in several decades the world is likely to be warmer than it's been for over a million years, with unpredictable consequences for humans and the natural resources we depend on.\nHoegh-Guldberg, O., D.

He is the author of more than 200 scientific papers. From 1972 to 1982, he served as the Gordon McKay Professor of Dynamic Meteorology at Harvard University. In 1983, he was appointed as the Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he would remain until his retirement in 2013.[2][1] Lindzen has disputed the scientific consensus on climate change and criticizes what he has called \"climate alarmism\".[3][4]\nLindzen was born on February 8, 1940, in Webster, Massachusetts.[1] His father, a shoemaker, had fled Nazi Germany with his mother. Lindzen moved to The Bronx soon after his birth and grew up in a Jewish household in a predominantly Catholic neighborhood.[4][5]\nLindzen attended the Bronx High School of Science, where he won Regents' and National Merit Scholarships, then Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute before matriculating at Harvard University.[6] In 1960, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in physics, magna cum laude, followed by a Master of Science degree in applied mathematics in 1961 and a Ph.D. in applied mathematics in 1964. His doctoral thesis, Radiative and photochemical processes in strato- and mesospheric dynamics, was about the interactions of ozone photochemistry, radiative transfer, and dynamics in the middle atmosphere.[7]\nLindzen has published papers on Hadley circulation, monsoon meteorology, planetary atmospheres, hydrodynamic instability, mid-latitude weather, global heat transport, the water cycle, ice ages and seasonal atmospheric effects. His main contribution to the academic literature on anthropogenic climate change is his proposal of the iris hypothesis in 2001, with co-authors Ming-Dah Chou and Arthur Y. Hou.[8][9]\nLindzen is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the Science, Health, and Economic Advisory Council at the Annapolis Center for Science-Based Public Policy. He joined MIT in 1983, prior to which he held positions at the University of Washington (1964\u201365), the Institute for Theoretical Meteorology at the University of Copenhagen, the University of Oslo (1965\u201367), the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) (1966\u201367), and the University of Chicago (1968\u201372). From 1972 to 1982, he served as the Gordon McKay Professor of Dynamic Meteorology at Harvard University. Lindzen also briefly held a position of visiting lecturer at UCLA in 1967.[10]\nAs of January 2010, his publications list included 230 papers and articles published between 1965 and 2008, with five in process for 2009. He is the author of a standard textbook on atmospheric dynamics, and co-authored the monograph Atmospheric Tides with Sydney Chapman.[11]\nHe was Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Meteorology at MIT from 1983,[1] until his retirement which was reported in the Spring 2013 newsletter of MIT's Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS).[2] On December 27, 2013, the Cato Institute announced his appointment as a Distinguished Senior Fellow in its Center for the Study of Science.[12]\nLindzen's early work was concerned with ozone photochemistry, the aerodynamics of the middle atmosphere, the theory of atmospheric tides, and planetary waves. His work in these areas led him to a number of fundamental scientific discoveries, including the discovery of negative equivalent depths in classical tidal theory, explanations for both the quasi-biennial oscillation of the Earth's stratosphere and the four-day period of the superrotation of the Venus atmosphere above the cloud top.\nHis PhD thesis of 1964 concerned the interactions of ozone photochemistry, radiative transfer and the dynamics of the middle atmosphere. This formed the basis of his seminal Radiative and Photochemical Processes in Mesospheric Dynamics that was published in four parts in the Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences between 1965 and 1966.[13][14][15][16][17] The first of these, Part I: Models for Radiative and Photochemical Processes, was co-authored with his Harvard colleague and former PhD thesis advisor, Richard M.

Any decadal scale changes in warming rate are however obfuscated by internal variability. Here we show that the surface temperature increase through the recent La Nina influenced years (2022) is consistent with the 50-year trend of 0.18 \u00b0C/decade. We use an Earth System Model based tool to filter out modulations to the warming rate by sea-surface temperature patterns and find consistent warming rates in four major global temperature data series. However, we also find clear indications, in all observational series, of a step-up in warming rate since around 1990. CMIP6 models generally do not capture this observed combination of long-term warming rate and recent increase.\nThe major agencies tracking global surface temperature anomalies (GSTA) rank 2022 as the 5\u20136th warmest on record1,2,3. That global warming continues is clear4, and apparent in the markedly strengthening impacts felt around the world5. Satellites and ocean data also document a strengthening uptake of energy in the Earth system, related to an increasing imbalance between incoming solar radiation and energy re-emitted to space6,7. The recent rate of global mean surface warming\u2014a crucial measure for tracking the progress of climate change and the effects of future mitigation efforts\u2014is however less clear8,9. Primarily, this is due to the influence of internal variability on year-to-year temperature anomalies. 2022 saw strong, prevailing La Nina conditions in the Pacific, which is known to cool the surface, globally, by up to several tenths of a degree Celsius on annual mean. The same was true for 2021, and parts of 2020; an uncommonly long period of cool conditions in the Pacific. This leads to an expectation of observed GSTA values below the full anthropogenic warming since 1850\u20131900, and an apparent short-term slowdown in the rate of surface warming.\nConcurrently, the rate of change, and balance between components of, anthropogenic radiative forcing is also changing4. Atmospheric concentrations of CH4 have increased strongly in the recent decade, while the increase in anthropogenic CO2 emissions, the primary driver of warming, has slowed to ~1%/year, relative to ~3%/year in the period 1990\u2013201010. Emissions of SO2, precursor of cooling sulfate aerosols, have decreased strongly over the last decade, largely due to strong Chinese efforts to combat air pollution11. Because of the rapid and potentially non-linear influence of aerosol emission changes on surface temperatures8, and the remaining uncertainty on the total anthropogenic aerosol forcing of the climate12, the near-term GSTA evolution can provide a crucial test of the strength of the aerosol-climate interaction. Tracking the rate of change of global surface temperatures is therefore crucial, on both short and long time scales.\nRecently, we published a method for filtering out parts of the influence of sea-surface temperature (SST) patterns on the observed global mean surface temperature anomaly13. Briefly, a model-based transfer function is used to relate an SST fluctuation in one location to a global mean effect. This function is in turn applied to the realized, detrended SST pattern for a given month or year, to arrive at a total influence on the GSTA from all ocean areas, which can subsequently be filtered out (Methods). This reduction of the influence of internal variability is an advantage over simple running means, since it includes a physical mechanism linking the SSTs to the GSTA. It is also distinct from common multi-regression approaches that primarily use an ENSO index to quantify ocean variability14, and from formal detection and attribution techniques as it does not rely on forcing estimates and dedicated simulations.\nApplying the method to the HadCRUT5 data series, we found that for the (then) last 50 years (1971\u20132020), global warming had progressed at an overall rate of 0.19 \u00b0C/decade13. Here, we update this analysis to include the La Nina influenced years of 2021 and 2022, and show how internal variability has recently affected seasonal and annual global mean temperatures. We then use the method to revisit observed and modelled changes in the rate of global mean surface warming over the last 50-, 20- and 10-year periods.\nIn Fig. 1, we present a breakdown of the SST influence on the GSTA in HadCRUT5, from 1850 and through the last calendar year, including an in-depth look at the last 10 years. The warming influence of the 2016 El Ni\u00f1o is clearly visible, as is the La Ni\u00f1a influence on 2021 and 2022. The annual mean SST related influence on 2021, in our method was found to be \u22120.09 \u00b0C. 2022 was also influenced by the La Nina conditions, but to a lesser degree; we find a cooling of \u22120.04 \u00b0C. For comparison, the El Nino influence in 2016 was +0.16 \u00b0C. In all, this places 2022 direct\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Two-thirds of the warming has occurred since 1975.\n\nFull Page Content:\nThis website is an ARCHIVED version of NOAA Climate.gov as of June 25, 2025. Content is not being updated or maintained, and some links may no longer work.\nDaily temperature swings of tens of degrees at a given location are common weather-driven events. But historically, when measurements of the daily high and low temperatures from many thousands of locations all over the world are averaged together over a whole year, the Earth's annual average temperature fluctuated by no more than a few tenths of a degree from year to year. In a geological context, a global-scale warming of 1.8\u00b0F (1\u00b0C) in less than 150 years is an unusually large temperature change in a relatively short span of time.\nOver the course of the 21st century, all parts of the globe are expected to warm, but the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projects more severe late-century changes under a higher-emissions scenario (RCP8.5) than a lower-emissions scenario (RCP2.6). In these maps, warm hues indicate rising temperatures. Stippling indicates regions where the multi-model change exceeds two standard deviations of internal variability, and where 90% or more of the models agree on the change sign. Adapted from Arblaster et al. 2013.\nIt's also important to recognize that Earth is not warming uniformly, nor is it expected to. Middle and high latitudes in general will warm more than the tropics, and land surface temperatures will rise more than ocean temperatures. Over the long term, land masses at the latitude of the United States are expected to warm much more than the global average. If global warming continues at an increasing rate, in several decades the world is likely to be warmer than it's been for over a million years, with unpredictable consequences for humans and the natural resources we depend on.\nHoegh-Guldberg, O., D.

At the heart of the Trump Administration\u2019s attempt to dislodge this cornerstone of federal climate action is a polished piece of fossil fuel disinformation: a sham report by a so-called Climate Working Group convened in secret by US Department of Energy (DOE) Secretary Chris Wright and US EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.\nHundreds of experts submitted comments exposing the report\u2019s misleading use of data and cherry-picked conclusions. The American Meteorological Society issued a powerful statement identifying five foundational flaws that place the report at odds with scientific principles and practices. Texas A&M University climate scientist Andy Dessler worked with 85 experts and compiled a 459-page response to the report, exposing fundamental errors that misrepresent the overwhelming evidence of human-caused climate change. UCS filed comments underscoring the ways this deeply flawed DOE-commissioned document distorts science, delays action, and undermines public understanding of the crisis we are facing.\nTogether with the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), UCS is suing to enforce federal legal requirements that apply to the committee that wrote the report. The lawsuit\u2014against the DOE and Secretary Christopher Wright in his official capacity as head of that department, the EPA and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in his official capacity as head of that agency, and the Climate Working Group\u2014argues that the establishment and use of the Climate Working Group violates the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), which requires fairly balanced viewpoints, public participation and transparency for committees like this one that advise the federal government on policy. On September 17, the court granted partial summary judgment as sought by UCS and EDF, ruling that the Climate Working Group is not exempt from FACA under an exception the government had argued should apply. The case is ongoing.\nThe scientific critiques are extensive and compelling, and they prompted me to scrutinize the authors behind the report. Who wrote it, and what do their records tell us about why the science they produced was so deeply flawed? Not surprisingly, these scientists\u2019 names and viewpoints were familiar from previous research by UCS and others, congressional testimony, and other public appearances.\nJohn Christy, a professor at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, has repeatedly advanced analyses of atmospheric data that independent researchers have shown to be flawed. Even after corrections brought those records into line with surface temperatures and model projections, Christy has continued promoting outdated interpretations.\nAt the same time, Christy has been a familiar presence in fossil fuel industry-funded circles including the Heartland Institute, Cato Institute, Competitive Enterprise Institute, Independent Institute, Global Warming Policy Foundation, and George C. Marshall Institute. He was even recommended for a federal climate role by ExxonMobil\u2019s top lobbyist in the early 2000s.\nAs noted by Inside Climate News, he has frequently been invited to testify before Congress by \u201cRepublican lawmakers looking to cast doubt on the science of human-caused climate change.\u201d In 2013, for example, Christy testified before the House Science Committee, chaired by then-Representative Lamar Smith. Smith, a recipient of significant fossil fuel industry campaign contributions, surrounded himself with staff tied to industry lobbying and PR firms. Under Smith\u2019s leadership, the House Science Committee even subpoenaed UCS as part of an effort to intimidate scientists and accountability advocates.\nChristy\u2019s role in the Climate Working Group\u2019s report likely ensured that long-debunked science was presented as if it were credible dissent.\nSteve Koonin has become known for portraying climate science as \u201cunsettled.\u201d His arguments consistently highlight uncertainty while downplaying the weight of evidence that climate change\u2014caused primarily by burning oil, gas, and coal\u2014is happening. This framing\u2014promoted by ExxonMobil in a notorious 2000 New York Times advertorial\u2014has been widely criticized by Koonin\u2019s scientific peers for misrepresenting the state of knowledge.\nKoonin\u2019s career also links directly to fossil fuels. He was BP\u2019s Chief Scientist for five years and later joined think tanks such as the Hoover Institution, which received $430,000 from ExxonMobil from 1998-2019, and the American Enterprise Institute, which has received millions of dollars in funding from ExxonMobil and over $2 million from Koch-related foundations. The selective way Koonin treats evidence aligns neatly with the interests of polluting industries.\nRoy Spencer, another researcher at the University of Alabama, has co-authored analyses that independent scientists found contained serious errors. For example, a paper he co-wrote was so flawed that the journal editor resigned, acknowledging it should not have been published. Spencer was a signatory of the 2017 petition organized by retired MIT professor Richard Lindzen of the Cato Institute urging President Trump to pull out of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The claims in the petition were debunked by UCS.\nSpencer also has close ties to networks that deny climate science, including the Cornwall Alliance, which the Guardian says \u201cessentially believes God wouldn\u2019t let damaging climate change happen,\u201d and which, according to DeSmog, \u201cclaims environmentalism is \u2018one of the greatest threats to society and the church today.\u2019\u201d Spencer was also formerly a visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation.\nAccord\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Any decadal scale changes in warming rate are however obfuscated by internal variability. Here we show that the surface temperature increase through the recent La Nina influenced years (2022) is consistent with the 50-year trend of 0.18 \u00b0C/decade. We use an Earth System Model based tool to filter out modulations to the warming rate by sea-surface temperature patterns and find consistent warming rates in four major global temperature data series. However, we also find clear indications, in all observational series, of a step-up in warming rate since around 1990. CMIP6 models generally do not capture this observed combination of long-term warming rate and recent increase.\nThe major agencies tracking global surface temperature anomalies (GSTA) rank 2022 as the 5\u20136th warmest on record1,2,3. That global warming continues is clear4, and apparent in the markedly strengthening impacts felt around the world5. Satellites and ocean data also document a strengthening uptake of energy in the Earth system, related to an increasing imbalance between incoming solar radiation and energy re-emitted to space6,7. The recent rate of global mean surface warming\u2014a crucial measure for tracking the progress of climate change and the effects of future mitigation efforts\u2014is however less clear8,9. Primarily, this is due to the influence of internal variability on year-to-year temperature anomalies. 2022 saw strong, prevailing La Nina conditions in the Pacific, which is known to cool the surface, globally, by up to several tenths of a degree Celsius on annual mean. The same was true for 2021, and parts of 2020; an uncommonly long period of cool conditions in the Pacific. This leads to an expectation of observed GSTA values below the full anthropogenic warming since 1850\u20131900, and an apparent short-term slowdown in the rate of surface warming.\nConcurrently, the rate of change, and balance between components of, anthropogenic radiative forcing is also changing4. Atmospheric concentrations of CH4 have increased strongly in the recent decade, while the increase in anthropogenic CO2 emissions, the primary driver of warming, has slowed to ~1%/year, relative to ~3%/year in the period 1990\u2013201010. Emissions of SO2, precursor of cooling sulfate aerosols, have decreased strongly over the last decade, largely due to strong Chinese efforts to combat air pollution11. Because of the rapid and potentially non-linear influence of aerosol emission changes on surface temperatures8, and the remaining uncertainty on the total anthropogenic aerosol forcing of the climate12, the near-term GSTA evolution can provide a crucial test of the strength of the aerosol-climate interaction. Tracking the rate of change of global surface temperatures is therefore crucial, on both short and long time scales.\nRecently, we published a method for filtering out parts of the influence of sea-surface temperature (SST) patterns on the observed global mean surface temperature anomaly13. Briefly, a model-based transfer function is used to relate an SST fluctuation in one location to a global mean effect. This function is in turn applied to the realized, detrended SST pattern for a given month or year, to arrive at a total influence on the GSTA from all ocean areas, which can subsequently be filtered out (Methods). This reduction of the influence of internal variability is an advantage over simple running means, since it includes a physical mechanism linking the SSTs to the GSTA. It is also distinct from common multi-regression approaches that primarily use an ENSO index to quantify ocean variability14, and from formal detection and attribution techniques as it does not rely on forcing estimates and dedicated simulations.\nApplying the method to the HadCRUT5 data series, we found that for the (then) last 50 years (1971\u20132020), global warming had progressed at an overall rate of 0.19 \u00b0C/decade13. Here, we update this analysis to include the La Nina influenced years of 2021 and 2022, and show how internal variability has recently affected seasonal and annual global mean temperatures. We then use the method to revisit observed and modelled changes in the rate of global mean surface warming over the last 50-, 20- and 10-year periods.\nIn Fig. 1, we present a breakdown of the SST influence on the GSTA in HadCRUT5, from 1850 and through the last calendar year, including an in-depth look at the last 10 years. The warming influence of the 2016 El Ni\u00f1o is clearly visible, as is the La Ni\u00f1a influence on 2021 and 2022. The annual mean SST related influence on 2021, in our method was found to be \u22120.09 \u00b0C. 2022 was also influenced by the La Nina conditions, but to a lesser degree; we find a cooling of \u22120.04 \u00b0C. For comparison, the El Nino influence in 2016 was +0.16 \u00b0C. In all, this places 2022 direct\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Any decadal scale changes in warming rate are however obfuscated by internal variability. Here we show that the surface temperature increase through the recent La Nina influenced years (2022) is consistent with the 50-year trend of 0.18 \u00b0C/decade. We use an Earth System Model based tool to filter out modulations to the warming rate by sea-surface temperature patterns and find consistent warming rates in four major global temperature data series. However, we also find clear indications, in all observational series, of a step-up in warming rate since around 1990. CMIP6 models generally do not capture this observed combination of long-term warming rate and recent increase.\nThe major agencies tracking global surface temperature anomalies (GSTA) rank 2022 as the 5\u20136th warmest on record1,2,3. That global warming continues is clear4, and apparent in the markedly strengthening impacts felt around the world5. Satellites and ocean data also document a strengthening uptake of energy in the Earth system, related to an increasing imbalance between incoming solar radiation and energy re-emitted to space6,7. The recent rate of global mean surface warming\u2014a crucial measure for tracking the progress of climate change and the effects of future mitigation efforts\u2014is however less clear8,9. Primarily, this is due to the influence of internal variability on year-to-year temperature anomalies. 2022 saw strong, prevailing La Nina conditions in the Pacific, which is known to cool the surface, globally, by up to several tenths of a degree Celsius on annual mean. The same was true for 2021, and parts of 2020; an uncommonly long period of cool conditions in the Pacific. This leads to an expectation of observed GSTA values below the full anthropogenic warming since 1850\u20131900, and an apparent short-term slowdown in the rate of surface warming.\nConcurrently, the rate of change, and balance between components of, anthropogenic radiative forcing is also changing4. Atmospheric concentrations of CH4 have increased strongly in the recent decade, while the increase in anthropogenic CO2 emissions, the primary driver of warming, has slowed to ~1%/year, relative to ~3%/year in the period 1990\u2013201010. Emissions of SO2, precursor of cooling sulfate aerosols, have decreased strongly over the last decade, largely due to strong Chinese efforts to combat air pollution11. Because of the rapid and potentially non-linear influence of aerosol emission changes on surface temperatures8, and the remaining uncertainty on the total anthropogenic aerosol forcing of the climate12, the near-term GSTA evolution can provide a crucial test of the strength of the aerosol-climate interaction. Tracking the rate of change of global surface temperatures is therefore crucial, on both short and long time scales.\nRecently, we published a method for filtering out parts of the influence of sea-surface temperature (SST) patterns on the observed global mean surface temperature anomaly13. Briefly, a model-based transfer function is used to relate an SST fluctuation in one location to a global mean effect. This function is in turn applied to the realized, detrended SST pattern for a given month or year, to arrive at a total influence on the GSTA from all ocean areas, which can subsequently be filtered out (Methods). This reduction of the influence of internal variability is an advantage over simple running means, since it includes a physical mechanism linking the SSTs to the GSTA. It is also distinct from common multi-regression approaches that primarily use an ENSO index to quantify ocean variability14, and from formal detection and attribution techniques as it does not rely on forcing estimates and dedicated simulations.\nApplying the method to the HadCRUT5 data series, we found that for the (then) last 50 years (1971\u20132020), global warming had progressed at an overall rate of 0.19 \u00b0C/decade13. Here, we update this analysis to include the La Nina influenced years of 2021 and 2022, and show how internal variability has recently affected seasonal and annual global mean temperatures. We then use the method to revisit observed and modelled changes in the rate of global mean surface warming over the last 50-, 20- and 10-year periods.\nIn Fig. 1, we present a breakdown of the SST influence on the GSTA in HadCRUT5, from 1850 and through the last calendar year, including an in-depth look at the last 10 years. The warming influence of the 2016 El Ni\u00f1o is clearly visible, as is the La Ni\u00f1a influence on 2021 and 2022.

Tim Lambert, \"Richard ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nThis month, the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) filed comments and submitted a letter signed by more than 1,000 scientists opposing the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA\u2019s) proposal to rescind the 2009 Endangerment Finding, which affirmed the agency\u2019s responsibility and obligation under the Clean Air Act to regulate the health-harming heat-trapping emissions driving climate change. At the heart of the Trump Administration\u2019s attempt to dislodge this cornerstone of federal climate action is a polished piece of fossil fuel disinformation: a sham report by a so-called Climate Working Group convened in secret by US Department of Energy (DOE) Secretary Chris Wright and US EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.\nHundreds of experts submitted comments exposing the report\u2019s misleading use of data and cherry-picked conclusions. The American Meteorological Society issued a powerful statement identifying five foundational flaws that place the report at odds with scientific principles and practices. Texas A&M University climate scientist Andy Dessler worked with 85 experts and compiled a 459-page response to the report, exposing fundamental errors that misrepresent the overwhelming evidence of human-caused climate change. UCS filed comments underscoring the ways this deeply flawed DOE-commissioned document distorts science, delays action, and undermines public understanding of the crisis we are facing.\nTogether with the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), UCS is suing to enforce federal legal requirements that apply to the committee that wrote the report. The lawsuit\u2014against the DOE and Secretary Christopher Wright in his official capacity as head of that department, the EPA and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in his official capacity as head of that agency, and the Climate Working Group\u2014argues that the establishment and use of the Climate Working Group violates the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), which requires fairly balanced viewpoints, public participation and transparency for committees like this one that advise the federal government on policy. On September 17, the court granted partial summary judgment as sought by UCS and EDF, ruling that the Climate Working Group is not exempt from FACA under an exception the government had argued should apply. The case is ongoing.\nThe scientific critiques are extensive and compelling, and they prompted me to scrutinize the authors behind the report. Who wrote it, and what do their records tell us about why the science they produced was so deeply flawed? Not surprisingly, these scientists\u2019 names and viewpoints were familiar from previous research by UCS and others, congressional testimony, and other public appearances.\nJohn Christy, a professor at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, has repeatedly advanced analyses of atmospheric data that independent researchers have shown to be flawed. Even after corrections brought those records into line with surface temperatures and model projections, Christy has continued promoting outdated interpretations.\nAt the same time, Christy has been a familiar presence in fossil fuel industry-funded circles including the Heartland Institute, Cato Institute, Competitive Enterprise Institute, Independent Institute, Global Warming Policy Foundation, and George C. Marshall Institute. He was even recommended for a federal climate role by ExxonMobil\u2019s top lobbyist in the early 2000s.\nAs noted by Inside Climate News, he has frequently been invited to testify before Congress by \u201cRepublican lawmakers looking to cast doubt on the science of human-caused climate change.\u201d In 2013, for example, Christy testified before the House Science Committee, chaired by then-Representative Lamar Smith. Smith, a recipient of significant fossil fuel industry campaign contributions, surrounded himself with staff tied to industry lobbying and PR firms. Under Smith\u2019s leadership, the House Science Committee even subpoenaed UCS as part of an effort to intimidate scientists and accountability advocates.\nChristy\u2019s role in the Climate Working Group\u2019s report likely ensured that long-debunked science was presented as if it were credible dissent.\nSteve Koonin has become known for portraying climate science as \u201cunsettled.\u201d His arguments consistently highlight uncertainty while downplaying the weight of evidence that climate change\u2014caused primarily by burning oil, gas, and coal\u2014is happening. This framing\u2014promoted by ExxonMobil in a notorious 2000 New York Times advertorial\u2014has been widely criticized by Koonin\u2019s scientific peers for misrepresenting the state of knowledge.\nKoonin\u2019s career also links directly to fossil fuels. He was BP\u2019s Chief Scientist for five years and later joined think tanks such as the Hoover Institution, which received $430,000 from ExxonMobil from 1998-2019, and the American Enterprise Institute, which has received millions of dollars in funding from ExxonMobil and over $2 million from Koch-related foundations. The selective way Koonin treats evidence aligns neatly with the interests of polluting industries.\nRoy Spencer, another researcher at the University of Alabama, has co-authored analyses that independent scientists found contained serious errors. For example, a paper he co-wrote was so flawed that the journal editor resigned, acknowledging it should not have been published. Spencer was a signatory of the 2017 petition organized by retired MIT professor Richard Lindzen of the Cato Institute urging President Trump to pull out of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The claims in the petition were debunked by UCS.\nSpencer also has close ties to networks that deny climate science, including the Cornwall Alliance, which the Guardian says \u201cessentially believes God wouldn\u2019t let damaging climate change happen,\u201d and which, according to DeSmog, \u201cclaims environmentalism is \u2018one of the greatest threats to society and the church today.\u2019\u201d Spencer was also formerly a visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation.\nAccord\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

These scientists were interested chiefly in the possibility that a lower level of carbon dioxide gas might explain the ice ages of the distant past. At the turn of the century, Svante Arrhenius calculated that emissions from human industry might someday bring a global warming. Other scientists dismissed his idea as faulty. In 1938, G.S. Callendar argued that the level of carbon dioxide was climbing and raising global temperature, but most scientists found his arguments implausible. It was almost by chance that a few researchers in the 1950s discovered that global warming truly was possible. In the early 1960s, C.D. Keeling measured the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere: it was rising fast. Researchers began to take an interest, struggling to understand how the level of carbon dioxide had changed in the past, and how the level was influenced by chemical and biological forces. By 2000, computer calculations along with evidence from ancient climates showed unequivocally that human emissions of the gas were raising Earth's temperature. Attention turned to studying how the gas was emitted or taken up by natural systems as well as by humanity, how far the temperature would rise, and what could be done to avoid disaster by curbing emissions.

These scientists were interested chiefly in the possibility that a lower level of carbon dioxide gas might explain the ice ages of the distant past. At the turn of the century, Svante Arrhenius calculated that emissions from human industry might someday bring a global warming. Other scientists dismissed his idea as faulty. In 1938, G.S. Callendar argued that the level of carbon dioxide was climbing and raising global temperature, but most scientists found his arguments implausible. It was almost by chance that a few researchers in the 1950s discovered that global warming truly was possible. In the early 1960s, C.D. Keeling measured the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere: it was rising fast. Researchers began to take an interest, struggling to understand how the level of carbon dioxide had changed in the past, and how the level was influenced by chemical and biological forces. By 2000, computer calculations along with evidence from ancient climates showed unequivocally that human emissions of the gas were raising Earth's temperature. Attention turned to studying how the gas was emitted or taken up by natural systems as well as by humanity, how far the temperature would rise, and what could be done to avoid disaster by curbing emissions.

Some of the incoming sunlight is reflected directly back into space, especially by bright surfaces such as ice and clouds, and the rest is absorbed by the surface and the atmosphere. Much of this absorbed solar energy is re-emitted as heat (longwave or infrared radiation). The atmosphere in turn absorbs and re-radiates heat, some of which escapes to space. Any disturbance to this balance of incoming and outgoing energy will affect the climate. For example, small changes in the output of energy from the Sun will affect this balance directly.\nIf all heat energy emitted from the surface passed through the atmosphere directly into space, Earth\u2019s average surface temperature would be tens of degrees colder than today. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, including water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, act to make the surface much warmer than this because they absorb and emit heat energy in all directions (including downwards), keeping Earth\u2019s surface and lower atmosphere warm [Figure B1]. Without this greenhouse effect, life as we know it could not have evolved on our planet. Adding more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere makes it even more effective at preventing heat from escaping into space. When the energy leaving is less than the energy entering, Earth warms until a new balance is established.\nGreenhouse gases emitted by human activities alter Earth\u2019s energy balance and thus its climate. Humans also affect climate by changing the nature of the land surfaces (for example by clearing forests for farming) and through the emission of pollutants that affect the amount and type of particles in the atmosphere.\nScientists have determined that, when all human and natural factors are considered, Earth\u2019s climate balance has been altered towards warming, with the biggest contributor being increases in CO2.\nFigure b1. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, including water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, absorb heat energy and emit it in all directions (including downwards), keeping Earth\u2019s surface and lower atmosphere warm. Adding more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere enhances the effect, making Earth\u2019s surface and lower atmosphere even warmer. Image based on a figure from US EPA.\nThe atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide have increased significantly since the Industrial Revolution began. In the case of carbon dioxide, the average concentration measured at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii has risen from 316 parts per million (ppm) in 1959 (the first full year of data available) to more than 411 ppm in 2019 [Figure B2]. The same rates of increase have since been recorded at numerous other stations worldwide. Since preindustrial times, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 has increased by over 40%, methane has increased by more than 150%, and nitrous oxide has increased by roughly 20%. More than half of the increase in CO2 has occurred since 1970. Increases in all three gases contribute to warming of Earth, with the increase in CO2 playing the largest role. See page B3 to learn about the sources of human emitted greenhouse gases.

Analysis of air trapped inside ice that has been accumulating over time in Antarctica shows that the CO2 concentration began to increase significantly in the 19th century [Figure B3], after staying in the range of 260 to 280 ppm for the previous 10,000 years. Ice core records extending back 800,000 years show that during that time, CO2 concentrations remained within the range of 170 to 300 ppm throughout many \u201cice age\u201d cycles - learn about the ice ages - and no concentration above 300 ppm is seen in ice core records until the past 200 years.\nMeasurements of the forms (isotopes) of carbon in the modern atmosphere show a clear fingerprint of the addition of \u201cold\u201d carbon (depleted in natural radioactive 14C) coming from the combustion of fossil fuels (as opposed to \u201cnewer\u201d carbon coming from living systems). In addition, it is known that human activities (excluding land use changes) currently emit an estimated 10 billion tonnes of carbon each year, mostly by burning fossil fuels, which is more than enough to explain the observed increase in concentration.

For example, small changes in the output of energy from the Sun will affect this balance directly.\nIf all heat energy emitted from the surface passed through the atmosphere directly into space, Earth\u2019s average surface temperature would be tens of degrees colder than today. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, including water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, act to make the surface much warmer than this because they absorb and emit heat energy in all directions (including downwards), keeping Earth\u2019s surface and lower atmosphere warm [Figure B1].
