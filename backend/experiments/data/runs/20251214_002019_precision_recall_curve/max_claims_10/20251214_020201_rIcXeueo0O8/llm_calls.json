    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\n[Music] [Music] we can think of the atmosphere as a mix of all sorts of gases that surrounds our planet some gases that humans produce can have bad effects on the planet including changing the climate and weather many of the human produced gases are called greenhouse gases these are gases that trap heat and energy from the Sun hi my name is Eric I'm an atmospheric scientist I study climate and greenhouse gases my group's research we really try to understand what's impact in the atmosphere and how that impacts climate Eric and his team study the atmosphere and measure the levels of gases that make it up including greenhouse gases the goals are to better understand where harmful gases are coming from but first they have to collect gases in the atmosphere and to do this they collect samples of air using special tools our instruments are designed to measure the contents of the atmosphere much like weather station would measure wind or rainfall or snowfall our instruments are designed to measure the molecules the components of the air that were actually in these instruments are able to take snapshots of the amount of different gases in the atmosphere at a given time which helps scientists investigate sources of greenhouse gases but since Eric and his team are thinking about the atmosphere they have an interesting approach to collecting their samples we have instrumentation that will put in different places sometimes we'll put it on an airplane and we'll actually fly the airplane around to different regions that were interested in studying the sources will collect air into inlets on the side of the airplane and actually measure it on instruments in the airplane by collecting samples in flight they are able to identify different emission sources that may not be measurable on the ground pretty cool but how does collecting air above the ground tell us about what is happening on the ground we can think about it this bees fly around from flower to flower as they fly pollen gets attached to them if we looked at a bee after a day of flying around we would be able to tell where it had been by looking at the types of pollen it collected Eric and his team are kind of like bees they fly around collecting samples of air and the samples are able to tell us about what is in the air they spend a lot of time flying and collecting samples over farms for this project we very much want to understand the impacts of how we grow our crops on the atmosphere so in order to grow crops you need to plant seeds you might put quite a lot of fertilizer down a lot of the nutrients from fertilizer going to the growing of the crops but not all of the nutrients make their way into the crops and the number of them are lost to the atmosphere by focusing on flying over farms they are able to tell if the fertilizers that farmers are using are good or bad for the atmosphere as we get towards answers we can help inform farmers on what our optimal practices to have them both get their best crop yields but minimize the losses to the atmosphere but their research doesn't just stop at farms they also fly over cities and other areas or fly downwind of cities to try to understand how much is being emitted from all the cars and vehicles in the city how much is coming out of landfills and power plants this research is important because in order to understand how the atmosphere is changing we have to understand what is making it change this research helps us determine where the problem is so we can fix it but don't let just the scientist do it all themselves you can help reduce your impact on the earth too so if one is concerned about what impacts you have on the atmosphere there are different actions that can be taken the most important thing is to simply be cognizant and aware of what you're doing being aware of subtle things even light bulbs on leaving the TV on when you're not watching it all of those small things do add up but there's also simply power being aware of the problem and then collective action that can come out of that do you want to be a scientist like Eric and his team try making your own sampling device [Music]",

About half the light energy reaching Earth's atmosphere passes through the air and clouds to the surface, where it is absorbed and radiated in the form of infrared heat. About 90% of this heat is then absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-radiated, slowing heat loss to space.\nA vital component of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide (CO2) is released through natural processes (like volcanic eruptions) and through human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation.\nLike many atmospheric gases, methane comes from both natural and human-caused sources. Methane comes from plant-matter breakdown in wetlands and is also released from landfills and rice farming. Livestock animals emit methane from their digestion and manure. Leaks from fossil fuel production and transportation are another major source of methane, and natural gas is 70% to 90% methane.\nA potent greenhouse gas produced by farming practices, nitrous oxide is released during commercial and organic fertilizer production and use. Nitrous oxide also comes from burning fossil fuels and burning vegetation and has increased by 18% in the last 100 years.\nThese chemical compounds do not exist in nature \u2013 they are entirely of industrial origin.

This increase happens because the coal or oil burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the air to make CO2. To a lesser extent, clearing of land for agriculture, industry, and other human activities has increased concentrations of greenhouse gases.\nThe industrial activities that our modern civilization depends upon have raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels by nearly 50% since 17502. This increase is due to human activities, because scientists can see a distinctive isotopic fingerprint in the atmosphere.\nIn its Sixth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, composed of scientific experts from countries all over the world, concluded that it is unequivocal that the increase of CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere over the industrial era is the result of human activities and that human influence is the principal driver of many changes observed across the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nThe panel's AR6 Working Group I (WGI) Summary for Policymakers report is online at https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/.\nScientists use a metric called Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) to measure the changes in energy the Earth receives from the Sun.

    "input_prompt": "Claim:\nHuman-produced gases can have bad effects on the planet, including changing the climate and weather.\n\nArticle Title:\nHeat-Trapping Pollution - Climate Central\n\nGoogle Search Snippet:\nCarbon dioxide accounts for about 75% of global human-caused greenhouse gas emissions and has contributed the most to cumulative warming.\n\nFull Page Content:\nHuman activities are driving the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century.\nScientists attribute the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century to the human expansion of the \"greenhouse effect\"1 \u2014 warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth toward space.\nLife on Earth depends on energy coming from the Sun. About half the light energy reaching Earth's atmosphere passes through the air and clouds to the surface, where it is absorbed and radiated in the form of infrared heat. About 90% of this heat is then absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-radiated, slowing heat loss to space.\nA vital component of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide (CO2) is released through natural processes (like volcanic eruptions) and through human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation.\nLike many atmospheric gases, methane comes from both natural and human-caused sources. Methane comes from plant-matter breakdown in wetlands and is also released from landfills and rice farming. Livestock animals emit methane from their digestion and manure. Leaks from fossil fuel production and transportation are another major source of methane, and natural gas is 70% to 90% methane.\nA potent greenhouse gas produced by farming practices, nitrous oxide is released during commercial and organic fertilizer production and use. Nitrous oxide also comes from burning fossil fuels and burning vegetation and has increased by 18% in the last 100 years.\nThese chemical compounds do not exist in nature \u2013 they are entirely of industrial origin. They were used as refrigerants, solvents (a substance that dissolves others), and spray can propellants.\nFORCING: Something acting upon Earth's climate that causes a change in how energy flows through it (such as long-lasting, heat-trapping gases - also known as greenhouse gases). These gases slow outgoing heat in the atmosphere and cause the planet to warm.\nWater vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas, but because the warming ocean increases the amount of it in our atmosphere, it is not a direct cause of climate change. Credit: John Fowler on Unsplash\nFEEDBACKS: A process where something is either amplified or reduced as time goes on, such as water vapor increasing as Earth warms leading to even more warming.\nOver the last century, burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). This increase happens because the coal or oil burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the air to make CO2. To a lesser extent, clearing of land for agriculture, industry, and other human activities has increased concentrations of greenhouse gases.\nThe industrial activities that our modern civilization depends upon have raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels by nearly 50% since 17502. This increase is due to human activities, because scientists can see a distinctive isotopic fingerprint in the atmosphere.\nIn its Sixth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, composed of scientific experts from countries all over the world, concluded that it is unequivocal that the increase of CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere over the industrial era is the result of human activities and that human influence is the principal driver of many changes observed across the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nThe panel's AR6 Working Group I (WGI) Summary for Policymakers report is online at https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/.\nScientists use a metric called Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) to measure the changes in energy the Earth receives from the Sun. TSI incorporates the 11-year solar cycle and solar flares/storms from the Sun's surface.\nStudies show that solar variability has played a role in past climate changes. For example, a decrease in solar activity coupled with increased volcanic activity helped trigger the Little Ice Age.\nBut several lines of evidence show that current global warming cannot be explained by changes in energy from the Sun:\n1.

In this study, we designed and deployed a robust, sterilizable hardware system for airborne nucleic acid capture featuring active filtration of a quantifiable, controllable volume of air and a high-integrity chamber to protect the sample from loss or contamination. We used our hardware system on an aircraft across multiple height transects over major aerosolization sources to collect air eDNA, coupled with high-throughput amplicon sequencing using multiple DNA metabarcoding markers targeting bacteria, plants, and vertebrates to test the hypothesis of large-scale genetic presence of these bioaerosols throughout the planetary boundary layer in the lower troposphere. Here, we demonstrate that the multi-taxa DNA assemblages inventoried up to 2,500 m using our airplane-mounted hardware system are reflective of major aerosolization sources in the survey area and show previously unreported airborne species detections (i.e., Allium sativum L). We also pioneer an aerial survey flight grid standardized for atmospheric sampling of genetic material and aeroallergens using a light aircraft and limited resources. Our results show that air eDNA from terrestrial bacteria, plants, and vertebrates is detectable up to high altitude using our airborne air sampler and demonstrate the usefulness of light aircraft in monitoring campaigns. However, our work also underscores the need for improved marker choices and reference databases for species in the air column, particularly eukaryotes. Taken together, our findings reveal strong connectivity or mixing of terrestrial-associated eDNA from ground level aerosolization sources and the atmosphere, and we recommend that parameters and indices considering lifting action, atmospheric instability, and potential for convection be incorporated in future surveys for air eDNA. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for light aircraft campaigns to comprehensively and economically inventory bioaerosol emissions and impacts at scale, enabling transformative future opportunities in airborne DNA technology.\nKeywords: Aerial survey, Aeroallergen, Air sampler, Air filtration, Bioaerosol, Biomonitoring, Biodefense, Environmental DNA, Environmental genetics, Metabarcoding, Atmospheric survey\nA rapidly expanding noninvasive technique for monitoring taxa of conservation, health, or agricultural importance is sampling DNA released from organisms into the surrounding environment, such as water and glacier, sediment, precipitation, smoke, or air (Ficetola et al., 2008; Varotto et al., 2021; Palacios Mejia et al., 2021; Ladin et al., 2021; Kobziar et al., 2019; Serrao et al., 2021). Air carries nucleic acid-based particulate matter (bioaerosols). Bacteria and viruses, plant parts including pollen and seeds, fungal spores, invertebrates, vertebrates, and extra-organismal fragments of cells, tissue, feces, or other excretions\u2014all with detectable signatures from their genetic composition\u2014move through the atmosphere. Accordingly, the ability to survey the airborne metagenome representing all taxa, as well as targeted detection within this background, would offer wide applications for pest, infectious agent, and aeroallergen detection, wildlife, ecosystem and climate monitoring, industrial hygiene assessment, and bioprospecting of culturable organisms for agricultural improvement or bioremediation (Bohmann et al., 2014; Tanaka et al., 2019).\nAerobiology is an established research discipline focused on aerosolized bacteria as well as pollen and fungi as aeroallergens or pathogens (e.g., S\u00e1nchez-Parra et al., 2021; Rowney et al., 2021; Banchi et al., 2020a; Kraaijeveld et al., 2015; Longhi et al., 2009; Abrego et al., 2018; Tordoni et al., 2021) including crop pathogen monitoring (reviewed in Mahaffee & Stoll (2016)). Important biological associations on Earth\u2019s surface may be maintained in the air. For example, bacteria and their endotoxins can be co-transported with pollen or fungi in air currents and exacerbate the immune response (Oteros et al., 2019), suggesting co-dispersal is an important ecological phenomenon in the aerobiome (Morris et al., 2007). When used as untreated fertilizer, livestock manure can be a source of infection and zoonosis, containing bacteria, protozoa, and viruses responsible for human or animal disease outbreaks (Polley et al., 2022). Bioaerosol emissions from wastewater treatment plants (Pascual et al., 2003) and within hospitals (Pertegal et al., 2023) can contain airborne pathogens. Scientists have used airborne bacteria as indicators for surface emissions of aerosolized human wastewater and cow manure (Bowers et al., 2013). Animal waste and particulate matter themselves are aeroallergens which can induce immune response (Zahradnik & Raulf, 2017). Yet no aerobiome studies have investigated the association of rural-agroecosystems and suburban areas using metabarcoding to identify key sources (livestock/poultry and plants) in conjunction with bacterial taxa, and little is known about connectivity among air eDNA assemblages.

Kort \u2013 Home for Kort Research Group\n\nGoogle Search Snippet:\nIn the Kort group, our research is focused on understanding atmospheric composition and how it dynamically changes in response to human and natural forces.\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nAir is a medium for dispersal of environmental DNA (eDNA) carried in bioaerosols, yet the atmosphere is mostly unexplored as a source of genetic material encompassing all domains of life. In this study, we designed and deployed a robust, sterilizable hardware system for airborne nucleic acid capture featuring active filtration of a quantifiable, controllable volume of air and a high-integrity chamber to protect the sample from loss or contamination. We used our hardware system on an aircraft across multiple height transects over major aerosolization sources to collect air eDNA, coupled with high-throughput amplicon sequencing using multiple DNA metabarcoding markers targeting bacteria, plants, and vertebrates to test the hypothesis of large-scale genetic presence of these bioaerosols throughout the planetary boundary layer in the lower troposphere. Here, we demonstrate that the multi-taxa DNA assemblages inventoried up to 2,500 m using our airplane-mounted hardware system are reflective of major aerosolization sources in the survey area and show previously unreported airborne species detections (i.e., Allium sativum L). We also pioneer an aerial survey flight grid standardized for atmospheric sampling of genetic material and aeroallergens using a light aircraft and limited resources. Our results show that air eDNA from terrestrial bacteria, plants, and vertebrates is detectable up to high altitude using our airborne air sampler and demonstrate the usefulness of light aircraft in monitoring campaigns. However, our work also underscores the need for improved marker choices and reference databases for species in the air column, particularly eukaryotes. Taken together, our findings reveal strong connectivity or mixing of terrestrial-associated eDNA from ground level aerosolization sources and the atmosphere, and we recommend that parameters and indices considering lifting action, atmospheric instability, and potential for convection be incorporated in future surveys for air eDNA. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for light aircraft campaigns to comprehensively and economically inventory bioaerosol emissions and impacts at scale, enabling transformative future opportunities in airborne DNA technology.\nKeywords: Aerial survey, Aeroallergen, Air sampler, Air filtration, Bioaerosol, Biomonitoring, Biodefense, Environmental DNA, Environmental genetics, Metabarcoding, Atmospheric survey\nA rapidly expanding noninvasive technique for monitoring taxa of conservation, health, or agricultural importance is sampling DNA released from organisms into the surrounding environment, such as water and glacier, sediment, precipitation, smoke, or air (Ficetola et al., 2008; Varotto et al., 2021; Palacios Mejia et al., 2021; Ladin et al., 2021; Kobziar et al., 2019; Serrao et al., 2021). Air carries nucleic acid-based particulate matter (bioaerosols). Bacteria and viruses, plant parts including pollen and seeds, fungal spores, invertebrates, vertebrates, and extra-organismal fragments of cells, tissue, feces, or other excretions\u2014all with detectable signatures from their genetic composition\u2014move through the atmosphere. Accordingly, the ability to survey the airborne metagenome representing all taxa, as well as targeted detection within this background, would offer wide applications for pest, infectious agent, and aeroallergen detection, wildlife, ecosystem and climate monitoring, industrial hygiene assessment, and bioprospecting of culturable organisms for agricultural improvement or bioremediation (Bohmann et al., 2014; Tanaka et al., 2019).\nAerobiology is an established research discipline focused on aerosolized bacteria as well as pollen and fungi as aeroallergens or pathogens (e.g., S\u00e1nchez-Parra et al., 2021; Rowney et al., 2021; Banchi et al., 2020a; Kraaijeveld et al., 2015; Longhi et al., 2009; Abrego et al., 2018; Tordoni et al., 2021) including crop pathogen monitoring (reviewed in Mahaffee & Stoll (2016)). Important biological associations on Earth\u2019s surface may be maintained in the air. For example, bacteria and their endotoxins can be co-transported with pollen or fungi in air currents and exacerbate the immune response (Oteros et al., 2019), suggesting co-dispersal is an important ecological phenomenon in the aerobiome (Morris et al., 2007). When used as untreated fertilizer, livestock manure can be a source of infection and zoonosis, containing bacteria, protozoa, and viruses responsible for human or animal disease outbreaks (Polley et al., 2022). Bioaerosol emissions from wastewater treatment plants (Pascual et al., 2003) and within hospitals (Pertegal et al., 2023) can contain airborne pathogens. Scientists have used airborne bacteria as indicators for surface emissions of aerosolized human wastewater and cow manure (Bowers et al., 2013). Animal waste and particulate matter themselves are aeroallergens which can induce immune response (Zahradnik & Raulf, 2017). Yet no aerobiome studies have investigated the association of rural-agroecosystems and suburban areas using metabarcoding to identify key sources (livestock/poultry and plants) in conjunction with bacterial taxa, and little is known about connectivity among air eDNA assemblages. Such advances in comprehensive biomonitoring would enable us to mitigate aeroallergen impacts on human health (Rowney et al., 2021) and better understand Earth\u2019s aerobiome.\nDespite the fundamental role of air at both local and global scales, the atmosphere is a mostly unexplored medium for environmental nucleic acids (eDNA or eRNA) and the full biodiversity of the aerobiome remains understudied.

Human activity is the principal cause.\n\nFull Page Content:\nThere is unequivocal evidence that Earth is warming at an unprecedented rate. Human activity is the principal cause.\nEarth's climate has changed throughout history. Just in the last 800,000 years, there have been eight cycles of ice ages and warmer periods, with the end of the last ice age about 11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era \u2014 and of human civilization. Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth\u2019s orbit that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives.\nThe current warming trend is different because it is clearly the result of human activities since the mid-1800s, and is proceeding at a rate not seen over many recent millennia.1 It is undeniable that human activities have produced the atmospheric gases that have trapped more of the Sun\u2019s energy in the Earth system. This extra energy has warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land, and widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred.\nEarth-orbiting satellites and new technologies have helped scientists see the big picture, collecting many different types of information about our planet and its climate all over the world. These data, collected over many years, reveal the signs and patterns of a changing climate.\nScientists demonstrated the heat-trapping nature of carbon dioxide and other gases in the mid-19th century.2 Many of the science instruments NASA uses to study our climate focus on how these gases affect the movement of infrared radiation through the atmosphere. From the measured impacts of increases in these gases, there is no question that increased greenhouse gas levels warm Earth in response.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nIce cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that Earth\u2019s climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly 10 times faster than the average rate of warming after an ice age. Carbon dioxide from human activities is increasing about 250 times faster than it did from natural sources after the last Ice Age.3\nThe planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and other human activities.4 Most of the warming occurred in the past 40 years, with the seven most recent years being the warmest. The years 2016 and 2020 are tied for the warmest year on record.5 Image credit: Ashwin Kumar, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic.\nThe ocean has absorbed much of this increased heat, with the top 100 meters (about 328 feet) of ocean showing warming of 0.67 degrees Fahrenheit (0.33 degrees Celsius) since 1969.6 Earth stores 90% of the extra energy in the ocean. Image credit: Kelsey Roberts/USGS\nThe Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass. Data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment show Greenland lost an average of 279 billion tons of ice per year between 1993 and 2019, while Antarctica lost about 148 billion tons of ice per year.7 Image: The Antarctic Peninsula, Credit: NASA\nGlaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world \u2014 including in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska, and Africa.8 Image: Miles Glacier, Alaska Image credit: NASA\nSatellite observations reveal that the amount of spring snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere has decreased over the past five decades and the snow is melting earlier.9 Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\nGlobal sea level rose about 8 inches (20 centimeters) in the last century.

The main gases responsible for the greenhouse effect include carbon ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nThe greenhouse effect is a process that occurs when certain gases in Earth's atmosphere trap the heat from the sun near the surface. This process keeps Earth\u2019s surface warmer than it would be without it. It is similar to how a glass greenhouse keeps plants warm.\nWatch this video to learn about the greenhouse effect!\nAs you might expect from the name, the greenhouse effect works \u2026 like a greenhouse! A greenhouse is a building with glass walls and a glass roof. Greenhouses are used to grow plants, such as tomatoes and tropical flowers. They are often used in places that are colder than a plant's natural environment.\nA greenhouse stays warm inside, even during the winter. In the daytime, sunlight passes through the glass into the greenhouse. It warms the soil, plants, and air inside. At night, the soil and plants slowly release this heat. But the glass traps it in, making the greenhouse warmer than it is outside.\nThe greenhouse effect on Earth works much the same way. Certain gases in the atmosphere trap heat like the glass of a greenhouse. These heat-trapping gases are called greenhouse gases.\nDuring the day, sunlight travels through the atmosphere and warms Earth\u2019s surface. Some of that sunlight bounces, or reflects, off the surface back into space. The rest of it gets absorbed and heats up the surface. At night, Earth's surface cools, releasing this heat back into the air. But some of the heat is trapped by the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. That's what keeps our Earth warm enough to support life as we know it.\nThe greenhouse effect increases on Earth when greenhouse gases are added to the atmosphere. They can be added to the air by a variety of sources.\nScientists have found that over the last 100 years extra greenhouse gases have mainly come from a few sources. These are things like burning coal and oil for energy or burning gasoline to run cars and planes. Other sources, such as erupting volcanoes, have also added some greenhouse gases to the air. But those natural additions have been too small to account for the amount of greenhouse gases we measure in the air today.\nTo reduce the greenhouse effect, greenhouse gases need to be taken out of the atmosphere. Earth has a few ways it does this with plants, soil, and oceans.\nAll plants \u2014 from tall trees to blades of grass, and even the tiny plant-like phytoplankton in the ocean \u2014 take in carbon dioxide and give off oxygen. They do this in a process known as photosynthesis. This is when plants take carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight and change it into food (sugar) and oxygen.\nThe soil and ocean also absorb carbon dioxide from the air. It changes into other things over time through chemical reactions. It can also make the soil and ocean more acidic, which can impact plants and animals. For example, ocean acidification can be harmful to many ocean creatures, such as shellfish and coral, as it weakens their shells and skeletons.\nThe Clouds and the Earth\u2019s Radiant Energy System (CERES) instruments measure changes in the greenhouse effect. They collect data to show how much heat is getting trapped on Earth compared to how much is escaping to space. This data has shown that more heat is getting trapped than what is leaving, which is warming the planet.\nNASA also tracks changes in greenhouse gases over time with satellites. The Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2, or OCO-2, and OCO-3 keep track of carbon dioxide in the air. The Earth Source Mineral Dust Source Investigation, or EMIT, satellite can track methane. Other satellites, like the Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem, or PACE, measure changes in the ocean.\nAqua\u2019s main goal is to improve our understanding of Earth's water cycle.\nOCO-2 is the first spacecraft dedicated to studying carbon dioxide in Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\nOCO-3 is a near replica of OCO-2 and measures carbon dioxide in our atmosphere to help us understand the relationship between plants and carbon dioxide.\nThis mission studies phytoplankton (a type of tiny algae), ocean color and measures atmospheric particles and clouds.\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Bacteria and viruses, plant parts including pollen and seeds, fungal spores, invertebrates, vertebrates, and extra-organismal fragments of cells, tissue, feces, or other excretions\u2014all with detectable signatures from their genetic composition\u2014move through the atmosphere. Accordingly, the ability to survey the airborne metagenome representing all taxa, as well as targeted detection within this background, would offer wide applications for pest, infectious agent, and aeroallergen detection, wildlife, ecosystem and climate monitoring, industrial hygiene assessment, and bioprospecting of culturable organisms for agricultural improvement or bioremediation (Bohmann et al., 2014; Tanaka et al., 2019).\nAerobiology is an established research discipline focused on aerosolized bacteria as well as pollen and fungi as aeroallergens or pathogens (e.g., S\u00e1nchez-Parra et al., 2021; Rowney et al., 2021; Banchi et al., 2020a; Kraaijeveld et al., 2015; Longhi et al., 2009; Abrego et al., 2018; Tordoni et al., 2021) including crop pathogen monitoring (reviewed in Mahaffee & Stoll (2016)). Important biological associations on Earth\u2019s surface may be maintained in the air. For example, bacteria and their endotoxins can be co-transported with pollen or fungi in air currents and exacerbate the immune response (Oteros et al., 2019), suggesting co-dispersal is an important ecological phenomenon in the aerobiome (Morris et al., 2007). When used as untreated fertilizer, livestock manure can be a source of infection and zoonosis, containing bacteria, protozoa, and viruses responsible for human or animal disease outbreaks (Polley et al., 2022). Bioaerosol emissions from wastewater treatment plants (Pascual et al., 2003) and within hospitals (Pertegal et al., 2023) can contain airborne pathogens. Scientists have used airborne bacteria as indicators for surface emissions of aerosolized human wastewater and cow manure (Bowers et al., 2013). Animal waste and particulate matter themselves are aeroallergens which can induce immune response (Zahradnik & Raulf, 2017). Yet no aerobiome studies have investigated the association of rural-agroecosystems and suburban areas using metabarcoding to identify key sources (livestock/poultry and plants) in conjunction with bacterial taxa, and little is known about connectivity among air eDNA assemblages. Such advances in comprehensive biomonitoring would enable us to mitigate aeroallergen impacts on human health (Rowney et al., 2021) and better understand Earth\u2019s aerobiome.\nDespite the fundamental role of air at both local and global scales, the atmosphere is a mostly unexplored medium for environmental nucleic acids (eDNA or eRNA) and the full biodiversity of the aerobiome remains understudied. Recently a few groups have used air for environmental sampling of animal DNA in captive housing enclosures and zoos (Clare et al., 2021, 2022; Lynggaard et al., 2022; Serrao et al., 2021). These proof-of-concept studies demonstrated that it is possible to collect and sequence airborne DNA from animals in artificia\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Air is a mixture of gases, most of which are naturally occurring. Air also contains a significant amount of human-made air pollutants, including some that are not safe to breathe and some that are causing the climate to warm. The troposphere also contains water in all three phases (liquid, solid, and gas) as well as solid particles called aerosols.\nThe dry composition of the atmosphere is mostly nitrogen and oxygen. It also contains fractional amounts of argon and carbon dioxide and trace amounts of other gases, such as helium, neon, methane, krypton, and hydrogen (NASA).\nUCAR\nThe most abundant naturally occurring gas is nitrogen (N2), which makes up about 78% of air. Oxygen (O2) is the second most abundant gas at about 21%. The inert gas argon (Ar) is the third most abundant gas at 0.93%. There are also trace amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2), neon (Ne), helium (He), methane (CH4), krypton (Kr), hydrogen (H2), nitrous oxide (NO), xenon (Xe), ozone (O3), iodine (I2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ammonia (NH3) in the atmosphere.\nDue to the water cycle, the amount of water in the air is constantly changing. The lower troposphere can contain up to 4% water vapor (H2O) in areas near the tropics, while the poles contain only trace amounts of water vapor. The concentration of water vapor decreases drastically with altitude. The upper troposphere has less water vapor than air near the surface, the stratosphere and mesosphere have almost no water vapor, and the thermosphere contains none at all.\nAir also contains tiny solid particles called aerosols, such as dust, sea salt, and ash from erupting volcanoes or forest fires. Many of these particles are so small that they are microscopic. Others are large enough to see. Aerosols affect climate by helping clouds form and shading the planet by scattering or absorbing sunlight. In the last century, manufacturing and widespread use of combustion engines have increased the number of aerosols in the atmosphere as particulate matter spews from smokestacks and exhaust pipes. Burning wood and other materials also add particles to the air.\nLike everything on Earth, the air is made of chemicals. The chemicals in the air often combine with each other, or with other chemicals from the Earth\u2019s surface, through chemical reactions. Many of these chemical reactions help maintain healthy natural environments and are vital for plants and animals. Nitrogen gas in the atmosphere does almost nothing, but nitrogen elsewhere on Earth is essential for life. Through the nitrogen cycle, nitrogen makes its way into soil and water, binds with other elements, and can be used by living things. Oxygen from the atmosphere causes oxidation reactions that help break down matter and release nutrients into soils, and is used by humans and animals in cellular respiration.\nAtmospheric chemistry in the troposphere is also influenced by human-made chemicals that can negatively impact human health and the environment. For example:\nThe table below lists the major gas components and their role in the atmosphere. Click on each molecule name to learn more about them.\nOzone in the troposphere is a human-made pollutant. Ozone in the stratosphere forms the ozone layer, which is crucial for the survival of life at the Earth\u2019s surface.\n\u00a9 2025 UCAR\nThis material is based upon work supported by the NSF National Center for Atmospheric Research, a major facility sponsored by the U.S. National Science Foundation and managed by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research.

It prevents the heat from escaping back into space at night. This ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nThe greenhouse effect is a process that occurs when certain gases in Earth's atmosphere trap the heat from the sun near the surface. This process keeps Earth\u2019s surface warmer than it would be without it. It is similar to how a glass greenhouse keeps plants warm.\nWatch this video to learn about the greenhouse effect!\nAs you might expect from the name, the greenhouse effect works \u2026 like a greenhouse! A greenhouse is a building with glass walls and a glass roof. Greenhouses are used to grow plants, such as tomatoes and tropical flowers. They are often used in places that are colder than a plant's natural environment.\nA greenhouse stays warm inside, even during the winter. In the daytime, sunlight passes through the glass into the greenhouse. It warms the soil, plants, and air inside. At night, the soil and plants slowly release this heat. But the glass traps it in, making the greenhouse warmer than it is outside.\nThe greenhouse effect on Earth works much the same way. Certain gases in the atmosphere trap heat like the glass of a greenhouse. These heat-trapping gases are called greenhouse gases.\nDuring the day, sunlight travels through the atmosphere and warms Earth\u2019s surface. Some of that sunlight bounces, or reflects, off the surface back into space. The rest of it gets absorbed and heats up the surface. At night, Earth's surface cools, releasing this heat back into the air. But some of the heat is trapped by the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. That's what keeps our Earth warm enough to support life as we know it.\nThe greenhouse effect increases on Earth when greenhouse gases are added to the atmosphere. They can be added to the air by a variety of sources.\nScientists have found that over the last 100 years extra greenhouse gases have mainly come from a few sources. These are things like burning coal and oil for energy or burning gasoline to run cars and planes. Other sources, such as erupting volcanoes, have also added some greenhouse gases to the air. But those natural additions have been too small to account for the amount of greenhouse gases we measure in the air today.\nTo reduce the greenhouse effect, greenhouse gases need to be taken out of the atmosphere. Earth has a few ways it does this with plants, soil, and oceans.\nAll plants \u2014 from tall trees to blades of grass, and even the tiny plant-like phytoplankton in the ocean \u2014 take in carbon dioxide and give off oxygen. They do this in a process known as photosynthesis. This is when plants take carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight and change it into food (sugar) and oxygen.\nThe soil and ocean also absorb carbon dioxide from the air. It changes into other things over time through chemical reactions. It can also make the soil and ocean more acidic, which can impact plants and animals. For example, ocean acidification can be harmful to many ocean creatures, such as shellfish and coral, as it weakens their shells and skeletons.\nThe Clouds and the Earth\u2019s Radiant Energy System (CERES) instruments measure changes in the greenhouse effect. They collect data to show how much heat is getting trapped on Earth compared to how much is escaping to space. This data has shown that more heat is getting trapped than what is leaving, which is warming the planet.\nNASA also tracks changes in greenhouse gases over time with satellites. The Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2, or OCO-2, and OCO-3 keep track of carbon dioxide in the air. The Earth Source Mineral Dust Source Investigation, or EMIT, satellite can track methane. Other satellites, like the Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem, or PACE, measure changes in the ocean.\nAqua\u2019s main goal is to improve our understanding of Earth's water cycle.\nOCO-2 is the first spacecraft dedicated to studying carbon dioxide in Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\nOCO-3 is a near replica of OCO-2 and measures carbon dioxide in our atmosphere to help us understand the relationship between plants and carbon dioxide.\nThis mission studies phytoplankton (a type of tiny algae), ocean color and measures atmospheric particles and clouds.\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The troposphere also contains water in all three phases (liquid, solid, and gas) as well as solid particles called aerosols.\nThe dry composition of the atmosphere is mostly nitrogen and oxygen. It also contains fractional amounts of argon and carbon dioxide and trace amounts of other gases, such as helium, neon, methane, krypton, and hydrogen (NASA).\nUCAR\nThe most abundant naturally occurring gas is nitrogen (N2), which makes up about 78% of air. Oxygen (O2) is the second most abundant gas at about 21%. The inert gas argon (Ar) is the third most abundant gas at 0.93%. There are also trace amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2), neon (Ne), helium (He), methane (CH4), krypton (Kr), hydrogen (H2), nitrous oxide (NO), xenon (Xe), ozone (O3), iodine (I2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ammonia (NH3) in the atmosphere.\nDue to the water cycle, the amount of water in the air is constantly changing. The lower troposphere can contain up to 4% water vapor (H2O) in areas near the tropics, while the poles contain only trace amounts of water vapor. The concentration of water vapor decreases drastically with altitude. The upper troposphere has less water vapor than air near the surface, the stratosphere and mesosphere have almost no water vapor, and the thermosphere contains none at all.\nAir also contains tiny solid particles called aerosols, such as dust, sea salt, and ash from erupting volcanoes or forest fires. Many of these particles are so small that they are microscopic. Others are large enough to see. Aerosols affect climate by helping clouds form and shading the planet by scattering or absorbing sunlight.

Global warming, air pollution, ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nThere is unequivocal evidence that Earth is warming at an unprecedented rate. Human activity is the principal cause.\nEarth's climate has changed throughout history. Just in the last 800,000 years, there have been eight cycles of ice ages and warmer periods, with the end of the last ice age about 11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era \u2014 and of human civilization. Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth\u2019s orbit that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives.\nThe current warming trend is different because it is clearly the result of human activities since the mid-1800s, and is proceeding at a rate not seen over many recent millennia.1 It is undeniable that human activities have produced the atmospheric gases that have trapped more of the Sun\u2019s energy in the Earth system. This extra energy has warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land, and widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred.\nEarth-orbiting satellites and new technologies have helped scientists see the big picture, collecting many different types of information about our planet and its climate all over the world. These data, collected over many years, reveal the signs and patterns of a changing climate.\nScientists demonstrated the heat-trapping nature of carbon dioxide and other gases in the mid-19th century.2 Many of the science instruments NASA uses to study our climate focus on how these gases affect the movement of infrared radiation through the atmosphere. From the measured impacts of increases in these gases, there is no question that increased greenhouse gas levels warm Earth in response.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nIce cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that Earth\u2019s climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly 10 times faster than the average rate of warming after an ice age. Carbon dioxide from human activities is increasing about 250 times faster than it did from natural sources after the last Ice Age.3\nThe planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and other human activities.4 Most of the warming occurred in the past 40 years, with the seven most recent years being the warmest. The years 2016 and 2020 are tied for the warmest year on record.5 Image credit: Ashwin Kumar, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic.\nThe ocean has absorbed much of this increased heat, with the top 100 meters (about 328 feet) of ocean showing warming of 0.67 degrees Fahrenheit (0.33 degrees Celsius) since 1969.6 Earth stores 90% of the extra energy in the ocean. Image credit: Kelsey Roberts/USGS\nThe Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass. Data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment show Greenland lost an average of 279 billion tons of ice per year between 1993 and 2019, while Antarctica lost about 148 billion tons of ice per year.7 Image: The Antarctic Peninsula, Credit: NASA\nGlaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world \u2014 including in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska, and Africa.8 Image: Miles Glacier, Alaska Image credit: NASA\nSatellite observations reveal that the amount of spring snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere has decreased over the past five decades and the snow is melting earlier.9 Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\nGlobal sea level rose about 8 inches (20 centimeters) in the last century.

However, human activities over the last century led to unprecedented amounts of GHGs being released into the atmosphere resulting in warming the planet at an alarming rate.\nEarth's climate is changing at a pace that threatens human health, society and the natural environment. These changes include warmer air and ocean temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, retreating snow and ice, increasingly severe weather events, such as hurricanes of greater intensity and sea level rise, among other impacts. Federal agencies are working together to develop a Greenhouse Gas Monitoring and Information System (GHGMIS) for the U.S. to improve measurement of GHG emissions and sinks and track progress towards meet climate mitigation goals. This system uses these advanced capabilities, including the expanded use of GHG observational data and models, to provide enhanced GHG emissions and uptake data estimates that can be used by decision-makers.\nThe NOAA Annual Greenhouse Gas Index from 1979 to 2021, illustrating the cumulative contributions of different greenhouse gases to global warming.

The accompanying donut chart on the right highlights the relative contributions of these gases to global warming, emphasizing the dominant role of CO\u2082, followed by CH\u2084, N\u2082O, and other gases.\nGreenhouse gases (GHGs) in the Earth's atmosphere trap heat and slow heat loss into space.

With a more than 50% increase in ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nKey Takeaway: The amount of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere has increased sharply in the past 100 years as measured from the ground and from satellites. Since carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, this increase has warmed the planet.\n430ppm\nJune 2025\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) is an important greenhouse gas. Greenhouse gases trap the heat from sunlight, warming the planet. Without any greenhouse gases, Earth would be too cold to support life. But the more greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere, the warmer the planet becomes.\nCarbon dioxide comes from sources such as the burning of fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, and natural gas), wildfires, and volcanic eruptions. The graph shows atmospheric CO2 levels measured by NOAA at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, since 1958. It's important to note that \u201cparts per million\u201d refers to the number of carbon dioxide molecules per million molecules of dry air. The data shown are the latest available, updated monthly.\nThe second animated graph shows CO2 levels from an Antarctic ice core in combination with the observations from Mauna Loa Observatory. This extends the record back through Earth\u2019s last three glacial cycles. The Antarctic ice core measures CO2 levels trapped in tiny air bubbles from the past that were preserved when the ice formed.\nGround-based and satellite measurements have measured a sharp increase in atmospheric CO2 in recent decades. With a more than 50% increase in CO2 since the start of industrial times in the 18th century, scientific measurements have linked this increase primarily to the burning of coal, oil, and gas. This means that CO2 levels are now 150% the value they were at in 1750 \u2014 this is at least 1.5 times greater than the natural increase observed at the end of the last ice age 20,000 years ago, which happened over thousands of years.\nThe animated map below shows the historical changes in global carbon dioxide over time. Note the colors change as the amount of CO2 rises from 365 parts per million (ppm) in 2002 to over 420 ppm in 2022. These measurements from the AIRS instrument come from the mid-troposphere, the layer of Earth's atmosphere that is 8 to 12 kilometers (about 5 to 7 miles) above the ground.\nA closer look at the carbon dioxide measurements at Mauna Loa shows a series of wiggles in the data. Although total CO2 is increasing each year, there is also a short-term cycle visible within the larger trend.\nThis annual rise and fall of CO2 levels is caused by seasonal cycles in photosynthesis on a global scale. In Northern Hemisphere spring, plants come to life and draw in CO2 to fuel their growth. This begins the process of lowering the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. In northern autumn, plant growth stops or slows down, and the whole process reverses itself. Much of the plant matter decomposes, releasing CO2 back to the atmosphere.\nA similar but less intense pattern repeats in the Southern Hemisphere in opposite seasons. Spring growth starts in September and winter decomposition begins in March, so CO2 records in the Southern Hemisphere show the opposite pattern of that seen in Mauna Loa. However, because there is a lot more land and vegetation in the Northern Hemisphere than the southern, the global yearly cycle more closely aligns with the northern seasons.\nSee the cycle in action in the visualization Watching Earth Breathe: The Seasonal Vegetation Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide.\nThis cycle of plant growth gives the graph of CO2 a sawtooth pattern of ups and downs from year to year. At a larger scale, the upward climb of the trend line over the decades is caused by CO2 emissions, primarily from burning fossil fuels. Thus, the data illustrate both natural factors and human additions of CO2.\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

In this study, we designed and deployed a robust, sterilizable hardware system for airborne nucleic acid capture featuring active filtration of a quantifiable, controllable volume of air and a high-integrity chamber to protect the sample from loss or contamination. We used our hardware system on an aircraft across multiple height transects over major aerosolization sources to collect air eDNA, coupled with high-throughput amplicon sequencing using multiple DNA metabarcoding markers targeting bacteria, plants, and vertebrates to test the hypothesis of large-scale genetic presence of these bioaerosols throughout the planetary boundary layer in the lower troposphere. Here, we demonstrate that the multi-taxa DNA assemblages inventoried up to 2,500 m using our airplane-mounted hardware system are reflective of major aerosolization sources in the survey area and show previously unreported airborne species detections (i.e., Allium sativum L). We also pioneer an aerial survey flight grid standardized for atmospheric sampling of genetic material and aeroallergens using a light aircraft and limited resources. Our results show that air eDNA from terrestrial bacteria, plants, and vertebrates is detectable up to high altitude using our airborne air sampler and demonstrate the usefulness of light aircraft in monitoring campaigns. However, our work also underscores the need for improved marker choices and reference databases for species in the air column, particularly eukaryotes. Taken together, our findings reveal strong connectivity or mixing of terrestrial-associated eDNA from ground level aerosolization sources and the atmosphere, and we recommend that parameters and indices considering lifting action, atmospheric instability, and potential for convection be incorporated in future surveys for air eDNA. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for light aircraft campaigns to comprehensively and economically inventory bioaerosol emissions and impacts at scale, enabling transformative future opportunities in airborne DNA technology.\nKeywords: Aerial survey, Aeroallergen, Air sampler, Air filtration, Bioaerosol, Biomonitoring, Biodefense, Environmental DNA, Environmental genetics, Metabarcoding, Atmospheric survey\nA rapidly expanding noninvasive technique for monitoring taxa of conservation, health, or agricultural importance is sampling DNA released from organisms into the surrounding environment, such as water and glacier, sediment, precipitation, smoke, or air (Ficetola et al., 2008; Varotto et al., 2021; Palacios Mejia et al., 2021; Ladin et al., 2021; Kobziar et al., 2019; Serrao et al., 2021). Air carries nucleic acid-based particulate matter (bioaerosols). Bacteria and viruses, plant parts including pollen and seeds, fungal spores, invertebrates, vertebrates, and extra-organismal fragments of cells, tissue, feces, or other excretions\u2014all with detectable signatures from their genetic composition\u2014move through the atmosphere. Accordingly, the ability to survey the airborne metagenome representing all taxa, as well as targeted detection within this background, would offer wide applications for pest, infectious agent, and aeroallergen detection, wildlife, ecosystem and climate monitoring, industrial hygiene assessment, and bioprospecting of culturable organisms for agricultural improvement or bioremediation (Bohmann et al., 2014; Tanaka et al., 2019).\nAerobiology is an established research discipline focused on aerosolized bacteria as well as pollen and fungi as aeroallergens or pathogens (e.g., S\u00e1nchez-Parra et al., 2021; Rowney et al., 2021; Banchi et al., 2020a; Kraaijeveld et al., 2015; Longhi et al., 2009; Abrego et al., 2018; Tordoni et al., 2021) including crop pathogen monitoring (reviewed in Mahaffee & Stoll (2016)). Important biological associations on Earth\u2019s surface may be maintained in the air. For example, bacteria and their endotoxins can be co-transported with pollen or fungi in air currents and exacerbate the immune response (Oteros et al., 2019), suggesting co-dispersal is an important ecological phenomenon in the aerobiome (Morris et al., 2007). When used as untreated fertilizer, livestock manure can be a source of infection and zoonosis, containing bacteria, protozoa, and viruses responsible for human or animal disease outbreaks (Polley et al., 2022). Bioaerosol emissions from wastewater treatment plants (Pascual et al., 2003) and within hospitals (Pertegal et al., 2023) can contain airborne pathogens. Scientists have used airborne bacteria as indicators for surface emissions of aerosolized human wastewater and cow manure (Bowers et al., 2013). Animal waste and particulate matter themselves are aeroallergens which can induce immune response (Zahradnik & Raulf, 2017). Yet no aerobiome studies have investigated the association of rural-agroecosystems and suburban areas using metabarcoding to identify key sources (livestock/poultry and plants) in conjunction with bacterial taxa, and little is known about connectivity among air eDNA assemblages. Such advances in comprehensive biomonitoring would enable us to mitigate aeroallergen impacts on human health (Rowney et al., 2021) and better understand Earth\u2019s aerobiome.\nDespite the fundamental role of air at both local and global scales, the atmosphere is a mostly unexplored medium for environmental nucleic acids (eDNA or eRNA) and the full biodiversity of the aerobiome remains understudied. Recently a few groups have used air for environmental sampling of animal DNA in captive housing enclosures and zoos (Clare et al., 2021, 2022; Lynggaard et al., 2022; Serrao et al., 2021). These proof-of-concept studies demonstrated that it is possible to collect and sequence airborne DNA from animals in artificia\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This process keeps Earth\u2019s surface warmer than it would be without it. It is similar to how a glass greenhouse keeps plants warm.\nWatch this video to learn about the greenhouse effect!\nAs you might expect from the name, the greenhouse effect works \u2026 like a greenhouse! A greenhouse is a building with glass walls and a glass roof. Greenhouses are used to grow plants, such as tomatoes and tropical flowers. They are often used in places that are colder than a plant's natural environment.\nA greenhouse stays warm inside, even during the winter. In the daytime, sunlight passes through the glass into the greenhouse. It warms the soil, plants, and air inside. At night, the soil and plants slowly release this heat. But the glass traps it in, making the greenhouse warmer than it is outside.\nThe greenhouse effect on Earth works much the same way. Certain gases in the atmosphere trap heat like the glass of a greenhouse. These heat-trapping gases are called greenhouse gases.\nDuring the day, sunlight travels through the atmosphere and warms Earth\u2019s surface. Some of that sunlight bounces, or reflects, off the surface back into space. The rest of it gets absorbed and heats up the surface. At night, Earth's surface cools, releasing this heat back into the air. But some of the heat is trapped by the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. That's what keeps our Earth warm enough to support life as we know it.\nThe greenhouse effect increases on Earth when greenhouse gases are added to the atmosphere. They can be added to the air by a variety of sources.\nScientists have found that over the last 100 years extra greenhouse gases have mainly come from a few sources. These are things like burning coal and oil for energy or burning gasoline to run cars and planes. Other sources, such as erupting volcanoes, have also added some greenhouse gases to the air. But those natural additions have been too small to account for the amount of greenhouse gases we measure in the air today.\nTo reduce the greenhouse effect, greenhouse gases need to be taken out of the atmosphere. Earth has a few ways it does this with plants, soil, and oceans.\nAll plants \u2014 from tall trees to blades of grass, and even the tiny plant-like phytoplankton in the ocean \u2014 take in carbon dioxide and give off oxygen. They do this in a process known as photosynthesis. This is when plants take carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight and change it into food (sugar) and oxygen.\nThe soil and ocean also absorb carbon dioxide from the air. It changes into other things over time through chemical reactions. It can also make the soil and ocean more acidic, which can impact plants and animals. For example, ocean acidification can be harmful to many ocean creatures, such as shellfish and coral, as it weakens their shells and skeletons.\nThe Clouds and the Earth\u2019s Radiant Energy System (CERES) instruments measure changes in the greenhouse effect. They collect data to show how much heat is getting trapped on Earth compared to how much is escaping to space. This data has shown that more heat is getting trapped than what is leaving, which is warming the planet.\nNASA also tracks changes in greenhouse gases over time with satellites. The Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2, or OCO-2, and OCO-3 keep track of carbon dioxide in the air. The Earth Source Mineral Dust Source Investigation, or EMIT, satellite can track methane. Other satellites, like the Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem, or PACE, measure changes in the ocean.\nAqua\u2019s main goal is to improve our understanding of Earth's water cycle.\nOCO-2 is the first spacecraft dedicated to studying carbon dioxide in Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\nOCO-3 is a near replica of OCO-2 and measures carbon dioxide in our atmosphere to help us understand the relationship between plants and carbon dioxide.\nThis mission studies phytoplankton (a type of tiny algae), ocean color and measures atmospheric particles and clouds.\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Initially it measured major chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and the stratospheric transport tracers nitrous oxide (N2O) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), using gas chromatography with electron capture detection. Compact commercial absorption spectrometers for ozone (O3) and water vapor (H2O) were added to enhance its capabilities on platforms with relatively small payloads. UCATS has since been reconfigured to measure methane (CH4), carbon monoxide (CO), and molecular hydrogen (H2) instead of CFCs and has undergone numerous upgrades to its subsystems. It has served as part of large payloads on stratospheric UAS missions to probe the tropical tropopause region and transport of air into the stratosphere; in piloted aircraft studies of greenhouse gases, transport, and chemistry in the troposphere; and in 2021 is scheduled to return to the study of stratospheric ozone and halogen compounds, one of its original goals. Each deployment brought different challenges, which were largely met or resolved. The design, capabilities, modifications, and some results from UCATS are shown and described here, including changes for future missions.\nAccurate and precise measurements of trace gases and other atmospheric parameters have resulted in an ever more detailed understanding of the chemistry and physics of Earth's atmosphere. This has allowed progress on environmental issues of global concern, including stratospheric ozone depletion and air pollution in the lower atmosphere. For example, after the first report of the Antarctic \u201cozone hole\u201d (Farman et al., 1985), a combination of measurements from balloons, aircraft, and satellites, backed by a wide range of laboratory, theoretical, and modeling studies, allowed a sufficient grasp of the problem to develop an effective international response relatively quickly (Douglass et al., 2014). Though ozone loss and organic halogen emissions are still ongoing matters of concern, climate change driven by greenhouse gas emissions is now the overarching environmental problem today, while air quality continues to be an important issue as well.\nThe Halocarbons and other Atmospheric Trace Species (HATS) group in what is now the Global Monitoring Laboratory (GML) at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Boulder, CO, has long been involved in measuring N2O, CFCs, and other trace gases, primarily by using gas chromatography (GC) with electron capture detectors (ECDs). This led to participation in a series of airborne missions to study halogen budgets, ozone loss, and stratospheric transport, starting on the NASA ER-2 aircraft in 1991 (Elkins et al., 1996). GCs are well suited to measuring multiple trace species in the atmosphere, because with an appropriate column, several compounds can be separated and detected with the same instrument. ECDs are extremely sensitive (a few parts per trillion (ppt) or better) to halogen-containing compounds, including ozone-depleting substances (ODS), and with appropriate modifications can be used to detect other molecules as well. A few other GC instruments have been used for in situ measurements of CFCs (Tyson et al., 1978; Kuster et al., 1981; Vedder et al., 1983; Bujok et al., 2001), and they can now be coupled with mass spectrometric detection (e.g., Apel et al., 2015) as well. With the advent of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), the potential emerged to extend scientific airborne missions to longer durations and other experiments that were not possible with manned aircraft, as well as eliminate some of the danger of flying piloted aircraft in remote regions. Accordingly, the UAS Chromatograph for Atmospheric Trace Species (UCATS), a smaller and lighter-weight version of previous aircraft instruments, was designed and built to measure ODS and other trace gases on UAS missions. These began in 2005 with the Altair UAS, a high-altitude version of the General Atomics Predator B. Given the limited payload capacity of Altair, small and lightweight ozone and water vapor sensors were installed inside UCATS to generate a more complete data set. After two missions on Altair, UCATS joined the payload of the National Science Foundation/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NSF/NCAR) piloted Gulfstream V (GV) for the START-08 (Stratosphere-Troposphere Analyses of Regional Transport 2008) and HIPPO (HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations; 2009\u20132011) missions (Pan et al., 2010; Wofsy, 2011), which included measurements from near the surface to the lower stratosphere. In 2010, UCATS flew on the NASA Global Hawk UAS for the Global Hawk Pacific (GloPac) demonstration project and participated in the Airborne Tropical Tropopause Experiment (ATTREX; Jensen et al., 2013) from 2011 to 2014, to study dehydration, transport, and ozone chemistry in the tropical tropopause layer (TTL). Most recently, UCATS completed the Atmospheric Tomography Mission (ATom; 2016\u20132018), for which the NASA DC-8 aircraft sampled the remote atmosphere over the Atlantic, Pacific, and Southern oceans and parts of the Arctic and Antarctic from near the surface to above 12 km in different seasons. Many of these missions required changes to UCATS, and components were also upgraded when possible. The end result is a compact instrument for UAS and piloted aircraft, capable of measurements of atmospheric composition, chemistry, and transport in the stratosphere and troposphere. We describe the design and components of UCATS in Sect. 2, focusing on ATom, the most recent mission for UCATS; improvements and modifications over the course of its missions in Sect. 3; and data and intercomparisons from some of the field campaigns in Sect. 4, with a short summary including future plans in Sect. 5.\nAt its core, UCATS is similar to previous gas chromatograph (\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Large gas plumes can even be measured by instruments mounted on satellites orbiting the earth.\nOne method for sampling volcanic gases is to collect them directly from fumaroles in evacuated flasks or solution-filled bottles, and then to analyze the mixtures in the laboratory. This type of \"direct sampling\" of gases escaping from fumaroles is currently the only way to (1) fully characterize the composition of gases discharging from volcanoes; and (2) collect isotope data needed to determine the origin of specific gases.\nDirect sampling via soil-efflux surveys can be made in areas where carbon dioxide rises from depth and diffusely discharges into the atmosphere. Dozens of measurements are typically needed to map areas of high gas concentration. One site where soil-efflux measurements have recently been made is near Horseshoe Lake at the base of Mammoth Mountain volcano in California. Here, a large area of trees has been killed by carbon dioxide emissions near the northern shore of the lake.\nMultiGAS instruments can also be used for direct sampling and efficiently monitor several gases at once. Using a combination of optical and electrochemical sensors, these instrument packages can measure the concentrations of CO2, SO2 and H2S as well as environmental parameters like temperature and pressure. They are typically carried to fumaroles or degassing vents during measurement campaigns or even installed permanently at locations downwind of such vents. Instead of collecting gases for later analysis, the collected data can be transmitted by radio to a volcano observatory providing a minute-by-minute record of changes in gas concentration.\nDirect gas sampling can measure the relative amount of gases (concentration), but it does not provide information about the emission rates\u2013this is where remote sensing techniques excel. A COSPEC or DOAS spectrometer measures the amount of sulfur dioxide in a plume cross-section by transecting beneath a plume or scanning across it. Multiplication with the wind speed gives the SO2 emission rate \u2013 the amount of SO22 emitted into the atmosphere every second, hour or day. DOAS instruments attached to satellites can be used to detect very large SO2 plumes.\nDue to the natural background concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, remote-sensing techniques cannot easily detect volcanic CO2.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Instead of collecting gases for later analysis, the collected data can be transmitted by radio to a volcano observatory providing a minute-by-minute record of changes in gas concentration.\nDirect gas sampling can measure the relative amount of gases (concentration), but it does not provide information about the emission rates\u2013this is where remote sensing techniques excel. A COSPEC or DOAS spectrometer measures the amount of sulfur dioxide in a plume cross-section by transecting beneath a plume or scanning across it. Multiplication with the wind speed gives the SO2 emission rate \u2013 the amount of SO22 emitted into the atmosphere every second, hour or day. DOAS instruments attached to satellites can be used to detect very large SO2 plumes.\nDue to the natural background concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, remote-sensing techniques cannot easily detect volcanic CO2.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Air is a mixture of gases, most of which are naturally occurring. Air also contains a significant amount of human-made air pollutants, including some that are not safe to breathe and some that are causing the climate to warm. The troposphere also contains water in all three phases (liquid, solid, and gas) as well as solid particles called aerosols.\nThe dry composition of the atmosphere is mostly nitrogen and oxygen. It also contains fractional amounts of argon and carbon dioxide and trace amounts of other gases, such as helium, neon, methane, krypton, and hydrogen (NASA).\nUCAR\nThe most abundant naturally occurring gas is nitrogen (N2), which makes up about 78% of air. Oxygen (O2) is the second most abundant gas at about 21%. The inert gas argon (Ar) is the third most abundant gas at 0.93%. There are also trace amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2), neon (Ne), helium (He), methane (CH4), krypton (Kr), hydrogen (H2), nitrous oxide (NO), xenon (Xe), ozone (O3), iodine (I2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ammonia (NH3) in the atmosphere.\nDue to the water cycle, the amount of water in the air is constantly changing. The lower troposphere can contain up to 4% water vapor (H2O) in areas near the tropics, while the poles contain only trace amounts of water vapor. The concentration of water vapor decreases drastically with altitude. The upper troposphere has less water vapor than air near the surface, the stratosphere and mesosphere have almost no water vapor, and the thermosphere contains none at all.\nAir also contains tiny solid particles called aerosols, such as dust, sea salt, and ash from erupting volcanoes or forest fires. Many of these particles are so small that they are microscopic. Others are large enough to see. Aerosols affect climate by helping clouds form and shading the planet by scattering or absorbing sunlight. In the last century, manufacturing and widespread use of combustion engines have increased the number of aerosols in the atmosphere as particulate matter spews from smokestacks and exhaust pipes. Burning wood and other materials also add particles to the air.\nLike everything on Earth, the air is made of chemicals. The chemicals in the air often combine with each other, or with other chemicals from the Earth\u2019s surface, through chemical reactions. Many of these chemical reactions help maintain healthy natural environments and are vital for plants and animals. Nitrogen gas in the atmosphere does almost nothing, but nitrogen elsewhere on Earth is essential for life. Through the nitrogen cycle, nitrogen makes its way into soil and water, binds with other elements, and can be used by living things. Oxygen from the atmosphere causes oxidation reactions that help break down matter and release nutrients into soils, and is used by humans and animals in cellular respiration.\nAtmospheric chemistry in the troposphere is also influenced by human-made chemicals that can negatively impact human health and the environment. For example:\nThe table below lists the major gas components and their role in the atmosphere. Click on each molecule name to learn more about them.\nOzone in the troposphere is a human-made pollutant. Ozone in the stratosphere forms the ozone layer, which is crucial for the survival of life at the Earth\u2019s surface.\n\u00a9 2025 UCAR\nThis material is based upon work supported by the NSF National Center for Atmospheric Research, a major facility sponsored by the U.S. National Science Foundation and managed by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research.

If you\u2019ve ever driven past one, your nose will tell you that those piles of garbage are emitting gas. Landfill gas, which is a biogas\u2014 composed primarily of methane and carbon dioxide\u2014isn\u2019t just stinky, it also contributes to global climate change. Large landfills are required to collect and burn their biogas to reduce the amount of unhealthy fumes they emit. But biogas has more beneficial uses. It can be converted to compressed natural gas or hydrogen, or be used to generate electricity. As more and more cars, trucks, and buses start to operate on these alternative fuels, it seems a waste to send any of our biogas up in smoke. What if we converted all available U.S. garbage fumes from large landfills into transportation fuel?\nSome U.S. landfills are already collecting biogas for use in energy projects2. EPA estimates that there are about 450 landfills with untapped potential to use their garbage fumes. These landfills could collect an approximate total of 475 million cubic feet of biogas per day \u2014 enough to fill nearly a billion party balloons.\nIf we converted all this biogas to transportation fuel, we could prevent about 40 million metric tons of direct GHG emissions (CO2e) from being released each year, equivalent to taking 8 million cars off the road.3\nPlus, because we are displacing gasoline or diesel, we would also reduce lifecycle GHG emissions associated with producing and distributing the fuel used by those vehicles.\nIf your local landfill is large, it may be emitting enough gas to produce up to 3,200 gallons gasoline equivalent (GGE) of transportation fuel each day. (One GGE is the amount of fuel that contains the same energy as one gallon of gasoline.) How many vehicles would this power?\n*The higher number of electric cars (EVs) reflects both that cars consume less fuel per mile than garbage trucks or buses and that EVs today have a limited driving range per battery charge. We assumed a fully charged EV battery would power about 100 miles of driving.\nEven more opportunities will emerge as additional cars, trucks, and buses that use advanced fuels enter the market. So, next time you are driving by a landfill, don\u2019t just think, \u201cEwww!\u201d think, \u201csmells like a refueling opportunity!\u201d\nWhat If Garbage Fumes Powered More of Our Cars, Trucks, and Buses?

Launched in 2002, AIRS is one of six instruments aboard Aqua. At the time of its launch, AIRS was the most advanced atmospheric sounding system ever deployed in space, and it continues to make major contributions to our understanding of climate. During its 17 years in orbit, AIRS data have also improved operational weather forecasts around the world, and the instrument measures atmospheric temperature, water vapor and a number of trace gases, including carbon dioxide, ammonia, methane and carbon monoxide.\nFetzer highlighted a few of AIRS\u2019 many scientific achievements.\n\u201cWe found that Earth\u2019s climate system has responded to increasing carbon dioxide concentrations as climate models predicted,\u201d he said. \u201cAtmospheric water vapor is sensitive to the presence of carbon dioxide. The more carbon dioxide, the more the atmosphere warms due to the greenhouse effect. A warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor, which is itself a greenhouse gas. This is how water vapor triples the warming from increasing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.\u201d\nAIRS data have detected significant changes in the climate of the Arctic. \u201cWe see increases in Arctic water vapor levels,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Arctic atmosphere is becoming more moist, adding to its warming, and the ocean is becoming more ice-free. These changes are happening more rapidly than scientists expected. I didn\u2019t anticipate seeing them in a 17-year data record.\u201d\nFetzer said the AIRS team has also observed significant increases in the concentration of atmospheric ammonia in areas like northern India and eastern China due to agricultural activities. This has negatively impacted air quality in these regions.\nFetzer added that while greenhouse gases are arguably the biggest driver of global climate change, other chemicals such as carbon monoxide and ammonia are also changing significantly, and AIRS is tracking those changes.\nWhile a replacement for AIRS was not specifically called out in the latest National Academy of Sciences\u2019 Earth science decadal survey, which provides a roadmap for future Earth science satellite missions, Fetzer\u2019s team is still planning for such a possibility.\n\u201cMost NASA instruments are typically one-of-a-kind, and there aren\u2019t usually plans for replacements,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the years since AIRS was developed, atmospheric sounding techniques have changed significantly. But while the technologies may be different, the nature of the measurement remains the same.\u201d\nIn fact, says Fetzer, many of the instruments developed in recent years to measure the atmosphere derive heritage from AIRS. For example, techniques developed for use on AIRS have been applied to such missions as the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) instrument on the NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite, NOAA\u2019s Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS)-1 satellite, and the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) instruments on the three polar-orbiting MetOp meteorological satellites developed by the European Space Agency and operated by the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT).\n\u201cEven if an AIRS replacement is never built, AIRS has firmly cemented its place in atmospheric science history,\u201d he said.\nFor more on AIRS, visit https://airs.jpl.nasa.gov/.\nPart Four of this series: 'The Atmosphere: Fresh Insights on Air Quality, Ozone and Climate'\nA potent atmospheric river delivered intense rainfall to western Washington, triggering flooding and mudslides.\nThe right combination of conditions allowed this distinctive low cloud to form in California\u2019s Central\u2026\nThe ozone hole over the Antarctic was small in 2025 compared to previous years and\u2026\nExplore Earth Science\nNASA's unique vantage point helps us inform solutions to enhance decision-making, improve livelihoods, and protect our planet.\nEarth Science Data\nFacts About Earth\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Launched in 2002, AIRS is one of six instruments aboard Aqua. At the time of its launch, AIRS was the most advanced atmospheric sounding system ever deployed in space, and it continues to make major contributions to our understanding of climate. During its 17 years in orbit, AIRS data have also improved operational weather forecasts around the world, and the instrument measures atmospheric temperature, water vapor and a number of trace gases, including carbon dioxide, ammonia, methane and carbon monoxide.\nFetzer highlighted a few of AIRS\u2019 many scientific achievements.\n\u201cWe found that Earth\u2019s climate system has responded to increasing carbon dioxide concentrations as climate models predicted,\u201d he said. \u201cAtmospheric water vapor is sensitive to the presence of carbon dioxide. The more carbon dioxide, the more the atmosphere warms due to the greenhouse effect. A warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor, which is itself a greenhouse gas. This is how water vapor triples the warming from increasing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.\u201d\nAIRS data have detected significant changes in the climate of the Arctic. \u201cWe see increases in Arctic water vapor levels,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Arctic atmosphere is becoming more moist, adding to its warming, and the ocean is becoming more ice-free. These changes are happening more rapidly than scientists expected. I didn\u2019t anticipate seeing them in a 17-year data record.\u201d\nFetzer said the AIRS team has also observed significant increases in the concentration of atmospheric ammonia in areas like northern India and eastern China due to agricultural activities. This has negatively impacted air quality in these regions.\nFetzer added that while greenhouse gases are arguably the biggest driver of global climate change, other chemicals such as carbon monoxide and ammonia are also changing significantly, and AIRS is tracking those changes.\nWhile a replacement for AIRS was not specifically called out in the latest National Academy of Sciences\u2019 Earth science decadal survey, which provides a roadmap for future Earth science satellite missions, Fetzer\u2019s team is still planning for such a possibility.\n\u201cMost NASA instruments are typically one-of-a-kind, and there aren\u2019t usually plans for replacements,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the years since AIRS was developed, atmospheric sounding techniques have changed significantly. But while the technologies may be different, the nature of the measurement remains the same.\u201d\nIn fact, says Fetzer, many of the instruments developed in recent years to measure the atmosphere derive heritage from AIRS. For example, techniques developed for use on AIRS have been applied to such missions as the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) instrument on the NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite, NOAA\u2019s Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS)-1 satellite, and the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) instruments on the three polar-orbiting MetOp meteorological satellites developed by the European Space Agency and operated by the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT).\n\u201cEven if an AIRS replacement is never built, AIRS has firmly cemented its place in atmospheric science history,\u201d he said.\nFor more on AIRS, visit https://airs.jpl.nasa.gov/.\nPart Four of this series: 'The Atmosphere: Fresh Insights on Air Quality, Ozone and Climate'\nA potent atmospheric river delivered intense rainfall to western Washington, triggering flooding and mudslides.\nThe right combination of conditions allowed this distinctive low cloud to form in California\u2019s Central\u2026\nThe ozone hole over the Antarctic was small in 2025 compared to previous years and\u2026\nExplore Earth Science\nNASA's unique vantage point helps us inform solutions to enhance decision-making, improve livelihoods, and protect our planet.\nEarth Science Data\nFacts About Earth\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Air is a mixture of gases, most of which are naturally occurring. Air also contains a significant amount of human-made air pollutants, including some that are not safe to breathe and some that are causing the climate to warm. The troposphere also contains water in all three phases (liquid, solid, and gas) as well as solid particles called aerosols.\nThe dry composition of the atmosphere is mostly nitrogen and oxygen. It also contains fractional amounts of argon and carbon dioxide and trace amounts of other gases, such as helium, neon, methane, krypton, and hydrogen (NASA).\nUCAR\nThe most abundant naturally occurring gas is nitrogen (N2), which makes up about 78% of air. Oxygen (O2) is the second most abundant gas at about 21%. The inert gas argon (Ar) is the third most abundant gas at 0.93%. There are also trace amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2), neon (Ne), helium (He), methane (CH4), krypton (Kr), hydrogen (H2), nitrous oxide (NO), xenon (Xe), ozone (O3), iodine (I2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ammonia (NH3) in the atmosphere.\nDue to the water cycle, the amount of water in the air is constantly changing. The lower troposphere can contain up to 4% water vapor (H2O) in areas near the tropics, while the poles contain only trace amounts of water vapor. The concentration of water vapor decreases drastically with altitude. The upper troposphere has less water vapor than air near the surface, the stratosphere and mesosphere have almost no water vapor, and the thermosphere contains none at all.\nAir also contains tiny solid particles called aerosols, such as dust, sea salt, and ash from erupting volcanoes or forest fires. Many of these particles are so small that they are microscopic. Others are large enough to see. Aerosols affect climate by helping clouds form and shading the planet by scattering or absorbing sunlight. In the last century, manufacturing and widespread use of combustion engines have increased the number of aerosols in the atmosphere as particulate matter spews from smokestacks and exhaust pipes. Burning wood and other materials also add particles to the air.\nLike everything on Earth, the air is made of chemicals. The chemicals in the air often combine with each other, or with other chemicals from the Earth\u2019s surface, through chemical reactions. Many of these chemical reactions help maintain healthy natural environments and are vital for plants and animals. Nitrogen gas in the atmosphere does almost nothing, but nitrogen elsewhere on Earth is essential for life. Through the nitrogen cycle, nitrogen makes its way into soil and water, binds with other elements, and can be used by living things. Oxygen from the atmosphere causes oxidation reactions that help break down matter and release nutrients into soils, and is used by humans and animals in cellular respiration.\nAtmospheric chemistry in the troposphere is also influenced by human-made chemicals that can negatively impact human health and the environment. For example:\nThe table below lists the major gas components and their role in the atmosphere. Click on each molecule name to learn more about them.\nOzone in the troposphere is a human-made pollutant. Ozone in the stratosphere forms the ozone layer, which is crucial for the survival of life at the Earth\u2019s surface.\n\u00a9 2025 UCAR\nThis material is based upon work supported by the NSF National Center for Atmospheric Research, a major facility sponsored by the U.S. National Science Foundation and managed by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research.

Collectively ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nThe greenhouse effect is a process that occurs when certain gases in Earth's atmosphere trap the heat from the sun near the surface. This process keeps Earth\u2019s surface warmer than it would be without it. It is similar to how a glass greenhouse keeps plants warm.\nWatch this video to learn about the greenhouse effect!\nAs you might expect from the name, the greenhouse effect works \u2026 like a greenhouse! A greenhouse is a building with glass walls and a glass roof. Greenhouses are used to grow plants, such as tomatoes and tropical flowers. They are often used in places that are colder than a plant's natural environment.\nA greenhouse stays warm inside, even during the winter. In the daytime, sunlight passes through the glass into the greenhouse. It warms the soil, plants, and air inside. At night, the soil and plants slowly release this heat. But the glass traps it in, making the greenhouse warmer than it is outside.\nThe greenhouse effect on Earth works much the same way. Certain gases in the atmosphere trap heat like the glass of a greenhouse. These heat-trapping gases are called greenhouse gases.\nDuring the day, sunlight travels through the atmosphere and warms Earth\u2019s surface. Some of that sunlight bounces, or reflects, off the surface back into space. The rest of it gets absorbed and heats up the surface. At night, Earth's surface cools, releasing this heat back into the air. But some of the heat is trapped by the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. That's what keeps our Earth warm enough to support life as we know it.\nThe greenhouse effect increases on Earth when greenhouse gases are added to the atmosphere. They can be added to the air by a variety of sources.\nScientists have found that over the last 100 years extra greenhouse gases have mainly come from a few sources. These are things like burning coal and oil for energy or burning gasoline to run cars and planes. Other sources, such as erupting volcanoes, have also added some greenhouse gases to the air. But those natural additions have been too small to account for the amount of greenhouse gases we measure in the air today.\nTo reduce the greenhouse effect, greenhouse gases need to be taken out of the atmosphere. Earth has a few ways it does this with plants, soil, and oceans.\nAll plants \u2014 from tall trees to blades of grass, and even the tiny plant-like phytoplankton in the ocean \u2014 take in carbon dioxide and give off oxygen. They do this in a process known as photosynthesis. This is when plants take carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight and change it into food (sugar) and oxygen.\nThe soil and ocean also absorb carbon dioxide from the air. It changes into other things over time through chemical reactions. It can also make the soil and ocean more acidic, which can impact plants and animals. For example, ocean acidification can be harmful to many ocean creatures, such as shellfish and coral, as it weakens their shells and skeletons.\nThe Clouds and the Earth\u2019s Radiant Energy System (CERES) instruments measure changes in the greenhouse effect. They collect data to show how much heat is getting trapped on Earth compared to how much is escaping to space. This data has shown that more heat is getting trapped than what is leaving, which is warming the planet.\nNASA also tracks changes in greenhouse gases over time with satellites. The Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2, or OCO-2, and OCO-3 keep track of carbon dioxide in the air. The Earth Source Mineral Dust Source Investigation, or EMIT, satellite can track methane. Other satellites, like the Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem, or PACE, measure changes in the ocean.\nAqua\u2019s main goal is to improve our understanding of Earth's water cycle.\nOCO-2 is the first spacecraft dedicated to studying carbon dioxide in Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\nOCO-3 is a near replica of OCO-2 and measures carbon dioxide in our atmosphere to help us understand the relationship between plants and carbon dioxide.\nThis mission studies phytoplankton (a type of tiny algae), ocean color and measures atmospheric particles and clouds.\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Initially it measured major chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and the stratospheric transport tracers nitrous oxide (N2O) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), using gas chromatography with electron capture detection. Compact commercial absorption spectrometers for ozone (O3) and water vapor (H2O) were added to enhance its capabilities on platforms with relatively small payloads. UCATS has since been reconfigured to measure methane (CH4), carbon monoxide (CO), and molecular hydrogen (H2) instead of CFCs and has undergone numerous upgrades to its subsystems. It has served as part of large payloads on stratospheric UAS missions to probe the tropical tropopause region and transport of air into the stratosphere; in piloted aircraft studies of greenhouse gases, transport, and chemistry in the troposphere; and in 2021 is scheduled to return to the study of stratospheric ozone and halogen compounds, one of its original goals. Each deployment brought different challenges, which were largely met or resolved. The design, capabilities, modifications, and some results from UCATS are shown and described here, including changes for future missions.\nAccurate and precise measurements of trace gases and other atmospheric parameters have resulted in an ever more detailed understanding of the chemistry and physics of Earth's atmosphere. This has allowed progress on environmental issues of global concern, including stratospheric ozone depletion and air pollution in the lower atmosphere. For example, after the first report of the Antarctic \u201cozone hole\u201d (Farman et al., 1985), a combination of measurements from balloons, aircraft, and satellites, backed by a wide range of laboratory, theoretical, and modeling studies, allowed a sufficient grasp of the problem to develop an effective international response relatively quickly (Douglass et al., 2014). Though ozone loss and organic halogen emissions are still ongoing matters of concern, climate change driven by greenhouse gas emissions is now the overarching environmental problem today, while air quality continues to be an important issue as well.\nThe Halocarbons and other Atmospheric Trace Species (HATS) group in what is now the Global Monitoring Laboratory (GML) at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Boulder, CO, has long been involved in measuring N2O, CFCs, and other trace gases, primarily by using gas chromatography (GC) with electron capture detectors (ECDs). This led to participation in a series of airborne missions to study halogen budgets, ozone loss, and stratospheric transport, starting on the NASA ER-2 aircraft in 1991 (Elkins et al., 1996). GCs are well suited to measuring multiple trace species in the atmosphere, because with an appropriate column, several compounds can be separated and detected with the same instrument. ECDs are extremely sensitive (a few parts per trillion (ppt) or better) to halogen-containing compounds, including ozone-depleting substances (ODS), and with appropriate modifications can be used to detect other molecules as well. A few other GC instruments have been used for in situ measurements of CFCs (Tyson et al., 1978; Kuster et al., 1981; Vedder et al., 1983; Bujok et al., 2001), and they can now be coupled with mass spectrometric detection (e.g., Apel et al., 2015) as well. With the advent of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), the potential emerged to extend scientific airborne missions to longer durations and other experiments that were not possible with manned aircraft, as well as eliminate some of the danger of flying piloted aircraft in remote regions. Accordingly, the UAS Chromatograph for Atmospheric Trace Species (UCATS), a smaller and lighter-weight version of previous aircraft instruments, was designed and built to measure ODS and other trace gases on UAS missions. These began in 2005 with the Altair UAS, a high-altitude version of the General Atomics Predator B. Given the limited payload capacity of Altair, small and lightweight ozone and water vapor sensors were installed inside UCATS to generate a more complete data set. After two missions on Altair, UCATS joined the payload of the National Science Foundation/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NSF/NCAR) piloted Gulfstream V (GV) for the START-08 (Stratosphere-Troposphere Analyses of Regional Transport 2008) and HIPPO (HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations; 2009\u20132011) missions (Pan et al., 2010; Wofsy, 2011), which included measurements from near the surface to the lower stratosphere. In 2010, UCATS flew on the NASA Global Hawk UAS for the Global Hawk Pacific (GloPac) demonstration project and participated in the Airborne Tropical Tropopause Experiment (ATTREX; Jensen et al., 2013) from 2011 to 2014, to study dehydration, transport, and ozone chemistry in the tropical tropopause layer (TTL). Most recently, UCATS completed the Atmospheric Tomography Mission (ATom; 2016\u20132018), for which the NASA DC-8 aircraft sampled the remote atmosphere over the Atlantic, Pacific, and Southern oceans and parts of the Arctic and Antarctic from near the surface to above 12 km in different seasons. Many of these missions required changes to UCATS, and components were also upgraded when possible. The end result is a compact instrument for UAS and piloted aircraft, capable of measurements of atmospheric composition, chemistry, and transport in the stratosphere and troposphere. We describe the design and components of UCATS in Sect. 2, focusing on ATom, the most recent mission for UCATS; improvements and modifications over the course of its missions in Sect. 3; and data and intercomparisons from some of the field campaigns in Sect. 4, with a short summary including future plans in Sect. 5.\nAt its core, UCATS is similar to previous gas chromatograph (\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

A few other GC instruments have been used for in situ measurements of CFCs (Tyson et al., 1978; Kuster et al., 1981; Vedder et al., 1983; Bujok et al., 2001), and they can now be coupled with mass spectrometric detection (e.g., Apel et al., 2015) as well. With the advent of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), the potential emerged to extend scientific airborne missions to longer durations and other experiments that were not possible with manned aircraft, as well as eliminate some of the danger of flying piloted aircraft in remote regions. Accordingly, the UAS Chromatograph for Atmospheric Trace Species (UCATS), a smaller and lighter-weight version of previous aircraft instruments, was designed and built to measure ODS and other trace gases on UAS missions. These began in 2005 with the Altair UAS, a high-altitude version of the General Atomics Predator B. Given the limited payload capacity of Altair, small and lightweight ozone and water vapor sensors were installed inside UCATS to generate a more complete data set. After two missions on Altair, UCATS joined the payload of the National Science Foundation/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NSF/NCAR) piloted Gulfstream V (GV) for the START-08 (Stratosphere-Troposphere Analyses of Regional Transport 2008) and HIPPO (HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations; 2009\u20132011) missions (Pan et al., 2010; Wofsy, 2011), which included measurements from near the surface to the lower stratosphere. In 2010, UCATS flew on the NASA Global Hawk UAS for the Global Hawk Pacific (GloPac) demonstration project and participated in the Airborne Tropical Tropopause Experiment (ATTREX; Jensen et al., 2013) from 2011 to 2014, to study dehydration, transport, and ozone chemistry in the tropical tropopause layer (TTL). Most recently, UCATS completed the Atmospheric Tomography Mission (ATom; 2016\u20132018), for which the NASA DC-8 aircraft sampled the remote atmosphere over the Atlantic, Pacific, and Southern oceans and parts of the Arctic and Antarctic from near the surface to above 12 km in different seasons. Many of these missions required changes to UCATS, and components were also upgraded when possible. The end result is a compact instrument for UAS and piloted aircraft, capable of measurements of atmospheric composition, chemistry, and transport in the stratosphere and troposphere. We describe the design and components of UCATS in Sect. 2, focusing on ATom, the most recent mission for UCATS; improvements and modifications over the course of its missions in Sect. 3; and data and intercomparisons from some of the field campaigns in Sect. 4, with a short summary including future plans in Sect. 5.\nAt its core, UCATS is similar to previous gas chromatograph (\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

If you\u2019ve ever driven past one, your nose will tell you that those piles of garbage are emitting gas. Landfill gas, which is a biogas\u2014 composed primarily of methane and carbon dioxide\u2014isn\u2019t just stinky, it also contributes to global climate change. Large landfills are required to collect and burn their biogas to reduce the amount of unhealthy fumes they emit. But biogas has more beneficial uses. It can be converted to compressed natural gas or hydrogen, or be used to generate electricity. As more and more cars, trucks, and buses start to operate on these alternative fuels, it seems a waste to send any of our biogas up in smoke. What if we converted all available U.S. garbage fumes from large landfills into transportation fuel?\nSome U.S. landfills are already collecting biogas for use in energy projects2. EPA estimates that there are about 450 landfills with untapped potential to use their garbage fumes. These landfills could collect an approximate total of 475 million cubic feet of biogas per day \u2014 enough to fill nearly a billion party balloons.\nIf we converted all this biogas to transportation fuel, we could prevent about 40 million metric tons of direct GHG emissions (CO2e) from being released each year, equivalent to taking 8 million cars off the road.3\nPlus, because we are displacing gasoline or diesel, we would also reduce lifecycle GHG emissions associated with producing and distributing the fuel used by those vehicles.\nIf your local landfill is large, it may be emitting enough gas to produce up to 3,200 gallons gasoline equivalent (GGE) of transportation fuel each day. (One GGE is the amount of fuel that contains the same energy as one gallon of gasoline.) How many vehicles would this power?\n*The higher number of electric cars (EVs) reflects both that cars consume less fuel per mile than garbage trucks or buses and that EVs today have a limited driving range per battery charge. We assumed a fully charged EV battery would power about 100 miles of driving.\nEven more opportunities will emerge as additional cars, trucks, and buses that use advanced fuels enter the market. So, next time you are driving by a landfill, don\u2019t just think, \u201cEwww!\u201d think, \u201csmells like a refueling opportunity!\u201d\nWhat If Garbage Fumes Powered More of Our Cars, Trucks, and Buses?

Fertilizers, derived from mineral, synthetic, and organic sources, have played a crucial role in modern agriculture by significantly increasing crop yields, thus ensuring essential human nutrition, global food security, crop quantity and quality, and sustainable soil management. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, fertilizer can be a chemical or natural substance or material that is used to provide nutrients to plants, usually via application to the soil, but also to foliage or through water in rice systems, fertigation or hydroponics or aquaculture operations [2]. Their aim is to supply nutrients to plants, thereby increasing soil fertility and crop yields, and to supplement and restore soil nutrients to maintain good soil condition.\nAlthough the use of fertilizers in agriculture has increased over the years, information on their impact on public health and the environment is limited. Fertilizers are an essential tool for soil management, but their use may result in an increase in contamination of soils, air, and water either from the elements of the fertilizers or their contaminants, such as toxic trace elements for inorganic and pathogens for organic fertilizers. Along with the application of inorganic fertilizers, levels of nitrogen compounds in water, air, and soil have doubled over the past 100 years, affecting plants, animals, and humans [3]. Recent projections for fertilizer use indicate an evolving landscape influenced by various market and environmental factors. According to the International Fertilizer Association (IFA), global primary nutrient sales, including nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, are expected to continue growing, albeit at a slower rate. By 2024, the global demand for fertilizers is projected to reach approximately 263 million tonnes, reflecting an average annual growth rate of about 0.9% from 2020 [4].\nThe report of the third session of the United Nations Environmental Assembly highlighted the lack of available data on the impact of fertilizers on both human health and the environment [5]. Conducting epidemiological research on fertilizers presents unique challenges because of their frequent concurrent use with insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides, which complicates the ability to isolate and attribute specific health effects to individual substances. This overlapping usage creates confounding variables that make it difficult to disentangle the distinct impacts of fertilizers from those of other agrochemicals. In this review, we sought to systematically assess the state of the evidence regarding the available epidemiological data on the association between fertilizer use and human health.\nWe searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science up to May 2024 using two distinct and complementary search algorithms: (\u201cfertile*\u201d OR \u201cchemical fertilizer\u201d OR \u201csynthetic fertilizer\u201d OR \u201corganic fertilizer\u201d OR \u201corganic inputs\u201d OR \u201cmineral fertilizer\u201d OR \u201corganic manure\u201d OR \u201cmanure\u201d) (limited to \u201chuman\u201d), complemented by an algorithm capturing the biomedical literature related to the use of sewage sludge as fertilizer, using the terms: ((\u201cwaste\u201d OR \u201csewage sludge\u201d OR \u201cbiosolids\u201d OR \u201camendment\u201d) AND (\u201cfarming\u201d OR \u201ccrop*\u201d OR \u201csoil\u201d)) across all age groups (from newborns to adults).

Everything we eat consists of plants or animals that depend on plants somewhere along the food chain. Plants also form the backbone of natural ecosystems, and they absorb about 30 percent of all the carbon dioxide emitted by humans each year. But as the impacts of climate change worsen, how are higher levels of CO2 in the atmosphere and warmer temperatures affecting the plant world?\nPlants use sunlight, carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and water for photosynthesis to produce oxygen and carbohydrates that plants use for energy and growth.\nRising levels of CO2 in the atmosphere drive an increase in plant photosynthesis\u2014an effect known as the carbon fertilization effect. New research has found that between 1982 and 2020, global plant photosynthesis grew 12 percent, tracking CO2 levels in the atmosphere as they rose 17 percent. The vast majority of this increase in photosynthesis was due to carbon dioxide fertilization.\nIncreased photosynthesis results in more growth in some plants. Scientists have found that in response to elevated CO2 levels, above-ground plant growth increased an average of 21 percent, while below-ground growth increased 28 percent. As a result, some crops such as wheat, rice and soybeans are expected to benefit from increased CO2 with an increase in yields from 12 to 14 percent. The growth of some tropical and sub-tropical grasses and several important crops, including corn, sugar cane, sorghum, and millet, however, are not as affected by increased CO2.\nUnder elevated CO2 concentrations, plants use less water during photosynthesis. Plants have openings called stomata that allow CO2 to be absorbed and moisture to be released into the atmosphere. When CO2 levels rise, plants can maintain a high rate of photosynthesis and partially close their stomata, which can decrease a plant\u2019s water loss between 5 and 20 percent. Scientists have speculated that this could result in plants releasing less water to the atmosphere, thus keeping more on land, in the soil and streams.\nElevated levels of CO2 from climate change may enable plants to benefit from the carbon fertilization effect and use less water to grow, but it\u2019s not all good news for plants. It\u2019s more complicated than that, because climate change is also impacting other factors critical to plants\u2019 growth, such as nutrients, temperature, and water.\nResearchers that studied hundreds of plant species between 1980 and 2017 found that most unfertilized terrestrial ecosystems are becoming deficient in nutrients, particularly nitrogen. They attributed this decrease in nutrients to global changes, including rising temperatures and CO2 levels.\nNitrogen is the most abundant element on Earth, making up about 80 percent of the atmosphere. It is an essential element in DNA and RNA and is needed by plants to make carbohydrates and proteins for growth. However, plants cannot use the nitrogen gas found in the atmosphere because it has two atoms of nitrogen triply bonded together so tightly that they are difficult to break apart into a form plants can use. Lightning has enough energy to break the triple bond, a process called nitrogen fixation. Nitrogen is also fixed in the industrial process that produces fertilizer.\nBut most nitrogen fixation occurs in the soil, where certain kinds of bacteria attach to the roots of plants, such as legumes. The bacteria get carbon from the plant and in a symbiotic exchange, fix the nitrogen, combining it with oxygen or hydrogen into compounds plants can use.\nKevin Griffin, a professor in Columbia University\u2019s Department of Ecology, Evolution and Environmental Biology and the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, explained that most living things have a relatively fixed ratio between carbon and nitrogen. This means that if plants take up more CO2 to create carbohydrates because there\u2019s more CO2 in the atmosphere, the amount of nitrogen in the leaves may be diluted, and a plant\u2019s productivity depends on having enough nitrogen. \u201cIf you increase the CO2 around a leaf or around the plant or around the plot of forest, usually the productivity goes up,\u201d he said. \u201cBut whether or not that increase in productivity lasts and is permanent, can be a function of whether you have [enough] nitrogen. So if nitrogen is limited, it could be that a plant just cannot use that extra CO2 and its boost in productivity can be short lived.\u201d\nTrees currently absorb about a third of human-caused CO2 emissions, but their ability to continue to do this depends on how much nitrogen is available to them. If nitrogen is limited, the benefit of increased CO2 will be limited too.\nEarlier research on nitrogen fixation, based on measurements of free-living bacteria, had predicted that the fixation process works fastest at 25\u00b0C, and that as temperatures rose above 25\u00b0C, the rate of fixation would go down. In a warming world, this would have meant a runaway scenario where nitrogen fixing would decrease as temperatures rose, resulting in less plant productivity. Plants would then remove less CO2 from the atmosphere which would cause further warming and less nitrogen fixing, and so on. In a new paper, Griffin describes how he and his colleagues developed an instrument that enabled them to measure the temperature response of nitrogen on the bacteria that formed an association with the roots of plants, as opposed to on free-living bacteria.\n\u201cWhat we found with our new instrument looking at whole-plant symbioses in temperate and tropical trees, was that the optimal temperature for nitrogen fixation was actually about 5\u00b0C higher than any of these previous estimates, and in some cases as much as 11\u00b0C higher. This needs to be tested over a huge number of plants, but if it holds, it means that the likelihood of nitrogen fixation decreasing is much lower than we thought, which means th\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Everything we eat consists of plants or animals that depend on plants somewhere along the food chain. Plants also form the backbone of natural ecosystems, and they absorb about 30 percent of all the carbon dioxide emitted by humans each year. But as the impacts of climate change worsen, how are higher levels of CO2 in the atmosphere and warmer temperatures affecting the plant world?\nPlants use sunlight, carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and water for photosynthesis to produce oxygen and carbohydrates that plants use for energy and growth.\nRising levels of CO2 in the atmosphere drive an increase in plant photosynthesis\u2014an effect known as the carbon fertilization effect. New research has found that between 1982 and 2020, global plant photosynthesis grew 12 percent, tracking CO2 levels in the atmosphere as they rose 17 percent. The vast majority of this increase in photosynthesis was due to carbon dioxide fertilization.\nIncreased photosynthesis results in more growth in some plants. Scientists have found that in response to elevated CO2 levels, above-ground plant growth increased an average of 21 percent, while below-ground growth increased 28 percent. As a result, some crops such as wheat, rice and soybeans are expected to benefit from increased CO2 with an increase in yields from 12 to 14 percent. The growth of some tropical and sub-tropical grasses and several important crops, including corn, sugar cane, sorghum, and millet, however, are not as affected by increased CO2.\nUnder elevated CO2 concentrations, plants use less water during photosynthesis. Plants have openings called stomata that allow CO2 to be absorbed and moisture to be released into the atmosphere. When CO2 levels rise, plants can maintain a high rate of photosynthesis and partially close their stomata, which can decrease a plant\u2019s water loss between 5 and 20 percent. Scientists have speculated that this could result in plants releasing less water to the atmosphere, thus keeping more on land, in the soil and streams.\nElevated levels of CO2 from climate change may enable plants to benefit from the carbon fertilization effect and use less water to grow, but it\u2019s not all good news for plants. It\u2019s more complicated than that, because climate change is also impacting other factors critical to plants\u2019 growth, such as nutrients, temperature, and water.\nResearchers that studied hundreds of plant species between 1980 and 2017 found that most unfertilized terrestrial ecosystems are becoming deficient in nutrients, particularly nitrogen. They attributed this decrease in nutrients to global changes, including rising temperatures and CO2 levels.\nNitrogen is the most abundant element on Earth, making up about 80 percent of the atmosphere. It is an essential element in DNA and RNA and is needed by plants to make carbohydrates and proteins for growth. However, plants cannot use the nitrogen gas found in the atmosphere because it has two atoms of nitrogen triply bonded together so tightly that they are difficult to break apart into a form plants can use. Lightning has enough energy to break the triple bond, a process called nitrogen fixation. Nitrogen is also fixed in the industrial process that produces fertilizer.\nBut most nitrogen fixation occurs in the soil, where certain kinds of bacteria attach to the roots of plants, such as legumes. The bacteria get carbon from the plant and in a symbiotic exchange, fix the nitrogen, combining it with oxygen or hydrogen into compounds plants can use.\nKevin Griffin, a professor in Columbia University\u2019s Department of Ecology, Evolution and Environmental Biology and the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, explained that most living things have a relatively fixed ratio between carbon and nitrogen. This means that if plants take up more CO2 to create carbohydrates because there\u2019s more CO2 in the atmosphere, the amount of nitrogen in the leaves may be diluted, and a plant\u2019s productivity depends on having enough nitrogen. \u201cIf you increase the CO2 around a leaf or around the plant or around the plot of forest, usually the productivity goes up,\u201d he said. \u201cBut whether or not that increase in productivity lasts and is permanent, can be a function of whether you have [enough] nitrogen. So if nitrogen is limited, it could be that a plant just cannot use that extra CO2 and its boost in productivity can be short lived.\u201d\nTrees currently absorb about a third of human-caused CO2 emissions, but their ability to continue to do this depends on how much nitrogen is available to them. If nitrogen is limited, the benefit of increased CO2 will be limited too.\nEarlier research on nitrogen fixation, based on measurements of free-living bacteria, had predicted that the fixation process works fastest at 25\u00b0C, and that as temperatures rose above 25\u00b0C, the rate of fixation would go down. In a warming world, this would have meant a runaway scenario where nitrogen fixing would decrease as temperatures rose, resulting in less plant productivity. Plants would then remove less CO2 from the atmosphere which would cause further warming and less nitrogen fixing, and so on. In a new paper, Griffin describes how he and his colleagues developed an instrument that enabled them to measure the temperature response of nitrogen on the bacteria that formed an association with the roots of plants, as opposed to on free-living bacteria.\n\u201cWhat we found with our new instrument looking at whole-plant symbioses in temperate and tropical trees, was that the optimal temperature for nitrogen fixation was actually about 5\u00b0C higher than any of these previous estimates, and in some cases as much as 11\u00b0C higher. This needs to be tested over a huge number of plants, but if it holds, it means that the likelihood of nitrogen fixation decreasing is much lower than we thought, which means th\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This process keeps Earth\u2019s surface warmer than it would be without it. It is similar to how a glass greenhouse keeps plants warm.\nWatch this video to learn about the greenhouse effect!\nAs you might expect from the name, the greenhouse effect works \u2026 like a greenhouse! A greenhouse is a building with glass walls and a glass roof. Greenhouses are used to grow plants, such as tomatoes and tropical flowers. They are often used in places that are colder than a plant's natural environment.\nA greenhouse stays warm inside, even during the winter. In the daytime, sunlight passes through the glass into the greenhouse. It warms the soil, plants, and air inside. At night, the soil and plants slowly release this heat. But the glass traps it in, making the greenhouse warmer than it is outside.\nThe greenhouse effect on Earth works much the same way. Certain gases in the atmosphere trap heat like the glass of a greenhouse. These heat-trapping gases are called greenhouse gases.\nDuring the day, sunlight travels through the atmosphere and warms Earth\u2019s surface. Some of that sunlight bounces, or reflects, off the surface back into space. The rest of it gets absorbed and heats up the surface. At night, Earth's surface cools, releasing this heat back into the air. But some of the heat is trapped by the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. That's what keeps our Earth warm enough to support life as we know it.\nThe greenhouse effect increases on Earth when greenhouse gases are added to the atmosphere. They can be added to the air by a variety of sources.\nScientists have found that over the last 100 years extra greenhouse gases have mainly come from a few sources. These are things like burning coal and oil for energy or burning gasoline to run cars and planes. Other sources, such as erupting volcanoes, have also added some greenhouse gases to the air. But those natural additions have been too small to account for the amount of greenhouse gases we measure in the air today.\nTo reduce the greenhouse effect, greenhouse gases need to be taken out of the atmosphere. Earth has a few ways it does this with plants, soil, and oceans.\nAll plants \u2014 from tall trees to blades of grass, and even the tiny plant-like phytoplankton in the ocean \u2014 take in carbon dioxide and give off oxygen. They do this in a process known as photosynthesis. This is when plants take carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight and change it into food (sugar) and oxygen.\nThe soil and ocean also absorb carbon dioxide from the air. It changes into other things over time through chemical reactions. It can also make the soil and ocean more acidic, which can impact plants and animals. For example, ocean acidification can be harmful to many ocean creatures, such as shellfish and coral, as it weakens their shells and skeletons.\nThe Clouds and the Earth\u2019s Radiant Energy System (CERES) instruments measure changes in the greenhouse effect. They collect data to show how much heat is getting trapped on Earth compared to how much is escaping to space. This data has shown that more heat is getting trapped than what is leaving, which is warming the planet.\nNASA also tracks changes in greenhouse gases over time with satellites. The Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2, or OCO-2, and OCO-3 keep track of carbon dioxide in the air. The Earth Source Mineral Dust Source Investigation, or EMIT, satellite can track methane.

They are often used in places that are colder than a plant's natural environment.\nA greenhouse stays warm inside, even during the winter. In the daytime, sunlight passes through the glass into the greenhouse. It warms the soil, plants, and air inside. At night, the soil and plants slowly release this heat. But the glass traps it in, making the greenhouse warmer than it is outside.\nThe greenhouse effect on Earth works much the same way. Certain gases in the atmosphere trap heat like the glass of a greenhouse. These heat-trapping gases are called greenhouse gases.\nDuring the day, sunlight travels through the atmosphere and warms Earth\u2019s surface. Some of that sunlight bounces, or reflects, off the surface back into space. The rest of it gets absorbed and heats up the surface. At night, Earth's surface cools, releasing this heat back into the air. But some of the heat is trapped by the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. That's what keeps our Earth warm enough to support life as we know it.\nThe greenhouse effect increases on Earth when greenhouse gases are added to the atmosphere. They can be added to the air by a variety of sources.\nScientists have found that over the last 100 years extra greenhouse gases have mainly come from a few sources. These are things like burning coal and oil for energy or burning gasoline to run cars and planes. Other sources, such as erupting volcanoes, have also added some greenhouse gases to the air. But those natural additions have been too small to account for the amount of greenhouse gases we measure in the air today.\nTo reduce the greenhouse effect, greenhouse gases need to be taken out of the atmosphere. Earth has a few ways it does this with plants, soil, and oceans.\nAll plants \u2014 from tall trees to blades of grass, and even the tiny plant-like phytoplankton in the ocean \u2014 take in carbon dioxide and give off oxygen. They do this in a process known as photosynthesis. This is when plants take carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight and change it into food (sugar) and oxygen.\nThe soil and ocean also absorb carbon dioxide from the air. It changes into other things over time through chemical reactions. It can also make the soil and ocean more acidic, which can impact plants and animals. For example, ocean acidification can be harmful to many ocean creatures, such as shellfish and coral, as it weakens their shells and skeletons.\nThe Clouds and the Earth\u2019s Radiant Energy System (CERES) instruments measure changes in the greenhouse effect. They collect data to show how much heat is getting trapped on Earth compared to how much is escaping to space. This data has shown that more heat is getting trapped than what is leaving, which is warming the planet.\nNASA also tracks changes in greenhouse gases over time with satellites. The Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2, or OCO-2, and OCO-3 keep track of carbon dioxide in the air. The Earth Source Mineral Dust Source Investigation, or EMIT, satellite can track methane. Other satellites, like the Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem, or PACE, measure changes in the ocean.\nAqua\u2019s main goal is to improve our understanding of Earth's water cycle.\nOCO-2 is the first spacecraft dedicated to studying carbon dioxide in Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\nOCO-3 is a near replica of OCO-2 and measures carbon dioxide in our atmosphere to help us understand the relationship between plants and carbon dioxide.\nThis mission studies phytoplankton (a type of tiny algae), ocean color and measures atmospheric particles and clouds.\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",
