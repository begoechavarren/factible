As many as 50 percent drop out within the first six months. Research suggests that one possible reason is that many people don\u2019t enjoy vigorous physical activity. In fact, various researchers have suggested that, for many people, an inverse relationship exists between physical activity enjoyment and the intensity of exercise. This relationship is illustrated in the accompanying figure.\nAs the intensity of physical activity increases, the enjoyment of the exercise (while performing it) decreases. For many people, moderate activity is more enjoyable than vigorous activity. But reaping health benefits from moderate exercise requires longer sessions, and lack of time is often cited as a reason for not being active. High-intensity exercise can be done in a short period of time, but it is not enjoyable for many people, which can lead to lack of adherence. This is known as the intensity\u2013enjoyment trade-off.\nAt first glance, the trade-off may cause some people to be discouraged about becoming more active: \u201cIf I have little time to exercise, I can do short-duration intense exercise, which may be unenjoyable. On the other hand, if I do less-intense exercise that I may find more enjoyable, it will take longer than the time I can spare.\u201d But recent research suggests that not all people find vigorous activity to be unenjoyable. The key seems to be self-selection: If you choose the vigorous activity that you perform, you are more likely to enjoy it.\nThis information has implications for physical education, especially since helping students to be active in and out of school is an important program goal.

As many as 50 percent drop out within the first six months. Research suggests that one possible reason is that many people don\u2019t enjoy vigorous physical activity. In fact, various researchers have suggested that, for many people, an inverse relationship exists between physical activity enjoyment and the intensity of exercise. This relationship is illustrated in the accompanying figure.\nAs the intensity of physical activity increases, the enjoyment of the exercise (while performing it) decreases. For many people, moderate activity is more enjoyable than vigorous activity. But reaping health benefits from moderate exercise requires longer sessions, and lack of time is often cited as a reason for not being active. High-intensity exercise can be done in a short period of time, but it is not enjoyable for many people, which can lead to lack of adherence. This is known as the intensity\u2013enjoyment trade-off.\nAt first glance, the trade-off may cause some people to be discouraged about becoming more active: \u201cIf I have little time to exercise, I can do short-duration intense exercise, which may be unenjoyable. On the other hand, if I do less-intense exercise that I may find more enjoyable, it will take longer than the time I can spare.\u201d But recent research suggests that not all people find vigorous activity to be unenjoyable. The key seems to be self-selection: If you choose the vigorous activity that you perform, you are more likely to enjoy it.\nThis information has implications for physical education, especially since helping students to be active in and out of school is an important program goal.

That\u2019s a 2.2% increase from 2022, making it the highest number of people that have ever participated in an activity in one year. What\u2019s more, the number of Americans who participated in an activity has increased every single year for 10 years, growing by 5 million in 2023.\nAll of this good news comes from the recently published \u201c2024 Sports, Fitness, and Leisure Activities Topline Participation Report,\u201d issued annually by the Sports & Fitness Industry Association (SFIA).\nAll seven major sport and fitness physical activity categories showed increased year-over-year rates of participation, according to the report, which SFIA says is considered the sports and fitness industry\u2019s essential reference for participation, as it tracks Americans 6 and up across 124 different sports, fitness and outdoor activities.\n\u201cThese participation numbers are positive for the country and for our industry,\u201d Tom Cove, SFIA president & CEO, said in a statement. \u201cFrankly, they are not a surprise, as we know Americans are valuing and pursuing active lifestyles post-pandemic. Our industry\u2019s role now is to fulfill that interest with positive sports and fitness experiences and quality, innovative and inspiring products.\u201d\nParticipation in winter sports, team sports, racquet sports and water sports all grew by more 9% last year. Winter sports, fueled by favorable weather conditions, led with 22% growth over 2022, and team sports weighed in with 10.8% growth. Notably, 20 of the 24 sports tracked in the team sports category showed increases (compared to only five the previous year). Swimming on a team lead the way with a 14.8% year-over-year increase, followed by court volleyball with a 13.4% year-over-year increase.\nThis reflects an increasing trend in the United States of strong demand for team sports opportunities, according to the SFIA, following dissolution of teams during the pandemic in 2020. The number of team sports participants now exceeds pre-COVID levels from 2019.\nAlso noteworthy is that, for the third year in a row, pickleball is the fastest-growing sport in America. Participation jumped 51.8% from 2022 to 2023 \u2014 and a whopping 223.5% in three years. The number of pickleball participants stands at 13.6 million, approaching the number of outdoor soccer players (14.1 million). Pickleball contributed to the overall healthy participation trends seen in racquet sports, which reflect continued robust participation numbers in tennis, too.\nTrend analysis from the SFIA report also highlights the fitness category, where many health club-based activities such as using a treadmill, stair-climber and rowing machine \u2014 plus group activities like barre, Pilates and yoga \u2014 saw participation gains in 2023.\nOther highlights of the report:\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that inactivity decreased to its lowest number since the SFIA began tracking the metric: Just 21.2%, or 64.9 million people, reported doing none of the 124 activities at least once.
