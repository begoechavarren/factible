    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\n7.1 billion people on this planet are completely in the dark The Continuous and escalating extreme weather events occurring every day around the planet are blamed on mother nature but nothing could be further from the [Music] truth all that is required to understand explain and demonstrate how Decades of global geoengineering development is directly and deliberately responsible for all of the Super Storms hurricanes tornadoes and floods is the understanding of a few simple [Music] Concepts however to find un altered explanations of these Concepts we must first travel back 60 years [Music] rain rain go away come again some other day two young fellas want to play one is Fred he lives in this Farm the other is Pete he lives in the city he's visiting [Music] friend boy where does all this rain come from from the sky everybody knows that [Music] but what Pete really wants to know is how does the water get into the sky well let's see Fred sees one way as the water dries off the horses it goes into the air but there are lots of other ways when the sun comes out strongly after a shower we can almost see the water disappearing into the air [Music] here heat from the Sun is drying the roof water at the top edge of the puddle slowly disappears into the air right before our eyes billions of gallons of water go into the air every hour from the ponds lakes rivers and oceans all over the world in fact everything that dries as giving water to the air even wet Fields do [Music] this and wet clothes on a line slowly lose water to the air and become [Music] dry whether you can see it or whether you can't water is always going into the air from many things even dogs give water to the air as they pant [Music] people as well as animals have to replace the water their bodies give off to the [Music] air yep there's another way water can get into the air the water on the doghouse roof dried pretty fast in the warm sun this this water disappears faster because the stove is hotter this change from water we can see to water vapor we can't see is called [Music] evaporation no that's not evaporation that water isn't changing to water vapor it's just sinking into the soil evaporation comes later the leaves give off water to the air water taken up of the plant's Roots it's hard to believe so let's find out if it's true first a cardboard disc to cover the wet soil then a jar to keep any water vapor from the leaves from being lost to the air and the jar without a [Music] plan and last time until tomorrow [Music] morning during the night the plant gave off water because the jar without the plant is dry inside the jar are droplets just like the droplets that form in the moisture from Fred's warm breath hits the window glass the water vapor changes into very small drops of water because the window is cold in the same way the water vapor from the plant changed to water when it touched the cooler surface of the jar but what happens if the glass is warm the best way to answer such a question is to try [Music] it first a glass is [Music] warm then another glass is chilled [Music] what happens with the warm glass nothing but soon on the cold glass glass water collects water from the air when this happens it's called condensation condensation causes dew on the grass during the night when the earth and grass is cooler than the air condensation takes place and the water vapor forms little drops of water the cloud from the spot of the teac kettle is condensation of the water vapor from the teac kettle hitting the colder air the water vapor in the warm air of the room forms a cloud as it hits the very cold air from the refrigerator [Music] uh-oh now what's going to happen [Music] condensation rain [Music] the hot water in the kettle gives off water vapor to the air by rapid evaporation just as rivers lakes and ponds give off water vapor to the air by slow evaporation as the hot water-filled air hits the colder air near the ice tray the water vapor turns into clouds of tiny water droplets floating in the air condensation when the air is quite cold and cannot hold any more water droplets they collect together to form larger drops as on the ice tray and being too heavy to float in the air they fall back to the Earth as [Music] rain without water in the air we couldn't live our Fields would be dry and nothing would grow because water evaporates in the air and returns again as rain we have water running through the valleys in our Brooks and streams filling reservoirs with water to drink turning our water wheels and turning the turbines and the powerhouses to give us electricity all from water in the air the fundamentals of global geoengineering are no different than this child's experiment water vapor is artificially introduced into the air in place of the natural evaporation stage and is artificially cooled and condensed to produce [Music] rain you need a great many tea kettal to produce the massive amounts of water vapor required to fuel these Global storm systems and this planet is deliberately covered with them [Music] [Music] this artificial precipitation generation is easy to see on infrared satellite and is identified by sudden coordinated bursts of superheated water vapor from no natural source [Music] [Music] ironically the same primary source of CO2 Emissions on this planet is the same source of artificial [Music] precipitation this Nationwide artificial precipitation generation site clickers like clockwork every single day [Music] hexagonal Center of Vortex with flat size proves geoengineering manufacturer nightly Nationwide coordinated artificial precipitation generation Noti is the total absence of natural precipitation before the nightly generation cycle [Music] manufactured vortex in exactly the same area rotating in the opposite direction twin vortices rotating in opposite directions Drive artificial precipitation to the southeast [Music] [Music] [Music] the same identifying cycle of circular and sudden coordinated bursts of artificial precipitation can be seen all around the world in every industrialized and colonized country [Music] in [Music] [Music] [Music] this man-made Global artificial precipitation cycle is the singular reason for massive and continuous flooding worldwide at least nine states with flash flood watches Coast to Coast tonight in Newton North Carolina look at this the water suddenly Rising above the windows of this family's home you can barely see the tops of their cars there and this roadway washed away a giant collapse under the rains today this as we get new information tonight on those two tropical systems big changes there as well we get to it all beginning with the flooding and the pictures just now coming in here's ABC meteorologist Ginger Z tonight chest deep Rescuers pulling people to Safety in Western North Carolina at least 10 Swiftwater rescues already today thanks I just it was raining so hard I did not see like any of that a state of emergency declared in cataba County more than a foot of rain in less than 24 hours busting storm drains and swallowing street signs and mailboxes it's bad it come up fast since 9:00 it probably come up 3T from the drowning Southeast to the wild Southwest that is Albuquerque New Mexico just yesterday near 90 m per hour wind gust sliced through the typically tranquil Town pour down like like a hurricane people plucked from their flooded cars the desert rains swamping the streets near Tucson Arizona the millions of tons of heavy metal nanen trails and frequency activated ice nucleation used to control these storm systems is a topic for another [Music] video however don't believe that mother nature monsoons in the United States or any other fairy tale is responsible for worldwide man-made flooding that you can't see with your own eyes look up",

Population Division estimates the world population reached 8 billion on November 15, 2022.\nOnly around 4% of the world population (all in Africa) lives in a country with very high fertility \u2014 above 5 children per woman. Even in countries with very high fertility, fertility is generally lower than it was in the past.\nWhy the discrepancy? Many of the world\u2019s most populous countries (such as India and Nigeria), haven\u2019t conducted a census in over 10 years, and many countries lack civil registration and vital statistics systems that accurately record births and deaths among their population.\nGiven the lack of precise population data worldwide, the U.N. and Census Bureau estimates are not that far apart, and both imply similar overall trends.\nThe rate of growth peaked decades ago in the 1960s and has been declining since and is projected to continue declining.\nWhile it took 12.5 years for the world to go from 7 billion to 8 billion people, we project it will likely take 14.1 years to go from 8 billion to 9 billion, and another 16.4 years to go from 9 billion to 10 billion.\nDespite a slowdown, we project the world population will reach 10.2 billion by 2060.\nThese broad global trends mask wide diversity. Population growth is the result of fertility, mortality, migration and the share of the population at certain ages. These trends all differ from country to country and, as a result, population growth varies around the world.\nNearly three quarters (74%) of the earth\u2019s population reside in countries where fertility is around or below the replacement level.\nIt is widely believed that 2.1 is the replacement-level fertility rate \u2014 the number of births a woman would need to have in her lifetime to replace herself and the father. However, the precise level of fertility necessary for long-term replacement varies between countries due to different mortality rates.\nAround 33% of the world population \u2014 approximately 1 in 3 people \u2014 lives in a country with a fertility rate close to replacement, including diverse countries such as India, Tunisia and Argentina.\nDemographers once assumed fertility would stop declining once it reached replacement levels. But it has continued to decline below replacement levels in many countries.\nAround 15% of the world\u2019s population lives in a country with low fertility of 1.6 to 1.8 children per woman. This includes a diverse range of countries like Brazil, Mexico, the United States and Sweden.\nAnother 26% \u2014 about 1 in 4 people \u2014 lives in a country with very low fertility at 1.5 children or fewer per woman. Such countries include China, South Korea and Spain.\nAnother 23% lives in a country with moderately high fertility between 2.3 and 5.0 children. This broad category includes a diverse range of countries like Papua New Guinea, Israel and Ethiopia.\nOnly around 4% of the world population (all in Africa) lives in a country with very high fertility \u2014 above 5 children per woman. Even in countries with very high fertility, fertility is generally lower than it was in the past.\nAnd we project that by 2060, no country will have an average of four or more children per woman, let alone five or six children per woman.\nIt\u2019s projected that Benin will have the world\u2019s highest projected total fertility rate (3.8) in 2060. There will, of course, still be women who have four or more children, but it is unlikely entire countries will average four or more children per woman.\nThe world population is projected to keep growing despite declining fertility rates. In fact, we estimate the number of infants already peaked in 2017. Instead, population growth in the future will come from larger groups of people at adult ages. Demographers call this phenomenon population momentum.\nFigure 3 shows the world population by age in 2023 and the projected population by age in 2060. Population growth between now and 2060 will be from the population pyramid \u201cfilling up\u201d previously sparse older age groups, not from growing numbers of births.\nFigure 4 shows how the growth of the older-adult population is projected to make up most of the population growth between now and 2060. Future population growth will be coincident with population aging.\nAs fertility declines, there are proportionally fewer younger people and more older people.\nThe share of the population at young ages has been declining. Today, 32% of people are 19 or younger. By 2060, that number is projected to slip to 26%.\nAs the share of young people declines, the proportion of people at older ages increases. Today, 10% of the world is 65 or older and their share is projected to double to 20% by 2060.\nAs a result, the median age is changing. Today, the global median age is 32 (half the population is younger and half older). By 2060, however, the global median age is projected to climb to 39 years.\nThese general trends vary by country. Niger is the world\u2019s youngest country, with a median age of 15 in 2023. Monaco, by contrast, is the oldest, with a median age of 56 in 2023.\nIn many countries where young-age mortality is already low, gains in life expectancy come from improving conditions at older ages.\nCanada, for instance, did not experience big declines in young-age mortality between 2000 and 2023, but its total life expectancy increased by an average of about 4 years, largely from reduced mortality at older ages.\nFor many other countries, however, life expectancy trends are driven more by dramatic declines in child mortality. In Niger, for example, child mortality declined from around 224 deaths of children under 5 per 1,000 births in 2000 to 103 deaths per 1,\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

More moisture in a warmer atmosphere is fueling intense hurricanes and flooding rains.\n\nFull Page Content:\nAs autumn arrives, the peak of Atlantic hurricane season is upon us, and the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere plays a major role in the strength of tropical cyclones. To quantify water vapor, meteorologists use the term \u201cprecipitable water vapor\u201d (PWV) to describe the amount of water vapor contained in a column of air extending from the surface to the top of the atmosphere.\nThe most intuitive way to think about PWV is to imagine a wet towel that represents the water vapor in the atmosphere and then picture that wet towel as it is completely wrung out into a glass. The volume of the water in that glass would be the total amount of PWV, as if that water vapor had precipitated from the atmosphere to the ground. Total column water vapor (TCWV) is technically the correct term to describe this measurement; however, in practice, PWV and TCWV are used interchangeably since the total amount of PWV over an area is normally the quantity forecasters are interested in.\nMeasuring PWV normally requires the use of radiosondes, which are launched by NASA, weather organizations, and meteorological offices around the world. These instruments measure the atmospheric humidity (in addition to many other variables) at different levels of the atmosphere, creating a sounding, or vertical profile, of the atmosphere. The sounding of atmospheric humidity can then be used to compute PWV.\nThough radiosondes are reliable, the spatial coverage (a single point) and temporal coverage (twice daily) leaves many gaps in the data around the world, especially over the oceans (NOAA, 2014). Instruments such as NASA\u2019s Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) have the capability to produce soundings worldwide twice a day (NASA, 2021). AIRS soundings have helped to provide PWV measurements worldwide for over two decades (Figure 1), filling in gaps to complement radiosonde measurements and providing vital information to weather models.\nFigure 1. Monthly Average Daily TCWV from AIRS for July 2025 (image produced with NASA\u2019s Giovanni). Values are shaded according to the color palette values displayed on the right in kilograms per meter squared (kg/m2) or millimeters. 1 kg/m2 of water is equal to the depth of 1 mm of water over a square meter. Credit: GES DISC\nAreas of high PWV alert forecasters to the potential for heavy precipitation rates and flash flooding. Tropical cyclones are fueled by the condensation of moisture, and areas of high PWV provide ample amounts, enabling the storms to rapidly strengthen and produce extremely heavy rain and wind.\nHigh sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are also widely known to strengthen tropical cyclones. This, however, is only half the story. Water evaporation increases in areas of high SSTs. The additional water vapor provided to the lower atmosphere from the ocean surface is then wrapped around into the cyclone (Figure 2), causing the storm to strengthen and, in some cases, rapidly intensify.\nFigure 2. Schematic of the air flow inside and surrounding a tropical cyclone. Credit: NASA SpacePlace\nPWV is commonly reported as the total column value, but as previously mentioned, the link between SSTs and tropical cyclones is the water vapor evaporated from the ocean surface. Therefore, the lower-level PWV, and not the TCWV (in some cases), may be more representative of the moisture fueling a tropical cyclone.\nNASA instruments such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS) aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites provide lower-atmosphere PWV products such as MOD08_D3 and MY08_D3, which provide measurements from the surface to 680 millibars. These data are useful in quantifying the lower-level moisture, though users are limited to investigating a predetermined atmospheric layer depth.\nThe AIRS instrument provides soundings of water vapor mixing ratio (WVMR), which represents the ratio of the mass of water vapor to dry air, typically expressed in grams per kilogram (g/kg). WVMR is computed using variables such as dewpoint temperature and pressure. These variables are simpler to measure rather than directly measuring the amount water vapor itself, and therefore WVMR is the variable usually reported from a sounding (Figure 3).\nThe vertical distribution of WVMR can then be integrated to approximate the PWV between any two pressure levels of the atmosphere through a short sequence of equations involving the assumption of atmospheric hydrostatic balance and dividing by the density of the air (The COMET Program/MetEd, 2018).\nFigure 3. Area-Averaged AIRS Water Vapor Mixing Ratio Vertical Profile from NASA\u2019s Giovanni on August 24, 2017, over coastal Texas. The x-axis represents the water vapor mixing ratio in g/kg, air pressure is shown on the y-axis with logarithmic scaling, and each tick represents 100 hectopascals (hPa).\nThe map in the upper-right corner shows the spatial bounds of the domain used to compute the vertical profile. Credit: GES DISC\nFor users interested in quickly obtaining PWV, the quantity can be estimated graphically from WVMR by using an average mixing ratio between two pressure levels. NASA\u2019s Giovanni makes it simple to obtain soundings of WVMR from AIRS using its vertical profile function.\nFigure 3 shows an AIRS WVMR sounding of coastal Texas the day before Hurricane Harvey's devastating landfall in 2017. This sounding represents a snapshot of the water vapor available directly preceding Harvey's rapid intensification into Category 4 status. Note the high levels of WVMR near the surface: this is one factor that likely contributed to the strengthening of Harvey.\nUsers of NASA\u2019s Giovanni can plot their own AIRS WVMR vertical profile and follow this step-by-step tutorial to estimate the PWV at different levels of the atmosphere prior to Hurricane Harvey\u2019s landfall, or they can use the same steps to estimate PWV for their own purposes. With hurricane season in full swing, information about PWV is critical, and instruments like NASA's AIRS can help provide forecasters with vital\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

A Little-Known Heater\n\nGoogle Search Snippet:\nMore vapour in the atmosphere means more energy available to fuel intense rainfall, destructive storms, and extreme weather events. The good ...\n\nFull Page Content:\n5 MIN READ\nWater vapor is Earth\u2019s most abundant greenhouse gas. It\u2019s responsible for about half of Earth\u2019s greenhouse effect \u2014 the process that occurs when gases in Earth\u2019s atmosphere trap the Sun\u2019s heat. Greenhouse gases keep our planet livable. Without them, Earth\u2019s surface temperature would be about 59 degrees Fahrenheit (33 degrees Celsius) colder. Water vapor is also a key part of Earth\u2019s water cycle: the path that all water follows as it moves around Earth\u2019s atmosphere, land, and ocean as liquid water, solid ice, and gaseous water vapor.\nSince the late 1800s, global average surface temperatures have increased by about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius). Data from satellites, weather balloons, and ground measurements confirm the amount of atmospheric water vapor is increasing as the climate warms. (The United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report states total atmospheric water vapor is increasing 1 to 2% per decade.) For every degree Celsius that Earth\u2019s atmospheric temperature rises, the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere can increase by about 7%, according to the laws of thermodynamics.\nSome people mistakenly believe water vapor is the main driver of Earth\u2019s current warming. But increased water vapor doesn\u2019t cause global warming. Instead, it\u2019s a consequence of it. Increased water vapor in the atmosphere amplifies the warming caused by other greenhouse gases.\nIt works like this: As greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane increase, Earth\u2019s temperature rises in response. This increases evaporation from both water and land areas. Because warmer air holds more moisture, its concentration of water vapor increases. Specifically, this happens because water vapor does not condense and precipitate out of the atmosphere as easily at higher temperatures. The water vapor then absorbs heat radiated from Earth and prevents it from escaping out to space. This further warms the atmosphere, resulting in even more water vapor in the atmosphere. This is what scientists call a \"positive feedback loop.\" Scientists estimate this effect more than doubles the warming that would happen due to increasing carbon dioxide alone.\nThe greenhouse gases in the dry air in Earth\u2019s atmosphere include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, and chlorofluorocarbons. While making up around 0.05% of Earth\u2019s total atmosphere, they play major roles in trapping Earth\u2019s radiant heat from the Sun and keeping it from escaping into space. Each is driven directly by human activities.\nAll five of these greenhouse gases are non-condensable. Non-condensable gases can\u2019t be changed into liquid at the very cold temperatures present at the top of Earth\u2019s troposphere, where it meets the stratosphere. As atmospheric temperatures change, the concentration of non-condensable gases remains stable.\nBut water vapor is a different animal. It\u2019s condensable \u2013 it can be changed from a gas into a liquid. Its concentration depends on the temperature of the atmosphere. This makes water vapor the only greenhouse gas whose concentration increases because the atmosphere is warming, and causes it to warm even more.\nIf non-condensable gases weren\u2019t increasing, the amount of atmospheric water vapor would be unchanged from its pre-industrial revolution levels.\nCarbon dioxide is responsible for a third of the total warming of Earth\u2019s climate due to human-produced greenhouse gases. Small increases in its concentration have major effects. A key reason is the length of time carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere.\nMethane, carbon dioxide, and chlorofluorocarbons don\u2019t condense, and they aren\u2019t particularly chemically reactive or easily broken down by light in the troposphere. For these reasons, they remain in the atmosphere for anywhere from years to centuries or even longer, depending on the gas.\nIn contrast, a molecule of water vapor stays in the atmosphere just nine days, on average. It then gets recycled as rain or snow. Its amounts don\u2019t accumulate, despite its much larger relative quantities.\n\u201cCarbon dioxide and other non-condensable greenhouse gases act as control knobs for the climate,\u201d said Andrew Dessler, a professor of Atmospheric Sciences at Texas A&M University in College Station. \u201cAs humans add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, small changes in climate are amplified by changes in water vapor.

They contribute to making wet regions wetter and dry regions drier. The more water vapor that air contains, the more energy it holds. This energy fuels intense storms, particularly over land.

Delayed actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are projected to have irreversible effects on Earth's system and weather events with dire consequences for society and ecosystems. Geoengineering could be an opportunity to mitigate the worst impacts until emission and greenhouse gas concentration reductions have been effective. In particular, approaches that globally reflect sunlight have a large potential to reduce global temperatures based on recent model studies. At this time, however, it is not known if geoengineering is a viable solution, and a lot of work is needed to understand potential benefits, side effects, and risks of different approaches, in order to appropriately inform society and stakeholders.\nThe full effect of global geoengineering can only be tested using computer models. Comprehensive Earth System Models are required that represent the most important processes essential to simulate different potential geoengineering proposals. In recent years NCAR's state-of-the-art Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) has been developed to include interactive coupling between aerosols, chemistry, radiation, and environment. A WACCM model study performed simulations over the period of the recent largest volcanic eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in 1991, and demonstrated excellent agreement with observations in terms of aerosol movement, radiative changes, and chemical response (see Figure). Current and future developments of ACOM models are essential to provide the community with important tools for geoengineering research.\nProject Team: Simone Tilmes [tilmes@ucar.edu], Jadwiga H.

Simulations were performed in 2017 on the new NCAR Cheyenne supercomputer, using the Advanced Science Discovery allocations. A comprehensive set of model output has been made available to the community on the NCAR Climate Data Gateway. This enables the community to explore the effects of solar geoengineering on the Earth system based on a multiple ensemble dataset.

But it has continued to decline below replacement levels in many countries.\nAround 15% of the world\u2019s population lives in a country with low fertility of 1.6 to 1.8 children per woman. This includes a diverse range of countries like Brazil, Mexico, the United States and Sweden.\nAnother 26% \u2014 about 1 in 4 people \u2014 lives in a country with very low fertility at 1.5 children or fewer per woman.

This broad category includes a diverse range of countries like Papua New Guinea, Israel and Ethiopia.\nOnly around 4% of the world population (all in Africa) lives in a country with very high fertility \u2014 above 5 children per woman. Even in countries with very high fertility, fertility is generally lower than it was in the past.\nAnd we project that by 2060, no country will have an average of four or more children per woman, let alone five or six children per woman.\nIt\u2019s projected that Benin will have the world\u2019s highest projected total fertility rate (3.8) in 2060. There will, of course, still be women who have four or more children, but it is unlikely entire countries will average four or more children per woman.\nThe world population is projected to keep growing despite declining fertility rates. In fact, we estimate the number of infants already peaked in 2017. Instead, population growth in the future will come from larger groups of people at adult ages. Demographers call this phenomenon population momentum.\nFigure 3 shows the world population by age in 2023 and the projected population by age in 2060. Population growth between now and 2060 will be from the population pyramid \u201cfilling up\u201d previously sparse older age groups, not from growing numbers of births.\nFigure 4 shows how the growth of the older-adult population is projected to make up most of the population growth between now and 2060. Future population growth will be coincident with population aging.\nAs fertility declines, there are proportionally fewer younger people and more older people.\nThe share of the population at young ages has been declining. Today, 32% of people are 19 or younger. By 2060, that number is projected to slip to 26%.\nAs the share of young people declines, the proportion of people at older ages increases. Today, 10% of the world is 65 or older and their share is projected to double to 20% by 2060.\nAs a result, the median age is changing. Today, the global median age is 32 (half the population is younger and half older). By 2060, however, the global median age is projected to climb to 39 years.\nThese general trends vary by country. Niger is the world\u2019s youngest country, with a median age of 15 in 2023.

To quantify water vapor, meteorologists use the term \u201cprecipitable water vapor\u201d (PWV) to describe the amount of water vapor contained in a column of air extending from the surface to the top of the atmosphere.\nThe most intuitive way to think about PWV is to imagine a wet towel that represents the water vapor in the atmosphere and then picture that wet towel as it is completely wrung out into a glass. The volume of the water in that glass would be the total amount of PWV, as if that water vapor had precipitated from the atmosphere to the ground. Total column water vapor (TCWV) is technically the correct term to describe this measurement; however, in practice, PWV and TCWV are used interchangeably since the total amount of PWV over an area is normally the quantity forecasters are interested in.\nMeasuring PWV normally requires the use of radiosondes, which are launched by NASA, weather organizations, and meteorological offices around the world. These instruments measure the atmospheric humidity (in addition to many other variables) at different levels of the atmosphere, creating a sounding, or vertical profile, of the atmosphere. The sounding of atmospheric humidity can then be used to compute PWV.\nThough radiosondes are reliable, the spatial coverage (a single point) and temporal coverage (twice daily) leaves many gaps in the data around the world, especially over the oceans (NOAA, 2014). Instruments such as NASA\u2019s Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) have the capability to produce soundings worldwide twice a day (NASA, 2021). AIRS soundings have helped to provide PWV measurements worldwide for over two decades (Figure 1), filling in gaps to complement radiosonde measurements and providing vital information to weather models.\nFigure 1. Monthly Average Daily TCWV from AIRS for July 2025 (image produced with NASA\u2019s Giovanni). Values are shaded according to the color palette values displayed on the right in kilograms per meter squared (kg/m2) or millimeters. 1 kg/m2 of water is equal to the depth of 1 mm of water over a square meter. Credit: GES DISC\nAreas of high PWV alert forecasters to the potential for heavy precipitation rates and flash flooding. Tropical cyclones are fueled by the condensation of moisture, and areas of high PWV provide ample amounts, enabling the storms to rapidly strengthen and produce extremely heavy rain and wind.\nHigh sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are also widely known to strengthen tropical cyclones. This, however, is only half the story. Water evaporation increases in areas of high SSTs. The additional water vapor provided to the lower atmosphere from the ocean surface is then wrapped around into the cyclone (Figure 2), causing the storm to strengthen and, in some cases, rapidly intensify.\nFigure 2. Schematic of the air flow inside and surrounding a tropical cyclone. Credit: NASA SpacePlace\nPWV is commonly reported as the total column value, but as previously mentioned, the link between SSTs and tropical cyclones is the water vapor evaporated from the ocean surface. Therefore, the lower-level PWV, and not the TCWV (in some cases), may be more representative of the moisture fueling a tropical cyclone.\nNASA instruments such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS) aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites provide lower-atmosphere PWV products such as MOD08_D3 and MY08_D3, which provide measurements from the surface to 680 millibars. These data are useful in quantifying the lower-level moisture, though users are limited to investigating a predetermined atmospheric layer depth.\nThe AIRS instrument provides soundings of water vapor mixing ratio (WVMR), which represents the ratio of the mass of water vapor to dry air, typically expressed in grams per kilogram (g/kg). WVMR is computed using variables such as dewpoint temperature and pressure. These variables are simpler to measure rather than directly measuring the amount water vapor itself, and therefore WVMR is the variable usually reported from a sounding (Figure 3).\nThe vertical distribution of WVMR can then be integrated to approximate the PWV between any two pressure levels of the atmosphere through a short sequence of equations involving the assumption of atmospheric hydrostatic balance and dividing by the density of the air (The COMET Program/MetEd, 2018).\nFigure 3. Area-Averaged AIRS Water Vapor Mixing Ratio Vertical Profile from NASA\u2019s Giovanni on August 24, 2017, over coastal Texas. The x-axis represents the water vapor mixing ratio in g/kg, air pressure is shown on the y-axis with logarithmic scaling, and each tick represents 100 hectopascals (hPa).\nThe map in the upper-right corner shows the spatial bounds of the domain used to compute the vertical profile. Credit: GES DISC\nFor users interested in quickly obtaining PWV, the quantity can be estimated graphically from WVMR by using an average mixing ratio between two pressure levels. NASA\u2019s Giovanni makes it simple to obtain soundings of WVMR from AIRS using its vertical profile function.\nFigure 3 shows an AIRS WVMR sounding of coastal Texas the day before Hurricane Harvey's devastating landfall in 2017. This sounding represents a snapshot of the water vapor available directly preceding Harvey's rapid intensification into Category 4 status. Note the high levels of WVMR near the surface: this is one factor that likely contributed to the strengthening of Harvey.\nUsers of NASA\u2019s Giovanni can plot their own AIRS WVMR vertical profile and follow this step-by-step tutorial to estimate the PWV at different levels of the atmosphere prior to Hurricane Harvey\u2019s landfall, or they can use the same steps to estimate PWV for their own purposes. With hurricane season in full swing, information about PWV is critical, and instruments like NASA's AIRS can help provide forecasters with vital\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

In Niger, for example, child mortality declined from around 224 deaths of children under 5 per 1,000 births in 2000 to 103 deaths per 1,\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

More moisture in a warmer atmosphere is fueling intense hurricanes and flooding rains.\n\nFull Page Content:\n5 MIN READ\nWater vapor is Earth\u2019s most abundant greenhouse gas. It\u2019s responsible for about half of Earth\u2019s greenhouse effect \u2014 the process that occurs when gases in Earth\u2019s atmosphere trap the Sun\u2019s heat. Greenhouse gases keep our planet livable. Without them, Earth\u2019s surface temperature would be about 59 degrees Fahrenheit (33 degrees Celsius) colder. Water vapor is also a key part of Earth\u2019s water cycle: the path that all water follows as it moves around Earth\u2019s atmosphere, land, and ocean as liquid water, solid ice, and gaseous water vapor.\nSince the late 1800s, global average surface temperatures have increased by about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius). Data from satellites, weather balloons, and ground measurements confirm the amount of atmospheric water vapor is increasing as the climate warms. (The United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report states total atmospheric water vapor is increasing 1 to 2% per decade.) For every degree Celsius that Earth\u2019s atmospheric temperature rises, the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere can increase by about 7%, according to the laws of thermodynamics.\nSome people mistakenly believe water vapor is the main driver of Earth\u2019s current warming. But increased water vapor doesn\u2019t cause global warming. Instead, it\u2019s a consequence of it. Increased water vapor in the atmosphere amplifies the warming caused by other greenhouse gases.\nIt works like this: As greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane increase, Earth\u2019s temperature rises in response. This increases evaporation from both water and land areas. Because warmer air holds more moisture, its concentration of water vapor increases. Specifically, this happens because water vapor does not condense and precipitate out of the atmosphere as easily at higher temperatures. The water vapor then absorbs heat radiated from Earth and prevents it from escaping out to space. This further warms the atmosphere, resulting in even more water vapor in the atmosphere. This is what scientists call a \"positive feedback loop.\" Scientists estimate this effect more than doubles the warming that would happen due to increasing carbon dioxide alone.\nThe greenhouse gases in the dry air in Earth\u2019s atmosphere include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, and chlorofluorocarbons. While making up around 0.05% of Earth\u2019s total atmosphere, they play major roles in trapping Earth\u2019s radiant heat from the Sun and keeping it from escaping into space. Each is driven directly by human activities.\nAll five of these greenhouse gases are non-condensable. Non-condensable gases can\u2019t be changed into liquid at the very cold temperatures present at the top of Earth\u2019s troposphere, where it meets the stratosphere. As atmospheric temperatures change, the concentration of non-condensable gases remains stable.\nBut water vapor is a different animal. It\u2019s condensable \u2013 it can be changed from a gas into a liquid. Its concentration depends on the temperature of the atmosphere. This makes water vapor the only greenhouse gas whose concentration increases because the atmosphere is warming, and causes it to warm even more.\nIf non-condensable gases weren\u2019t increasing, the amount of atmospheric water vapor would be unchanged from its pre-industrial revolution levels.\nCarbon dioxide is responsible for a third of the total warming of Earth\u2019s climate due to human-produced greenhouse gases. Small increases in its concentration have major effects. A key reason is the length of time carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere.\nMethane, carbon dioxide, and chlorofluorocarbons don\u2019t condense, and they aren\u2019t particularly chemically reactive or easily broken down by light in the troposphere. For these reasons, they remain in the atmosphere for anywhere from years to centuries or even longer, depending on the gas.\nIn contrast, a molecule of water vapor stays in the atmosphere just nine days, on average. It then gets recycled as rain or snow. Its amounts don\u2019t accumulate, despite its much larger relative quantities.\n\u201cCarbon dioxide and other non-condensable greenhouse gases act as control knobs for the climate,\u201d said Andrew Dessler, a professor of Atmospheric Sciences at Texas A&M University in College Station. \u201cAs humans add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, small changes in climate are amplified by changes in water vapor. This makes carbon dioxide a much more potent greenhouse gas than it would be on a planet without water vapor.\u201d\nIncreases in atmospheric water vapor also amplify the global water cycle. They contribute to making wet regions wetter and dry regions drier. The more water vapor that air contains, the more energy it holds. This energy fuels intense storms, particularly over land. This results in more extreme weather events.\nBut more evaporation from the land also dries soils out. When water from intense storms falls on hard, dry ground, it runs off into rivers and streams instead of dampening soils.

The logistics of a large-scale geoengineering effort would be daunting, the experts said, but the cost would be small relative to climate action \u2013 billions of dollars a year against trillions.\nThe researchers emphasised that geoengineering only masked the symptoms of the climate crisis, and did not tackle the root cause \u2013 the burning of fossil fuels. Geoengineering could only complement the cutting of emissions, not replace it, they said.\nThe report considers the two types of geoengineering seen as most likely to be feasible and effective. Using high-altitude aircraft to pump sulphur dioxide (SO2) into the stratosphere would cause reflective particles to form, bouncing a fraction of the sun\u2019s heat back into space.\nExplosive volcanic eruptions are natural examples of this process, and studying these has helped researchers understand the impact. For example, the eruption of Mount Pinatubo, in the Philippines, in 1992, which pumped 15m tonnes of SO2 into the atmosphere, lowered global temperature by about 0.5C for a couple of years. About 8m to 16m tonnes a year is thought to be needed for a significant geoengineering programme.\nThis article was amended on 5 November 2025.

Only use 911 for life-threatening emergencies so the lines remain open for critical situations. Emergency response efforts & resources Emergency management crews are working with local officials in western North Carolina communities to assess damage and identify needs and find solutions. The State Emergency Operations Center is working around the clock to support locals and deliver supplies and aid. Supplying drinkable water is a top priority for emergency crews. Seven water plants in Avery, Burke, Haywood, Jackson, Rutherford, Watauga and Yancey counties are closed, impacting nearly 70,000 households. A total of 17 water plants have reported having no power, and an additional 23 are operating on backup power. There are 50 boil water advisories in effect across western communities. Information on how to safely boil water is available on the CDC website: How to Make Water Safe in an Emergency. The Governor has deployed the NC National Guard with 410 troops and 146 vehicles including high water vehicles to help with rescues, transport patients to medical care and deliver personnel and equipment to help with storm response. Approximately 630,000 customers in North Carolina remained without power Saturday afternoon with the bulk of them within Buncombe County. Fifteen shelters are currently open and housing approximately 500 people. (See ReadyNC.gov for latest) On Saturday Interstate 26 south of Asheville was opened but remains the only major thoroughfare into the region due to damage to Interstate 40 and other routes. State transportation officials continue to urge people to avoid travel anywhere in western North Carolina as about 390 roads and dozens of main highways remain closed Saturday due to flooding, downed trees, landslides or storm damage. The N.C. Department of Transportation is prioritizing work to reopen interstates, U.S. and state highways before getting to secondary routes, but the department also is working with utility companies and local emergency officials to find alternative routes and to assist in maintaining access to shelters and restoring power. State officials report that while many of the rivers and tributaries are still far above flood stage, waters are receding and most are expected to be back to near-normal levels by late Monday.

The logistics of a large-scale geoengineering effort would be daunting, the experts said, but the cost would be small relative to climate action \u2013 billions of dollars a year against trillions.\nThe researchers emphasised that geoengineering only masked the symptoms of the climate crisis, and did not tackle the root cause \u2013 the burning of fossil fuels. Geoengineering could only complement the cutting of emissions, not replace it, they said.\nThe report considers the two types of geoengineering seen as most likely to be feasible and effective. Using high-altitude aircraft to pump sulphur dioxide (SO2) into the stratosphere would cause reflective particles to form, bouncing a fraction of the sun\u2019s heat back into space.\nExplosive volcanic eruptions are natural examples of this process, and studying these has helped researchers understand the impact. For example, the eruption of Mount Pinatubo, in the Philippines, in 1992, which pumped 15m tonnes of SO2 into the atmosphere, lowered global temperature by about 0.5C for a couple of years. About 8m to 16m tonnes a year is thought to be needed for a significant geoengineering programme.\nThis article was amended on 5 November 2025.

However, what you see on your television, computer, and mobile device are digital representations of the data these satellites capture, not actual photographs or videos. So how are these images created?\nHow Satellites \u201cSee\u201d Earth\nSatellite imagers use remote sensing to collect information about Earth from above. GOES-R Series satellites carry an instrument called the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI), which measures energy at different wavelengths along the electromagnetic spectrum. The electromagnetic spectrum is the entire range of light that exists, from radio waves to gamma rays. Different objects absorb or reflect different wavelengths of light. ABI measures visible and infrared energy in 16 spectral bands, or channels.\nRather than capture an instant snapshot of the full Earth scene below the satellite, ABI scans \u201cswaths\u201d of Earth using two scan mirrors, one that moves from north to south and the other from east to west. After each east-west scan is complete, the north-south scan mirror moves to a new location to begin a new east-west scan. Twenty-two of these scans create a full disk (the entire scene that ABI can see).\nMeasuring Energy\nEach of ABI\u2019s 16 channels measures the amount of reflected or emitted energy in a specific wavelength of light along the electromagnetic spectrum to obtain information about Earth\u2019s atmosphere, land or ocean. ABI\u2019s spectral bands include two visible channels, four near-infrared channels, and ten infrared channels. ABI\u2019s visible channels only see during the daytime, much like our own eyes, because they only capture sunlight reflected off the earth. In contrast, ABI\u2019s infrared channels detect energy that is not visible to the human eye. The infrared channels collect energy that is emitted by objects such as the surface of the earth and clouds. ABI can detect infrared energy day or night. Think of ABI as acting like night vision goggles, which use image enhancement technology to see all available light. Each ABI channel is useful for viewing a particular feature, such as cloud type, water vapor in the atmosphere, ozone, carbon dioxide, or areas of ice or snow.\nABI collects particles of light called photons. When photons strike ABI detectors, they generate an electrical charge in the detector that is proportional to the amount of incoming light. The ABI electronics read the value of the electrical charge and convert it to a digital signal. The ABI detectors are similar to those used in a smartphone or digital camera, but they are much more sensitive because they need to detect very small signals coming from far away.\nTranslating Satellite Data\nInformation from ABI is turned into radio waves and is transmitted to antennas on the ground. The information is then sent to computers at a satellite data processing center. This information is transmitted in binary code , a numeric language that uses only two digits: 0 and 1, arranged in eight-character strings that are understandable by computer software. A numeric value of the amount of light detected by each object is digitally recorded. The computer then translates the information into imagery.\nSatellite imagery, like pictures on television, is made up of tiny squares called pixels (short for picture elements). Each pixel in satellite imagery represents the relative reflected or emitted light energy recorded for that part of the image. The binary code information transmitted from the satellite assigns a value to each segment of the electromagnetic spectrum. These numbers can be converted to grayscale (each pixel in an image represents only an amount of light, and is composed exclusively of shades of gray) to produce a black and white image in pixel form.\nCreating Color\nScientists can assign colors to the \u201cbands\u201d of ABI data based on what color of light they represent on the electromagnetic spectrum. To build a composite image from satellite data that makes sense to the human eye, we need to use colors from the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum \u2013 red, green and blue. These three primary colors can be combined at different intensities to form all possible colors. The color red is assigned to the band that represents red light, and blue to the band of data that represents blue light. ABI does not have a true \u201cgreen\u201d band, so this information is simulated using a lookup table that was created using data from the Japan Meteorological Agency\u2019s Advanced Himawari Imager, which is very similar to the ABI but contains a \u201cgreen\u201d channel.\nMultispectral Imagery\nCombining data from multiple ABI channels provides even more information. Certain combinations of data from different channels allow us to highlight features of interest. When combined in a particular \u201crecipe\u201d a single image is created, with the colors combining to form all the possible colors perceivable by human vision. The result is a variety of red-green-blue or \u201cRGB\u201d composite imagery , which can highlight atmospheric and surface features that are difficult or more time-consuming to distinguish from single-channel images alone. RGBs provide critical information that gives forecasters situational awareness and helps them understand rapidly changing weather. Often, geographical details like country and state boundaries are added to imagery to help orient the viewer.\n\u201cBy analyzing RGB composite imagery, forecasters can diagnose atmospheric features and processes that are not as readily apparent in the single-band imagery alone,\u201d explained NOAA physical scientist Bill Line. \u201cFurther, a single RGB product may allow for the interpretation of multiple phenomena that would otherwise require the use of several imagery channels or products. The RGB imagery, therefore, allows forecasters to produce more accurate and timely forecasts and warnings for the public,\u201d he said. \u201cA few features that are more e\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Each pixel in satellite imagery represents the relative reflected or emitted light energy recorded for that part of the image. The binary code information transmitted from the satellite assigns a value to each segment of the electromagnetic spectrum. These numbers can be converted to grayscale (each pixel in an image represents only an amount of light, and is composed exclusively of shades of gray) to produce a black and white image in pixel form.\nCreating Color\nScientists can assign colors to the \u201cbands\u201d of ABI data based on what color of light they represent on the electromagnetic spectrum. To build a composite image from satellite data that makes sense to the human eye, we need to use colors from the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum \u2013 red, green and blue. These three primary colors can be combined at different intensities to form all possible colors. The color red is assigned to the band that represents red light, and blue to the band of data that represents blue light. ABI does not have a true \u201cgreen\u201d band, so this information is simulated using a lookup table that was created using data from the Japan Meteorological Agency\u2019s Advanced Himawari Imager, which is very similar to the ABI but contains a \u201cgreen\u201d channel.\nMultispectral Imagery\nCombining data from multiple ABI channels provides even more information. Certain combinations of data from different channels allow us to highlight features of interest. When combined in a particular \u201crecipe\u201d a single image is created, with the colors combining to form all the possible colors perceivable by human vision. The result is a variety of red-green-blue or \u201cRGB\u201d composite imagery , which can highlight atmospheric and surface features that are difficult or more time-consuming to distinguish from single-channel images alone. RGBs provide critical information that gives forecasters situational awareness and helps them understand rapidly changing weather. Often, geographical details like country and state boundaries are added to imagery to help orient the viewer.\n\u201cBy analyzing RGB composite imagery, forecasters can diagnose atmospheric features and processes that are not as readily apparent in the single-band imagery alone,\u201d explained NOAA physical scientist Bill Line. \u201cFurther, a single RGB product may allow for the interpretation of multiple phenomena that would otherwise require the use of several imagery channels or products. The RGB imagery, therefore, allows forecasters to produce more accurate and timely forecasts and warnings for the public,\u201d he said. \u201cA few features that are more e\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Two types of geoengineering activities that have been proposed are: carbon dioxide (CO2) removal (CDR), which removes CO2 from the atmosphere, and solar radiation management (SRM, or sunlight reflection methods), which reflects a small percentage of sunlight back into space to offset warming from greenhouse gases (GHGs). Current research suggests that SRM or CDR might diminish the impacts of climate change on ecosystems by reducing changes in temperature and precipitation. However, sudden cessation of SRM would exacerbate the climate effects on ecosystems, and some CDR might interfere with oceanic and terrestrial ecosystem processes. The many risks and uncertainties associated with these new kinds of purposeful perturbations to the Earth system are not well understood and require cautious and comprehensive research.\nKeywords: Geoengineering, Ecosystems, Climate change, Carbon dioxide removal, Solar radiation management\nAs anthropogenic emissions of GHG rise and their concentrations in the atmosphere continue to increase, there is growing discussion about the need to evaluate \u201cgeoengineering\u201d methods to reduce the greenhouse effects on the climate and environment (Shepherd et al. 2009). Geoengineering can be defined as the deliberate manipulation of features of the Earth system to reduce the magnitude and rate of changes in the physical climate system that are attributed to this accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs; IPCC 2007a). While there has now been much general discussion of the different means by which geoengineering may be accomplished and some speculation about the research strategies by which their effectiveness could be determined (Shepherd et al. 2009), there has been relatively little discussion of research needed to understand their potential for affecting ecosystems. Yet many geoengineering activities could significantly impact both natural and managed ecosystems and their functions. This is important because ecosystems, including those within forests, oceans, grasslands, and wetlands, provide both innate value and our life support systems, including numerous essential goods and services (MEA 2005). This study focuses on research needs related to identifying and quantifying potential ecosystem consequences of proposed geoengineering methods. Ecosystem impacts form a subset of a much broader range of pertinent social and physical science research questions, including issues of governance and ethics, all of which should be addressed before any proposed geoengineering method could be considered as a viable policy option.\nIn this report, we follow the Royal Society (Shepherd et al. 2009) in referring to two different sets of activities: carbon dioxide removal (CDR) methods, including a range of engineered and biological processes to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, and solar radiation management (SRM or sunlight reflection) methods, typically involving reflecting a small percentage of solar light and heat back into space to offset the warming due to GHGs. CDR and SRM techniques are fundamentally different in the timescales over which the interventions would operate (Lenton and Vaughan 2009; Shepherd et al. 2009). The scale-up of a CDR deployment to the point where it would have significant climate effects would be slow (likely decades for a substantial drawdown of CO2), but with long lasting effects. In contrast, SRM could provide rapid cooling (in months) but would require continual renewal. Of these two types of methods, only CDR would address the CO2 concentrations responsible for both climate change as well as other CO2-induced ecosystem effects such as ocean acidification.\nThe Earth\u2019s temperature and climate are fundamentally controlled by its energy balance, which drives and maintains the climate system. This balance consists of incoming energy from the Sun (including ultra violet, visible, and infrared) and outgoing heat (thermal infrared) radiation. These energy streams do not reach or leave Earth\u2019s surface unimpeded. On average, about one third of the incoming sunlight radiation is reflected by clouds and aerosols, ice caps, and bright surfaces. This fraction that is reflected is referred to as its \u201calbedo\u201d. Most incoming energy passes through the atmosphere to reach Earth\u2019s surface; the part not reflected by the albedo is absorbed and so warms the surface. The absorbed energy is transferred to the atmosphere by emitted surface radiation, evaporative cooling, and direct thermal motion. Some outgoing thermal energy then emitted by Earth\u2019s surface is absorbed by GHGs in the atmosphere (mainly by water vapor and CO2) and also by clouds, thus reducing the amount of heat radiation escaping to space and warming the atmosphere and Earth\u2019s surface. This is known as the greenhouse effect. On average, only about 60% of the radiation emitted at the surface leaves the atmosphere, after absorption and emission within the atmosphere. Increased atmospheric CO2 is not only responsible for temperature changes, but for other consequences to the Earth system. In addition, increased CO2 absorbed by the ocean has a measurable effect on ocean acidity, with consequent impacts on ocean biogeochemistry and biodiversity.\nCDR methods are designed to remove CO2 from the atmosphere and transfer it to long-lived carbon reservoirs. They include:\nLand use management to protect or enhance terrestrial carbon sinks;\nUsing biomass for carbon sequestration as well as (or instead of) a carbon neutral energy source;\nAccelerating natural geological processes that remove CO2 from the atmosphere (e.g., \u201cenhanced weathering\u201d);\nDirect engineered capture of CO2 from ambient air (i.e., collection and removal of CO2 from the atmosphere to storage reservoirs that are isolated from the atm\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

But excess water drowned a community, which could put Duke in hot water.\n\nFull Page Content:\nCarolina Public Press\nCarolina Public Press provides in-depth, investigative reporting on issues affecting North Carolina in a nonprofit, nonpartisan setting.\nScores of waterfront property owners in Mecklenburg County are slowly moving forward with government programs to acquire or elevate their homes almost four months after Tropical Storm Helene, and later Duke Energy, upended their lives.\nDespite Charlotte being more than 100 miles away from the storm\u2019s center, Helene dumped enough water into the Catawba River last September to overfill the chain of man-made lakes maintained by the utility company.\nWhen Norman, the largest of these lakes, couldn\u2019t hold any more excess water, Duke opened the floodgates on Cowan\u2019s Ford Dam.\nThe result was disastrous: Downstream communities were drenched.\nOn the Mecklenburg County side of the Catawba, floodwaters damaged about 170 structures. Those waters crested nearly eight feet high on Mountain Island Lake, which sits directly below Lake Norman and provides the majority of Charlotte\u2019s drinking water.\nAlso affected were at least six structures in Gaston County.\nIn late October, Duke filed an incident report with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, focusing mostly on the damage and needed repairs to its own hydropower facilities.\nAccording to the report, Duke \u201cstayed in direct contact with county emergency management agencies and provided real-time information regarding current conditions and anticipated reservoir levels. \u2026 Duke Energy personnel disconnected power to certain homes and in some cases, to entire streets as directed by emergency management authorities and later reconnected them as directed.\u201d\nHowever, nowhere in that report did the utility mention the property damage in Mecklenburg and Gaston counties following the decision to open the floodgates.\nAround the same time, flood victim Erik Jendresen submitted a letter to the commission urging the agency to further examine Duke\u2019s actions in the week leading up to Helene.\n\u201cWhy, in advance of what proved to be one of the most accurately forecast meteorological events in recent memory, did Duke Energy not commence immediately to lower the levels of each and every one of the 11 lakes that comprise the Catawba-Wateree River Basin,\u201d according to Jendresen\u2019s letter.\nHowever, the commission issued a letter to Duke on Jan. 14 accepting the utility\u2019s explanation on how the incident was handled, presumably ending federal inquiry into the matter.\nDuke Energy spokesman Ben Williamson confirmed on Tuesday that the commission isn\u2019t requesting any additional information regarding the company\u2019s dam operations or communications during the storm.\nBut while the federal government appears satisfied, residents along the Catawba are a different story.\nMountain Island Lake\u2019s tight-knit community has been here before. A group of residents sued and later settled with the utility after a similar event in 2019.\nNow, some of those same people are in a waiting game to see what will happen with their homes.\nFlood victims told Carolina Public Press that they believe Duke Energy was once again not proactive enough in moving water through the system ahead of the storm, which could have significantly reduced the severity of the flood.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really failed here is the trust,\u201d resident Gidget Dennehy said. \u201cUnfortunately, because Duke doesn\u2019t have the integrity to step up to this community and to acknowledge wrongdoing, it\u2019s the government that steps in \u2026 People look to them and blame them when we should be blaming Duke.\u201d\nTwo programs are available to Mecklenburg residents for home buyouts or elevations in the aftermath of the Duke Energy controversy.\nA county-run program has drawn a number of takers. According to Jonathan Beller, a flood mitigation specialist at Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services, 45 property owners have expressed interest in a buyout.\nBeller also said 15 property owners have expressed interest in the county\u2019s retroFIT program, which would cover the cost of either a home elevation or demolition.\nMeanwhile, the state administers its own buyout, elevation and reconstruction programs using federal dollars from FEMA\u2019s Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. Mecklenburg County property owners have submitted 61 buyout applications, 38 elevation applications, two land stabilization requests and one mitigation reconstruction application, said Justin Graney, a spokesman for North Carolina Emergency Management.\nThat\u2019s one source of monetary relief flood victims are banking on. But there could be another.\nResidents have yet to file any lawsuits against Duke \u2014 like they did in 2019 \u2014 although that may still happen.\nDavid Spence, a professor at the University of Texas who specializes in regulation of renewable energy, told CPP that a potential civil action would need to surmount a high bar in order to prove that Duke Energy acted outside the scope of its federally regulated behavior.\nFurthermore, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\u2019s acceptance of Duke Energy\u2019s explanation about the incident would make it difficult for a civil action alleging negligence, according to Spence.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t argue that it\u2019s a nuisance if it\u2019s a federally permitted and specified activity,\u201d he explained. \u201cNow, if it\u2019s negligent, if they\u2019re not following their regulatory mandates, then perhaps you do have consequences.\u201d\nRepublish This Story\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.

This water vapor helps fuel the development of storms, ...\n\nFull Page Content:\n5 MIN READ\nWater vapor is Earth\u2019s most abundant greenhouse gas. It\u2019s responsible for about half of Earth\u2019s greenhouse effect \u2014 the process that occurs when gases in Earth\u2019s atmosphere trap the Sun\u2019s heat. Greenhouse gases keep our planet livable. Without them, Earth\u2019s surface temperature would be about 59 degrees Fahrenheit (33 degrees Celsius) colder. Water vapor is also a key part of Earth\u2019s water cycle: the path that all water follows as it moves around Earth\u2019s atmosphere, land, and ocean as liquid water, solid ice, and gaseous water vapor.\nSince the late 1800s, global average surface temperatures have increased by about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius). Data from satellites, weather balloons, and ground measurements confirm the amount of atmospheric water vapor is increasing as the climate warms. (The United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report states total atmospheric water vapor is increasing 1 to 2% per decade.) For every degree Celsius that Earth\u2019s atmospheric temperature rises, the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere can increase by about 7%, according to the laws of thermodynamics.\nSome people mistakenly believe water vapor is the main driver of Earth\u2019s current warming. But increased water vapor doesn\u2019t cause global warming. Instead, it\u2019s a consequence of it. Increased water vapor in the atmosphere amplifies the warming caused by other greenhouse gases.\nIt works like this: As greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane increase, Earth\u2019s temperature rises in response. This increases evaporation from both water and land areas. Because warmer air holds more moisture, its concentration of water vapor increases. Specifically, this happens because water vapor does not condense and precipitate out of the atmosphere as easily at higher temperatures. The water vapor then absorbs heat radiated from Earth and prevents it from escaping out to space. This further warms the atmosphere, resulting in even more water vapor in the atmosphere. This is what scientists call a \"positive feedback loop.\" Scientists estimate this effect more than doubles the warming that would happen due to increasing carbon dioxide alone.\nThe greenhouse gases in the dry air in Earth\u2019s atmosphere include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, and chlorofluorocarbons. While making up around 0.05% of Earth\u2019s total atmosphere, they play major roles in trapping Earth\u2019s radiant heat from the Sun and keeping it from escaping into space. Each is driven directly by human activities.\nAll five of these greenhouse gases are non-condensable. Non-condensable gases can\u2019t be changed into liquid at the very cold temperatures present at the top of Earth\u2019s troposphere, where it meets the stratosphere. As atmospheric temperatures change, the concentration of non-condensable gases remains stable.\nBut water vapor is a different animal. It\u2019s condensable \u2013 it can be changed from a gas into a liquid. Its concentration depends on the temperature of the atmosphere. This makes water vapor the only greenhouse gas whose concentration increases because the atmosphere is warming, and causes it to warm even more.\nIf non-condensable gases weren\u2019t increasing, the amount of atmospheric water vapor would be unchanged from its pre-industrial revolution levels.\nCarbon dioxide is responsible for a third of the total warming of Earth\u2019s climate due to human-produced greenhouse gases. Small increases in its concentration have major effects. A key reason is the length of time carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere.\nMethane, carbon dioxide, and chlorofluorocarbons don\u2019t condense, and they aren\u2019t particularly chemically reactive or easily broken down by light in the troposphere. For these reasons, they remain in the atmosphere for anywhere from years to centuries or even longer, depending on the gas.\nIn contrast, a molecule of water vapor stays in the atmosphere just nine days, on average. It then gets recycled as rain or snow. Its amounts don\u2019t accumulate, despite its much larger relative quantities.\n\u201cCarbon dioxide and other non-condensable greenhouse gases act as control knobs for the climate,\u201d said Andrew Dessler, a professor of Atmospheric Sciences at Texas A&M University in College Station. \u201cAs humans add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, small changes in climate are amplified by changes in water vapor. This makes carbon dioxide a much more potent greenhouse gas than it would be on a planet without water vapor.\u201d\nIncreases in atmospheric water vapor also amplify the global water cycle. They contribute to making wet regions wetter and dry regions drier. The more water vapor that air contains, the more energy it holds. This energy fuels intense storms, particularly over land. This results in more extreme weather events.\nBut more evaporation from the land also dries soils out. When water from intense storms falls on hard, dry ground, it runs off into rivers and streams instead of dampening soils. This increases the risk of drought.\nIn short, when atmospheric water vapor meets increased levels of other greenhouse gases, its impacts on Earth\u2019s climate are substantial.\nFrom Alaska\u2019s Saint Elias Mountains to Pakistan\u2019s Karakoram, glaciers speed up and slow down with\u2026\nThis year, the ozone hole over Antarctica reached its annual maximum extent on Sept. 9th,\u2026\nThe ozone hole over the Antarctic was small in 2025 compared to previous years and\u2026\nExplore Earth Science\nNASA's unique vantage point helps us inform solutions to enhance decision-making, improve livelihoods, and protect our planet.\nEarth Science Data\nFacts About Earth\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

An unintended test of geoengineering is ...\n\nGoogle Search Snippet:\nThe dramatic decline in ship tracks is clear evidence that humanity could cool off the planet significantly by brightening the clouds.\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nGOES-16 and GOES-17, also known as GOES-East and GOES-West respectively, provide beautiful images of Earth. However, what you see on your television, computer, and mobile device are digital representations of the data these satellites capture, not actual photographs or videos. So how are these images created?\nHow Satellites \u201cSee\u201d Earth\nSatellite imagers use remote sensing to collect information about Earth from above. GOES-R Series satellites carry an instrument called the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI), which measures energy at different wavelengths along the electromagnetic spectrum. The electromagnetic spectrum is the entire range of light that exists, from radio waves to gamma rays. Different objects absorb or reflect different wavelengths of light. ABI measures visible and infrared energy in 16 spectral bands, or channels.\nRather than capture an instant snapshot of the full Earth scene below the satellite, ABI scans \u201cswaths\u201d of Earth using two scan mirrors, one that moves from north to south and the other from east to west. After each east-west scan is complete, the north-south scan mirror moves to a new location to begin a new east-west scan. Twenty-two of these scans create a full disk (the entire scene that ABI can see).\nMeasuring Energy\nEach of ABI\u2019s 16 channels measures the amount of reflected or emitted energy in a specific wavelength of light along the electromagnetic spectrum to obtain information about Earth\u2019s atmosphere, land or ocean. ABI\u2019s spectral bands include two visible channels, four near-infrared channels, and ten infrared channels. ABI\u2019s visible channels only see during the daytime, much like our own eyes, because they only capture sunlight reflected off the earth. In contrast, ABI\u2019s infrared channels detect energy that is not visible to the human eye. The infrared channels collect energy that is emitted by objects such as the surface of the earth and clouds. ABI can detect infrared energy day or night. Think of ABI as acting like night vision goggles, which use image enhancement technology to see all available light. Each ABI channel is useful for viewing a particular feature, such as cloud type, water vapor in the atmosphere, ozone, carbon dioxide, or areas of ice or snow.\nABI collects particles of light called photons. When photons strike ABI detectors, they generate an electrical charge in the detector that is proportional to the amount of incoming light. The ABI electronics read the value of the electrical charge and convert it to a digital signal. The ABI detectors are similar to those used in a smartphone or digital camera, but they are much more sensitive because they need to detect very small signals coming from far away.\nTranslating Satellite Data\nInformation from ABI is turned into radio waves and is transmitted to antennas on the ground. The information is then sent to computers at a satellite data processing center. This information is transmitted in binary code , a numeric language that uses only two digits: 0 and 1, arranged in eight-character strings that are understandable by computer software. A numeric value of the amount of light detected by each object is digitally recorded. The computer then translates the information into imagery.\nSatellite imagery, like pictures on television, is made up of tiny squares called pixels (short for picture elements). Each pixel in satellite imagery represents the relative reflected or emitted light energy recorded for that part of the image. The binary code information transmitted from the satellite assigns a value to each segment of the electromagnetic spectrum. These numbers can be converted to grayscale (each pixel in an image represents only an amount of light, and is composed exclusively of shades of gray) to produce a black and white image in pixel form.\nCreating Color\nScientists can assign colors to the \u201cbands\u201d of ABI data based on what color of light they represent on the electromagnetic spectrum. To build a composite image from satellite data that makes sense to the human eye, we need to use colors from the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum \u2013 red, green and blue. These three primary colors can be combined at different intensities to form all possible colors. The color red is assigned to the band that represents red light, and blue to the band of data that represents blue light. ABI does not have a true \u201cgreen\u201d band, so this information is simulated using a lookup table that was created using data from the Japan Meteorological Agency\u2019s Advanced Himawari Imager, which is very similar to the ABI but contains a \u201cgreen\u201d channel.\nMultispectral Imagery\nCombining data from multiple ABI channels provides even more information. Certain combinations of data from different channels allow us to highlight features of interest. When combined in a particular \u201crecipe\u201d a single image is created, with the colors combining to form all the possible colors perceivable by human vision. The result is a variety of red-green-blue or \u201cRGB\u201d composite imagery , which can highlight atmospheric and surface features that are difficult or more time-consuming to distinguish from single-channel images alone. RGBs provide critical information that gives forecasters situational awareness and helps them understand rapidly changing weather. Often, geographical details like country and state boundaries are added to imagery to help orient the viewer.\n\u201cBy analyzing RGB composite imagery, forecasters can diagnose atmospheric features and processes that are not as readily apparent in the single-band imagery alone,\u201d explained NOAA physical scientist Bill Line. \u201cFurther, a single RGB product may allow for the interpretation of multiple phenomena that would otherwise require the use of several imagery channels or products. The RGB imagery, therefore, allows forecasters to produce more accurate and timely forecasts and warnings for the public,\u201d he said. \u201cA few features that are more e\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Governor Cooper has urged communications providers including cell phone carriers and utilities to restore service as quickly as possible. North Carolina\u2019s emergency management and transportation workers are pushing to open roads and rush supplies as quickly as possible. Utilities and communications are returning in some areas, but it may be days before service is fully restored. Meanwhile, North Carolina residents trying to connect with family members may call NC 211 (or 1-888-892-1162 if calling from outside the state) to report missing loved ones. People in the impacted areas can indicate they are safe by checking in on Facebook crisis response or reporting themselves safe through Red Cross Reunification by calling 1-800- ED-CROSS (1-800-733-2767). Only use 911 for life-threatening emergencies so the lines remain open for critical situations. Emergency response efforts & resources Emergency management crews are working with local officials in western North Carolina communities to assess damage and identify needs and find solutions. The State Emergency Operations Center is working around the clock to support locals and deliver supplies and aid. Supplying drinkable water is a top priority for emergency crews. Seven water plants in Avery, Burke, Haywood, Jackson, Rutherford, Watauga and Yancey counties are closed, impacting nearly 70,000 households. A total of 17 water plants have reported having no power, and an additional 23 are operating on backup power. There are 50 boil water advisories in effect across western communities. Information on how to safely boil water is available on the CDC website: How to Make Water Safe in an Emergency. The Governor has deployed the NC National Guard with 410 troops and 146 vehicles including high water vehicles to help with rescues, transport patients to medical care and deliver personnel and equipment to help with storm response. Approximately 630,000 customers in North Carolina remained without power Saturday afternoon with the bulk of them within Buncombe County. Fifteen shelters are currently open and housing approximately 500 people. (See ReadyNC.gov for latest) On Saturday Interstate 26 south of Asheville was opened but remains the only major thoroughfare into the region due to damage to Interstate 40 and other routes. State transportation officials continue to urge people to avoid travel anywhere in western North Carolina as about 390 roads and dozens of main highways remain closed Saturday due to flooding, downed trees, landslides or storm damage. The N.C. Department of Transportation is prioritizing work to reopen interstates, U.S. and state highways before getting to secondary routes, but the department also is working with utility companies and local emergency officials to find alternative routes and to assist in maintaining access to shelters and restoring power. State officials report that while many of the rivers and tributaries are still far above flood stage, waters are receding and most are expected to be back to near-normal levels by late Monday.

Traditional forecasts rely on ground-based radar systems, which are space-constrained and have high maintenance costs. Consequently, most developing countries depend on a global numerical model with low resolution, instead of operating their own radar systems. To mitigate this gap, we propose the Neural Precipitation Model (NPM), which uses global-scale geostationary satellite imagery. NPM predicts precipitation for up to six hours, with an update every hour. We take three key channels to discriminate rain clouds as input: infrared radiation (at a wavelength of 10.5 \u03bc \u2062 m ), upper- (6.3 \u03bc \u2062 m ), and lower- (7.3 \u03bc \u2062 m ) level water vapor channels. Additionally, NPM introduces positional encoders to capture seasonal and temporal patterns, accounting for variations in precipitation. Our experimental results demonstrate that NPM can predict rainfall in real-time with a resolution of 2 km. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/seominseok0429/Data-driven-Precipitation-Nowcasting-Using-Satellite-Imagery.\nAs global warming accelerates, the damage caused by natural disasters is on the rise. Particularly with increasing temperatures, the intensity of extreme precipitation events escalates (Ombadi et al. 2023), leading to significant human casualties due to disasters such as floods, landslides, and soil erosion. To mitigate the loss of life from these disasters, accurate and real-time precipitation forecasting is essential.\nTraditionally, precipitation forecasting relies on various observational equipment such as radar systems and numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. For instance, the HRRR model (Dowell et al. 2022) utilizes radar data, satellite data, surface observations, aircraft data, weather buoys and ships, model initialization data, and fire/smoke data to provide forecasts at a resolution of approximately 3 km. Additionally, global NWP models such as ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) (Hersbach et al. 2020) and integrated forecasting system (IFS) (Wedi et al. 2015) perform forecasts at a resolution of around 25 km.\nDespite advancements in the observational equipment and the NWP models, essential tools for precipitation forecasting involve installation and maintenance costs that can reach about billions of dollars. Furthermore, algorithms like IFS and ERA5 require supercomputers, making them challenging to operate in countries with limited budgets and resources.\nTo overcome these issues, numerous data-driven weather forecasting methods have been proposed. Pangu-Weather (Bi et al. 2023) and GraphCast (Lam et al. 2023) demonstrate superior performance compared to traditional NWP models like IFS, even when running in a single GPU environment. Similarly, a series of MetNet (Andrychowicz et al. 2023; S\u00f8nderby et al. 2020) shows high accuracy in precipitation forecasting while also operating efficiently on a single GPU. However, these global weather forecasting models still rely on NWP data for their initial conditions, meaning they have not fully eliminated the dependency on supercomputers. Additionally, with a resolution of 25 km, they remain insufficient for predicting localized heavy rainfall events, such as flash floods.\nThe MetNet series and various radar-to-radar benchmark (Veillette, Samsi, and Mattioli 2020) models take radar data as input, and produce radar-based outputs, making radar infrastructure essential. Moreover, radar-to-radar models are unable to detect developing precipitation types that do not appear in radar signals yet, further reducing their effectiveness in certain situations.\nTo address the challenges of supercomputer dependency, radar-only systems, and the difficulty of predicting precipitation without prior radar signals, we propose the real-time neural precipitation model (NPM). In addition, to train our NPM model, we introduce the Geostationary Satellite-to-Radar dataset, which is called Sat2Rdr. Our approach is inspired by traditional methods of predicting precipitation using atmospheric states and cloud characteristics from satellite imagery, which have historically relied on the correlation between cloud-top brightness temperature and surface rainfall rates (Arkin 1979; Sorooshian et al. 2000; Huffman et al. 2010). The dataset utilizes the Infrared (IR) channel at 10.5 \u03bc \u2062 m , the Water Vapor (WV) channel at 6.3 \u03bc \u2062 m , and the WV channel at 7.3 \u03bc \u2062 m \u2014channels closely linked to precipitation in traditional algorithms.\nOur NPM consists of two stages: The first stage predicts satellite images showing the formation and dissipation of clouds associated with precipitation. The second stage estimates rainfall from the predicted satellite images, accurately predicting rain rates by analyzing cloud type and growth stage through infrared and water vapor channels.\nSince the NPM relies solely on satellite imagery, it does not inherently predict seasonal or diurnal precipitation patterns. To overcome this, we incorporate day and hour positional embeddings into the NPM, allowing it to learn these patterns. As shown in Figure 1 from the Papua New Guinea flood case, NPM is capable of forecasting precipitation even in regions without radar coverage, as it uses only satellite imagery and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data as input.\nWe validate the effectiveness of our NPM using various video prediction models on the geostationa\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

It\u2019s responsible for about half of Earth\u2019s greenhouse effect \u2014 the process that occurs when gases in Earth\u2019s atmosphere trap the Sun\u2019s heat. Greenhouse gases keep our planet livable. Without them, Earth\u2019s surface temperature would be about 59 degrees Fahrenheit (33 degrees Celsius) colder. Water vapor is also a key part of Earth\u2019s water cycle: the path that all water follows as it moves around Earth\u2019s atmosphere, land, and ocean as liquid water, solid ice, and gaseous water vapor.\nSince the late 1800s, global average surface temperatures have increased by about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius). Data from satellites, weather balloons, and ground measurements confirm the amount of atmospheric water vapor is increasing as the climate warms. (The United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report states total atmospheric water vapor is increasing 1 to 2% per decade.) For every degree Celsius that Earth\u2019s atmospheric temperature rises, the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere can increase by about 7%, according to the laws of thermodynamics.\nSome people mistakenly believe water vapor is the main driver of Earth\u2019s current warming. But increased water vapor doesn\u2019t cause global warming. Instead, it\u2019s a consequence of it. Increased water vapor in the atmosphere amplifies the warming caused by other greenhouse gases.\nIt works like this: As greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane increase, Earth\u2019s temperature rises in response. This increases evaporation from both water and land areas. Because warmer air holds more moisture, its concentration of water vapor increases. Specifically, this happens because water vapor does not condense and precipitate out of the atmosphere as easily at higher temperatures. The water vapor then absorbs heat radiated from Earth and prevents it from escaping out to space. This further warms the atmosphere, resulting in even more water vapor in the atmosphere. This is what scientists call a \"positive feedback loop.\" Scientists estimate this effect more than doubles the warming that would happen due to increasing carbon dioxide alone.\nThe greenhouse gases in the dry air in Earth\u2019s atmosphere include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, and chlorofluorocarbons. While making up around 0.05% of Earth\u2019s total atmosphere, they play major roles in trapping Earth\u2019s radiant heat from the Sun and keeping it from escaping into space. Each is driven directly by human activities.\nAll five of these greenhouse gases are non-condensable. Non-condensable gases can\u2019t be changed into liquid at the very cold temperatures present at the top of Earth\u2019s troposphere, where it meets the stratosphere. As atmospheric temperatures change, the concentration of non-condensable gases remains stable.\nBut water vapor is a different animal. It\u2019s condensable \u2013 it can be changed from a gas into a liquid. Its concentration depends on the temperature of the atmosphere. This makes water vapor the only greenhouse gas whose concentration increases because the atmosphere is warming, and causes it to warm even more.\nIf non-condensable gases weren\u2019t increasing, the amount of atmospheric water vapor would be unchanged from its pre-industrial revolution levels.\nCarbon dioxide is responsible for a third of the total warming of Earth\u2019s climate due to human-produced greenhouse gases. Small increases in its concentration have major effects. A key reason is the length of time carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere.\nMethane, carbon dioxide, and chlorofluorocarbons don\u2019t condense, and they aren\u2019t particularly chemically reactive or easily broken down by light in the troposphere. For these reasons, they remain in the atmosphere for anywhere from years to centuries or even longer, depending on the gas.\nIn contrast, a molecule of water vapor stays in the atmosphere just nine days, on average. It then gets recycled as rain or snow. Its amounts don\u2019t accumulate, despite its much larger relative quantities.\n\u201cCarbon dioxide and other non-condensable greenhouse gases act as control knobs for the climate,\u201d said Andrew Dessler, a professor of Atmospheric Sciences at Texas A&M University in College Station. \u201cAs humans add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, small changes in climate are amplified by changes in water vapor. This makes carbon dioxide a much more potent greenhouse gas than it would be on a planet without water vapor.\u201d\nIncreases in atmospheric water vapor also amplify the global water cycle. They contribute to making wet regions wetter and dry regions drier. The more water vapor that air contains, the more energy it holds. This energy fuels intense storms, particularly over land. This results in more extreme weather events.\nBut more evaporation from the land also dries soils out. When water from intense storms falls on hard, dry ground, it runs off into rivers and streams instead of dampening soils. This increases the risk of drought.\nIn short, when atmospheric water vapor meets increased levels of other greenhouse gases, its impacts on Earth\u2019s climate are substantial.\nFrom Alaska\u2019s Saint Elias Mountains to Pakistan\u2019s Karakoram, glaciers speed up and slow down with\u2026\nThis year, the ozone hole over Antarctica reached its annual maximum extent on Sept. 9th,\u2026\nThe ozone hole over the Antarctic was small in 2025 compared to previous years and\u2026\nExplore Earth Science\nNASA's unique vantage point helps us inform solutions to enhance decision-making, improve livelihoods, and protect our planet.\nEarth Science Data\nFacts About Earth\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Delayed actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are projected to have irreversible effects on Earth's system and weather events with dire consequences for society and ecosystems. Geoengineering could be an opportunity to mitigate the worst impacts until emission and greenhouse gas concentration reductions have been effective. In particular, approaches that globally reflect sunlight have a large potential to reduce global temperatures based on recent model studies. At this time, however, it is not known if geoengineering is a viable solution, and a lot of work is needed to understand potential benefits, side effects, and risks of different approaches, in order to appropriately inform society and stakeholders.\nThe full effect of global geoengineering can only be tested using computer models. Comprehensive Earth System Models are required that represent the most important processes essential to simulate different potential geoengineering proposals. In recent years NCAR's state-of-the-art Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) has been developed to include interactive coupling between aerosols, chemistry, radiation, and environment. A WACCM model study performed simulations over the period of the recent largest volcanic eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in 1991, and demonstrated excellent agreement with observations in terms of aerosol movement, radiative changes, and chemical response (see Figure). Current and future developments of ACOM models are essential to provide the community with important tools for geoengineering research.\nProject Team: Simone Tilmes [tilmes@ucar.edu], Jadwiga H. Richter [jrichter@ucar.edu], Michael Mills [mmills@ucar.edu], Ben Kravitz [Ben.Kravitz@pnnl.gov], and Douglas G.

Simulations were performed in 2017 on the new NCAR Cheyenne supercomputer, using the Advanced Science Discovery allocations. A comprehensive set of model output has been made available to the community on the NCAR Climate Data Gateway. This enables the community to explore the effects of solar geoengineering on the Earth system based on a multiple ensemble dataset. So far 3 papers have been published using this dataset and several additional papers are in preparation by colleagues at NCAR, US universities, and international universities, including in the UK and the Netherlands. Researchers are looking at various aspects including detection of Earth system responses, effects on hurricanes, water cycle, aerosols etc. GLENS is a joint project between ACOM and CGD.\nACOM is participating in the DECIMALS project in collaborating with 8 groups from different developing countries to explore the impacts of Solar Radiation Management (SRM) on their regions.

NASA's AIRS instrument provides information about ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAs autumn arrives, the peak of Atlantic hurricane season is upon us, and the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere plays a major role in the strength of tropical cyclones. To quantify water vapor, meteorologists use the term \u201cprecipitable water vapor\u201d (PWV) to describe the amount of water vapor contained in a column of air extending from the surface to the top of the atmosphere.\nThe most intuitive way to think about PWV is to imagine a wet towel that represents the water vapor in the atmosphere and then picture that wet towel as it is completely wrung out into a glass. The volume of the water in that glass would be the total amount of PWV, as if that water vapor had precipitated from the atmosphere to the ground. Total column water vapor (TCWV) is technically the correct term to describe this measurement; however, in practice, PWV and TCWV are used interchangeably since the total amount of PWV over an area is normally the quantity forecasters are interested in.\nMeasuring PWV normally requires the use of radiosondes, which are launched by NASA, weather organizations, and meteorological offices around the world. These instruments measure the atmospheric humidity (in addition to many other variables) at different levels of the atmosphere, creating a sounding, or vertical profile, of the atmosphere. The sounding of atmospheric humidity can then be used to compute PWV.\nThough radiosondes are reliable, the spatial coverage (a single point) and temporal coverage (twice daily) leaves many gaps in the data around the world, especially over the oceans (NOAA, 2014). Instruments such as NASA\u2019s Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) have the capability to produce soundings worldwide twice a day (NASA, 2021). AIRS soundings have helped to provide PWV measurements worldwide for over two decades (Figure 1), filling in gaps to complement radiosonde measurements and providing vital information to weather models.\nFigure 1. Monthly Average Daily TCWV from AIRS for July 2025 (image produced with NASA\u2019s Giovanni). Values are shaded according to the color palette values displayed on the right in kilograms per meter squared (kg/m2) or millimeters. 1 kg/m2 of water is equal to the depth of 1 mm of water over a square meter. Credit: GES DISC\nAreas of high PWV alert forecasters to the potential for heavy precipitation rates and flash flooding. Tropical cyclones are fueled by the condensation of moisture, and areas of high PWV provide ample amounts, enabling the storms to rapidly strengthen and produce extremely heavy rain and wind.\nHigh sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are also widely known to strengthen tropical cyclones. This, however, is only half the story. Water evaporation increases in areas of high SSTs. The additional water vapor provided to the lower atmosphere from the ocean surface is then wrapped around into the cyclone (Figure 2), causing the storm to strengthen and, in some cases, rapidly intensify.\nFigure 2. Schematic of the air flow inside and surrounding a tropical cyclone. Credit: NASA SpacePlace\nPWV is commonly reported as the total column value, but as previously mentioned, the link between SSTs and tropical cyclones is the water vapor evaporated from the ocean surface. Therefore, the lower-level PWV, and not the TCWV (in some cases), may be more representative of the moisture fueling a tropical cyclone.\nNASA instruments such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS) aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites provide lower-atmosphere PWV products such as MOD08_D3 and MY08_D3, which provide measurements from the surface to 680 millibars. These data are useful in quantifying the lower-level moisture, though users are limited to investigating a predetermined atmospheric layer depth.\nThe AIRS instrument provides soundings of water vapor mixing ratio (WVMR), which represents the ratio of the mass of water vapor to dry air, typically expressed in grams per kilogram (g/kg). WVMR is computed using variables such as dewpoint temperature and pressure. These variables are simpler to measure rather than directly measuring the amount water vapor itself, and therefore WVMR is the variable usually reported from a sounding (Figure 3).\nThe vertical distribution of WVMR can then be integrated to approximate the PWV between any two pressure levels of the atmosphere through a short sequence of equations involving the assumption of atmospheric hydrostatic balance and dividing by the density of the air (The COMET Program/MetEd, 2018).\nFigure 3. Area-Averaged AIRS Water Vapor Mixing Ratio Vertical Profile from NASA\u2019s Giovanni on August 24, 2017, over coastal Texas. The x-axis represents the water vapor mixing ratio in g/kg, air pressure is shown on the y-axis with logarithmic scaling, and each tick represents 100 hectopascals (hPa).\nThe map in the upper-right corner shows the spatial bounds of the domain used to compute the vertical profile. Credit: GES DISC\nFor users interested in quickly obtaining PWV, the quantity can be estimated graphically from WVMR by using an average mixing ratio between two pressure levels. NASA\u2019s Giovanni makes it simple to obtain soundings of WVMR from AIRS using its vertical profile function.\nFigure 3 shows an AIRS WVMR sounding of coastal Texas the day before Hurricane Harvey's devastating landfall in 2017. This sounding represents a snapshot of the water vapor available directly preceding Harvey's rapid intensification into Category 4 status. Note the high levels of WVMR near the surface: this is one factor that likely contributed to the strengthening of Harvey.\nUsers of NASA\u2019s Giovanni can plot their own AIRS WVMR vertical profile and follow this step-by-step tutorial to estimate the PWV at different levels of the atmosphere prior to Hurricane Harvey\u2019s landfall, or they can use the same steps to estimate PWV for their own purposes. With hurricane season in full swing, information about PWV is critical, and instruments like NASA's AIRS can help provide forecasters with vital\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Traditional forecasts rely on ground-based radar systems, which are space-constrained and have high maintenance costs. Consequently, most developing countries depend on a global numerical model with low resolution, instead of operating their own radar systems. To mitigate this gap, we propose the Neural Precipitation Model (NPM), which uses global-scale geostationary satellite imagery. NPM predicts precipitation for up to six hours, with an update every hour. We take three key channels to discriminate rain clouds as input: infrared radiation (at a wavelength of 10.5 \u03bc \u2062 m ), upper- (6.3 \u03bc \u2062 m ), and lower- (7.3 \u03bc \u2062 m ) level water vapor channels. Additionally, NPM introduces positional encoders to capture seasonal and temporal patterns, accounting for variations in precipitation. Our experimental results demonstrate that NPM can predict rainfall in real-time with a resolution of 2 km. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/seominseok0429/Data-driven-Precipitation-Nowcasting-Using-Satellite-Imagery.\nAs global warming accelerates, the damage caused by natural disasters is on the rise. Particularly with increasing temperatures, the intensity of extreme precipitation events escalates (Ombadi et al. 2023), leading to significant human casualties due to disasters such as floods, landslides, and soil erosion. To mitigate the loss of life from these disasters, accurate and real-time precipitation forecasting is essential.\nTraditionally, precipitation forecasting relies on various observational equipment such as radar systems and numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. For instance, the HRRR model (Dowell et al. 2022) utilizes radar data, satellite data, surface observations, aircraft data, weather buoys and ships, model initialization data, and fire/smoke data to provide forecasts at a resolution of approximately 3 km. Additionally, global NWP models such as ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) (Hersbach et al. 2020) and integrated forecasting system (IFS) (Wedi et al. 2015) perform forecasts at a resolution of around 25 km.\nDespite advancements in the observational equipment and the NWP models, essential tools for precipitation forecasting involve installation and maintenance costs that can reach about billions of dollars. Furthermore, algorithms like IFS and ERA5 require supercomputers, making them challenging to operate in countries with limited budgets and resources.\nTo overcome these issues, numerous data-driven weather forecasting methods have been proposed. Pangu-Weather (Bi et al. 2023) and GraphCast (Lam et al. 2023) demonstrate superior performance compared to traditional NWP models like IFS, even when running in a single GPU environment. Similarly, a series of MetNet (Andrychowicz et al. 2023; S\u00f8nderby et al. 2020) shows high accuracy in precipitation forecasting while also operating efficiently on a single GPU. However, these global weather forecasting models still rely on NWP data for their initial conditions, meaning they have not fully eliminated the dependency on supercomputers. Additionally, with a resolution of 25 km, they remain insufficient for predicting localized heavy rainfall events, such as flash floods.\nThe MetNet series and various radar-to-radar benchmark (Veillette, Samsi, and Mattioli 2020) models take radar data as input, and produce radar-based outputs, making radar infrastructure essential. Moreover, radar-to-radar models are unable to detect developing precipitation types that do not appear in radar signals yet, further reducing their effectiveness in certain situations.\nTo address the challenges of supercomputer dependency, radar-only systems, and the difficulty of predicting precipitation without prior radar signals, we propose the real-time neural precipitation model (NPM). In addition, to train our NPM model, we introduce the Geostationary Satellite-to-Radar dataset, which is called Sat2Rdr. Our approach is inspired by traditional methods of predicting precipitation using atmospheric states and cloud characteristics from satellite imagery, which have historically relied on the correlation between cloud-top brightness temperature and surface rainfall rates (Arkin 1979; Sorooshian et al. 2000; Huffman et al. 2010). The dataset utilizes the Infrared (IR) channel at 10.5 \u03bc \u2062 m , the Water Vapor (WV) channel at 6.3 \u03bc \u2062 m , and the WV channel at 7.3 \u03bc \u2062 m \u2014channels closely linked to precipitation in traditional algorithms.\nOur NPM consists of two stages: The first stage predicts satellite images showing the formation and dissipation of clouds associated with precipitation. The second stage estimates rainfall from the predicted satellite images, accurately predicting rain rates by analyzing cloud type and growth stage through infrared and water vapor channels.\nSince the NPM relies solely on satellite imagery, it does not inherently predict seasonal or diurnal precipitation patterns. To overcome this, we incorporate day and hour positional embeddings into the NPM, allowing it to learn these patterns. As shown in Figure 1 from the Papua New Guinea flood case, NPM is capable of forecasting precipitation even in regions without radar coverage, as it uses only satellite imagery and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data as input.\nWe validate the effectiveness of our NPM using various video prediction models on the geostationa\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Those waters crested nearly eight feet high on Mountain Island Lake, which sits directly below Lake Norman and provides the majority of Charlotte\u2019s drinking water.\nAlso affected were at least six structures in Gaston County.\nIn late October, Duke filed an incident report with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, focusing mostly on the damage and needed repairs to its own hydropower facilities.\nAccording to the report, Duke \u201cstayed in direct contact with county emergency management agencies and provided real-time information regarding current conditions and anticipated reservoir levels. \u2026 Duke Energy personnel disconnected power to certain homes and in some cases, to entire streets as directed by emergency management authorities and later reconnected them as directed.\u201d\nHowever, nowhere in that report did the utility mention the property damage in Mecklenburg and Gaston counties following the decision to open the floodgates.\nAround the same time, flood victim Erik Jendresen submitted a letter to the commission urging the agency to further examine Duke\u2019s actions in the week leading up to Helene.\n\u201cWhy, in advance of what proved to be one of the most accurately forecast meteorological events in recent memory, did Duke Energy not commence immediately to lower the levels of each and every one of the 11 lakes that comprise the Catawba-Wateree River Basin,\u201d according to Jendresen\u2019s letter.\nHowever, the commission issued a letter to Duke on Jan. 14 accepting the utility\u2019s explanation on how the incident was handled, presumably ending federal inquiry into the matter.\nDuke Energy spokesman Ben Williamson confirmed on Tuesday that the commission isn\u2019t requesting any additional information regarding the company\u2019s dam operations or communications during the storm.\nBut while the federal government appears satisfied, residents along the Catawba are a different story.\nMountain Island Lake\u2019s tight-knit community has been here before. A group of residents sued and later settled with the utility after a similar event in 2019.\nNow, some of those same people are in a waiting game to see what will happen with their homes.\nFlood victims told Carolina Public Press that they believe Duke Energy was once again not proactive enough in moving water through the system ahead of the storm, which could have significantly reduced the severity of the flood.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really failed here is the trust,\u201d resident Gidget Dennehy said. \u201cUnfortunately, because Duke doesn\u2019t have the integrity to step up to this community and to acknowledge wrongdoing, it\u2019s the government that steps in \u2026 People look to them and blame them when we should be blaming Duke.\u201d\nTwo programs are available to Mecklenburg residents for home buyouts or elevations in the aftermath of the Duke Energy controversy.\nA county-run program has drawn a number of takers. According to Jonathan Beller, a flood mitigation specialist at Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services, 45 property owners have expressed interest in a buyout.\nBeller also said 15 property owners have expressed interest in the county\u2019s retroFIT program, which would cover the cost of either a home elevation or demolition.\nMeanwhile, the state administers its own buyout, elevation and reconstruction programs using federal dollars from FEMA\u2019s Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. Mecklenburg County property owners have submitted 61 buyout applications, 38 elevation applications, two land stabilization requests and one mitigation reconstruction application, said Justin Graney, a spokesman for North Carolina Emergency Management.\nThat\u2019s one source of monetary relief flood victims are banking on. But there could be another.\nResidents have yet to file any lawsuits against Duke \u2014 like they did in 2019 \u2014 although that may still happen.\nDavid Spence, a professor at the University of Texas who specializes in regulation of renewable energy, told CPP that a potential civil action would need to surmount a high bar in order to prove that Duke Energy acted outside the scope of its federally regulated behavior.\nFurthermore, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\u2019s acceptance of Duke Energy\u2019s explanation about the incident would make it difficult for a civil action alleging negligence, according to Spence.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t argue that it\u2019s a nuisance if it\u2019s a federally permitted and specified activity,\u201d he explained. \u201cNow, if it\u2019s negligent, if they\u2019re not following their regulatory mandates, then perhaps you do have consequences.\u201d\nRepublish This Story\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.

Where does it come from? - Reddit\n\nGoogle Search Snippet:\nWhen dew is present on the ground it means that the ground (i.e. the blades of grass) have cooled to the dewpoint temperature of the air.\n\nFull Page Content:\nSelect a tutorial below or scroll down... The Forecasting of Dew The Forecasting of Frost Frost Point and Dew Point Dew/Frost Thickness Functions THE FORECASTING OF DEW METEOROLOGIST JEFF HABY theweatherprediction.com Morning condensation (dew) is very common in some regions and can easily be forecasted. The favorable weather elements for dew include clear skies, light wind, decent soil moisture, and low night-time dewpoint depressions. Dew forms when the temperature becomes equal to the dewpoint. This often happens first at ground level for two reasons. First, longwave emission causes the earth's surface to cool at night. Condensation requires the temperature to decrease to the dewpoint. Second, the soil is often the moisture source for the dew. Warm and moist soils will help with the formation of dew as the soil cools overnight. The cooling of warm and moist soil during the night will cause condensation especially on clear nights. Clear skies allow for the maximum release of longwave radiation to space. Cloudy skies will reflect and absorb while re-emitting longwave radiation back to the surface and that prevents as much cooling from occurring. Light wind prevents the mixing of air right at the surface with drier air aloft. Heavier dew will tend to occur when the wind is light as opposed to when the wind is strong. Especially when soils are moist, the moisture concentration will be higher near the earth's surface than higher above the earth's surface. As the air with higher moisture concentration cools, this air will produce condensation first. Soil moisture is EXTREMELY critical to producing dew (especially heavy dew). Dry regions that have not received rain in over a week or two are much less likely to have morning dew (especially a heavy dew). Once the soil gets a good soaking from a rain, it takes several days for the soil to lose the moisture through evaporation. If nights are clear after a good rain, dew can be expected every morning for the next few days (especially in regions with abundant vegetation, clear skies and light wind). The dewpoint depression is important because it determines how much the air will need to cool to reach saturation. With a large dewpoint depression (greater than 25 units of F), quite a bit of night-time cooling will need to take place in order to produce dew. A low dewpoint depression with the other factors favorable for dew is more likely to produce heavy dew. Dew is important to forecast since it impacts people. Dew can produce a thick film of water all over the car in the morning (can be especially annoying for people that don't have a garage). Time has to be spent wiping the water off the windows in order to see on-coming traffic. Dew is also important to agriculture. Dew recharges the soil moisture and limits evaporation from the soil during the time the dew is forming. Dew can make the mowing of the lawn more difficult. It is much easier to mow the lawn in the late afternoon when the dew has evaporated than it is in the morning. Wet grass clumps together and sticks to everything. Also, you are more prone to getting a dirty shoe when walking on dew covered grass as compared to dry grass. TOP THE FORECASTING OF FROST METEOROLOGIST JEFF HABY theweatherprediction.com When temperatures drop below freezing and the temperature reaches the dew or frost point, the ice on the ground is termed frost or frozen dew. \"Frost\" can form in two ways: Either by deposition or freezing. Depositional frost is also known as white frost or hoar frost. It occurs when the dewpoint (now called the frost point) is below freezing. When this frost forms the water vapor goes directly to the solid state. Depositional frost covers the vegetation, cars, etc. with ice crystal patterns (treelike branching pattern). If the depositional frost is thick enough, it resembles a light snowfall. Frost that forms due to the freezing of liquid water is best referred to as frozen dew. Initially, both the dewpoint and temperature are above freezing when dew forms. Longwave radiational cooling gradually lowers the temperature to at or below freezing during the night. Cold air advection can also do the trick (e.g. Cold front moving through in the middle of the night after dew has formed). Once the temperature falls to freezing, the condensed dew droplets freeze. Frozen dew looks different from white frost. Frozen dew does not have the crystal patterns of white frost. White frost tends to looks whiter while frozen dew tends to look slicker and more difficult to see. Frost and frozen dew can delay people in the morning if it covers their car. Some frosts or frozen dews are much easier to scrape off the car than others. When the temperature is near freezing (29 to 32 F), the ice is fairly easy to scrap off the car windows. It is also quicker to warm up the car windows to above freezing with the defroster when temperatures are near freezing. The bonding of ice crystals is weaker in warm ice than in cold ice. Once temperatures drop into the mid-20's and below, the ice becomes more difficult to remove. It requires more \"elbow grease\" to remove the ice. It also takes longer to warm up the car windows to above freezing. At these temperatures ice is well bonded. Next time you witness ice in the morning, think about the processes that produced the frost or frozen dew. Q: Can frost occur at temperatures above 32\u00b0F? A1: No, frost is defined as a layer of ice that forms on surfaces that are at or below 32\u00b0F. Sometimes frost can occur on your lawn overnight, even though your thermometer may never have dropped to the freezing mark. This is because cold air on clear, calm nights sinks to ground level. Temperatures at the ground can be lower than the temperature only a few feet higher where your thermometer may be located. Since official weather measurements are taken in an instrument shelter four to five feet above the ground, frost can form even when the official temperature is above freezing.

Water moves from the Earth\u2019s surface to the atmosphere via evaporation.\nEvaporation occurs when energy (heat) forces the bonds that hold water molecules together to break. When you\u2019re boiling water on the stove, you\u2019re adding heat to liquid water. This added heat breaks the bonds, causing the water to shift from its liquid state to its gaseous state (water vapor), which we know as steam.\nWater easily evaporates at its boiling point (212\u00b0 F, 100\u00b0 C) but evaporates much more slowly at its freezing point because of the heat energy required to evaporate the water.\nThe opposite of evaporation is condensation. Condensation is the process of water vapor turning back into liquid water. Condensation occurs when saturated air is cooled, such as on the outside of a glass of ice water.\nMost of the moisture in the atmosphere (about 90%) came from water evaporating from oceans, seas, lakes, and rivers. (And because over 70% of Earth\u2019s surface is covered by oceans, they contribute a lot to the overall volume of water evaporating into the atmosphere.) The rest of the moisture in the atmosphere came from plant transpiration and (a very small amount) from sublimation.\nOn a global scale, the amount of water evaporating is about the same as the amount of water delivered to the Earth as precipitation.\nThis does vary geographically, though. Evaporation is more prevalent over the oceans than precipitation, while over the land, precipitation routinely exceeds evaporation. Most of the water that evaporates from the oceans falls back into the oceans as precipitation. Only about 10 percent of the water evaporated from the oceans is transported over land and falls as precipitation. Once evaporated, a water molecule spends about 10 days in the air. The process of evaporation is so great that without precipitation runoff, and groundwater discharge from aquifers, oceans would become nearly empty.\nOne way to produce table salt is to evaporate saline water in evaporation ponds, a technique used by people for thousands of years.\nSeawater contains other valuable minerals that are easily obtained due to evaporation. Water from the Dead Sea is ideal for the extraction of not only table salt, but also magnesium, potash, and bromine. The Dead Sea is actually a lake, located in the Middle East within a closed watershed and without any means of outflow. This closed basin system is abnormal for most lakes. Water primarily leaves the lake by evaporating, resulting in upwards of 1,300 - 1,600 millimeters of evaporated water per year in this desert area! The result is that the waters of the Dead Sea have the highest salinity and density of any sea in the world, too high to support life.\n(Source: Overview of Middle East Water Resources, Middle East Water Data Banks Project).\nBecause energy is required to break the bonds holding water molecules together, evaporation removes heat from the environment, leading to a net cooling. Think of when a physician wipes an alcohol pad on your arm before giving you an injection \u2013 your arm feels cold. That\u2019s because the alcohol rapidly evaporates from the surface of your skin, and with it some heat from the surface of your arm.\nIn climates where the humidity is low and the temperatures are hot, an evaporative cooler can lower the air temperature by 20 degrees F., while it increases humidity. As this map shows, evaporative coolers work best in the dry areas of the United States (red areas marked A) and can work somewhat in the blue areas marked B. But in section C, in the humid eastern U.S., normal air conditioners must be used.\nEvaporative coolers are really quite simple devices, at least compared to air conditioners, because they pull in the dry, hot outdoor air and pass it through an evaporative pad that is kept wet by a supply of water. In a home device, a fan draws the air through the pad causing the water in the pad to evaporate, resulting in cooler air which is then pumped through the house. Much less energy is used as compared to an air conditioner.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The Forecasting of Dew The Forecasting of Frost Frost Point and Dew Point Dew/Frost Thickness Functions THE FORECASTING OF DEW METEOROLOGIST JEFF HABY theweatherprediction.com Morning condensation (dew) is very common in some regions and can easily be forecasted. The favorable weather elements for dew include clear skies, light wind, decent soil moisture, and low night-time dewpoint depressions. Dew forms when the temperature becomes equal to the dewpoint. This often happens first at ground level for two reasons. First, longwave emission causes the earth's surface to cool at night. Condensation requires the temperature to decrease to the dewpoint. Second, the soil is often the moisture source for the dew. Warm and moist soils will help with the formation of dew as the soil cools overnight. The cooling of warm and moist soil during the night will cause condensation especially on clear nights. Clear skies allow for the maximum release of longwave radiation to space. Cloudy skies will reflect and absorb while re-emitting longwave radiation back to the surface and that prevents as much cooling from occurring. Light wind prevents the mixing of air right at the surface with drier air aloft. Heavier dew will tend to occur when the wind is light as opposed to when the wind is strong. Especially when soils are moist, the moisture concentration will be higher near the earth's surface than higher above the earth's surface. As the air with higher moisture concentration cools, this air will produce condensation first. Soil moisture is EXTREMELY critical to producing dew (especially heavy dew). Dry regions that have not received rain in over a week or two are much less likely to have morning dew (especially a heavy dew). Once the soil gets a good soaking from a rain, it takes several days for the soil to lose the moisture through evaporation. If nights are clear after a good rain, dew can be expected every morning for the next few days (especially in regions with abundant vegetation, clear skies and light wind). The dewpoint depression is important because it determines how much the air will need to cool to reach saturation. With a large dewpoint depression (greater than 25 units of F), quite a bit of night-time cooling will need to take place in order to produce dew. A low dewpoint depression with the other factors favorable for dew is more likely to produce heavy dew. Dew is important to forecast since it impacts people. Dew can produce a thick film of water all over the car in the morning (can be especially annoying for people that don't have a garage). Time has to be spent wiping the water off the windows in order to see on-coming traffic. Dew is also important to agriculture. Dew recharges the soil moisture and limits evaporation from the soil during the time the dew is forming. Dew can make the mowing of the lawn more difficult. It is much easier to mow the lawn in the late afternoon when the dew has evaporated than it is in the morning. Wet grass clumps together and sticks to everything. Also, you are more prone to getting a dirty shoe when walking on dew covered grass as compared to dry grass. TOP THE FORECASTING OF FROST METEOROLOGIST JEFF HABY theweatherprediction.com When temperatures drop below freezing and the temperature reaches the dew or frost point, the ice on the ground is termed frost or frozen dew. \"Frost\" can form in two ways: Either by deposition or freezing. Depositional frost is also known as white frost or hoar frost. It occurs when the dewpoint (now called the frost point) is below freezing. When this frost forms the water vapor goes directly to the solid state. Depositional frost covers the vegetation, cars, etc. with ice crystal patterns (treelike branching pattern). If the depositional frost is thick enough, it resembles a light snowfall. Frost that forms due to the freezing of liquid water is best referred to as frozen dew. Initially, both the dewpoint and temperature are above freezing when dew forms. Longwave radiational cooling gradually lowers the temperature to at or below freezing during the night. Cold air advection can also do the trick (e.g. Cold front moving through in the middle of the night after dew has formed). Once the temperature falls to freezing, the condensed dew droplets freeze. Frozen dew looks different from white frost. Frozen dew does not have the crystal patterns of white frost. White frost tends to looks whiter while frozen dew tends to look slicker and more difficult to see. Frost and frozen dew can delay people in the morning if it covers their car. Some frosts or frozen dews are much easier to scrape off the car than others. When the temperature is near freezing (29 to 32 F), the ice is fairly easy to scrap off the car windows. It is also quicker to warm up the car windows to above freezing with the defroster when temperatures are near freezing. The bonding of ice crystals is weaker in warm ice than in cold ice. Once temperatures drop into the mid-20's and below, the ice becomes more difficult to remove. It requires more \"elbow grease\" to remove the ice. It also takes longer to warm up the car windows to above freezing. At these temperatures ice is well bonded. Next time you witness ice in the morning, think about the processes that produced the frost or frozen dew. Q: Can frost occur at temperatures above 32\u00b0F? A1: No, frost is defined as a layer of ice that forms on surfaces that are at or below 32\u00b0F. Sometimes frost can occur on your lawn overnight, even though your thermometer may never have dropped to the freezing mark. This is because cold air on clear, calm nights sinks to ground level. Temperatures at the ground can be lower than the temperature only a few feet higher where your thermometer may be located. Since official weather measurements are taken in an instrument shelter four to five feet above the ground, frost can form even when the official temperature is above freezing.

Sometimes frost can occur on your lawn overnight, even though your thermometer may never have dropped to the freezing mark. This is because cold air on clear, calm nights sinks to ground level. Temperatures at the ground can be lower than the temperature only a few feet higher where your thermometer may be located. Since official weather measurements are taken in an instrument shelter four to five feet above the ground, frost can form even when the official temperature is above freezing.

Evaporation occurs when energy (heat) forces the bonds that hold water molecules ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nThe water cycle is the path that all water follows as it moves around Earth. Water changes between three states of matter \u2014 solid, liquid, and gas \u2014 in the water cycle. Liquid water is found in oceans, rivers, lakes, and even underground. Solid ice is found in glaciers, snow, and at the North and South Poles. Water vapor \u2014 a gas \u2014 is found in Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\nWater can be found all over Earth \u2014 in the ocean, on land, and in the atmosphere. The water cycle is the path that all water follows as it moves around our planet.\nOn Earth, you can find water in all three states of matter: solid, liquid, and gas. Liquid water is found in Earth\u2019s oceans, rivers, lakes, streams, and even in the soil and underground. Solid ice is found in glaciers, snow, and at the North and South Poles. Water vapor \u2014 a gas \u2014 is found in Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\nHow does water travel from a glacier to the ocean to a cloud? That\u2019s where the water cycle comes in.\nLet\u2019s start with how water gets into the atmosphere. There are two main ways this happens:\nWarm water vapor rises up through Earth\u2019s atmosphere. As the water vapor rises higher and higher, the atmosphere\u2019s air cools down. This causes the water vapor to turn back into liquid water in a process known as condensation. When this happens, it creates clouds.\nWhen a cloud becomes full of liquid water, it falls from the sky as rain or snow \u2014 also known as precipitation. Rain falls on the ocean, into lakes and streams and onto the soil. There, it gives water to plants and refills the groundwater we drink.\nSnow falls on mountains or glaciers and freezes in the winter. When temperatures warm up, it melts and water flows into oceans, lakes, and streams. This helps further replenish water on the ground.\nThen, the process starts all over again.\nWe care about the water cycle because water is necessary for all living things. NASA satellites orbiting Earth are helping us understand water on our planet.\nWe need water to drink, and to nourish the plants that grow our food. NASA and its partners use satellites to measure how much water is in Earth\u2019s soil. A satellite called SMAP \u2014 short for Soil Moisture Active Passive \u2014 has been tracking Earth\u2019s soil moisture for more than a decade. These kinds of measurements help us prepare for droughts and floods.\nNASA and its partners also have been measuring water vapor and precipitation in the atmosphere for decades. For example, the international satellite called the Global Precipitation Measurement Mission (GPM) observes when, where, and how much it rains on Earth.\nFor over 30 years, a series of satellite missions with NASA and its partners have measured sea level height. Currently in orbit are Jason-3 \u2014 short for Joint Altimetry Satellite Oceanography Network-3 \u2014 and Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich.\nAs Earth warms, ice on land melts. The water then flows into the ocean, causing the sea level to rise. The melting land ice is measured by another satellite called GRACE-FO, or Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment-Follow On. But GRACE-FO doesn\u2019t just track melting ice. It tracks the movement of water across the planet. It can even measure changes in groundwater hundreds of feet below Earth\u2019s surface.\nAqua\u2019s main goal is to improve our understanding of Earth's water cycle.\nThis satellite network measures rain and snow worldwide.\nGRACE-FO measures changes in Earth\u2019s gravity at least once every 30 days.\nJason-3 is the fourth U.S.-European satellite mission that measures ocean-surface height.\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

When it's cloudy overnight, the ground retains more of its heat, and not as much heat ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nThe following navigation uses TAB to navigate through link items and ENTER or SPACE to open sub-navigation. Press ESCAPE to close.\nHave you ever woken up in the morning and wondered if it rained overnight because the grass was so wet? Sometimes it isn't rain at all, but a good coating of dew that leaves the grass feeling saturated.\nEssentially, dew is the result of moisture that forms because of condensation, according to National Geographic (Opens in a new window) . At this time of year, dew is just as likely as rain to be the reason for wet grass in the morning, but whether it forms at all is related to the weather overnight.\nThe dew we see and feel on the grass in the morning is linked to how cloudy the sky was the previous night, according to Indiana Public Media (Opens in a new window) . When the sky is clear or mostly clear overnight, the ground cools, and the warm air radiates away from the ground, up toward the sky. If the ground cools enough, dew then forms on the grass. When it's cloudy overnight, the ground retains more of its heat, and not as much heat is radiated up to the sky. Even the heat that radiates off the ground is then reflected back toward the Earth's surface when it hits the cloud layer. This means dew is less likely to form.\nIn essence, dewy grass is most likely in the morning following a warm, sunny day that led into a cooler night dominated by clear skies. The presence of dew on the morning grass \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 has even given rise to a saying about what it means for the day's weather. \"When dew is on the grass, rain will never come to pass. When grass is dry at morning light, look for rain before the night,\" is how the old saying goes.\nThere's some truth to the saying, although it's not a foolproof way to predict the day's weather. Dry grass in the morning usually means either it's cloudy or windy, two indicators that rain may be on the way, the National Parks Service (Opens in a new window) reports. A clear night means dew is more likely on the grass, but it's also an indicator of a pleasant, rain-free day to come.\nIf you are in the habit of watching the weather report on the TV news, you've probably heard meteorologists reference the dew point and what it means for how pleasant the weather will be on a given day. The dew point is the temperature at which dew will form, National Geographic reports. The dew point varies from day to day, based on factors including air temperature, time of day and location.\nThe dew point and humidity are closely related. The dew point is the temperature air needs to be cooled in order to achieve relative humidity of 100%, according to the National Weather Service (Opens in a new window) . At the dew point, the air cannot hold any more water in the form of water vapor, the gaseous form of water. Any increase in moisture in the air will be as water in its liquid form, either as fog or precipitation.\nHumidity alone is not always a good indicator of how comfortable it will be outside, but the dew point is. In general, if the dew point is 55 or lower, the air will feel dry, making it feel comfortable outside, according to the National Weather Service. Dew points between 55 and 65 mean the air will feel a bit humid and muggy, especially in the evenings. Dew points of 65 or greater mean there's a lot of moisture in the air, making it feel very humid. Dew points in the 70s are those oppressively humid days we've come to know all too well in northern Illinois.\nCooper's hawks once faced similar threats to bald eagles and peregrine falcons, but these hawks have recovered and now thrive across Illinois.\nIf you don't take precautions before bringing it indoors, your Christmas tree could be the gift that keeps on giving.\nThe Compass is full of District news and general interest nature stories, while Get Going highlights the must-do programs for the coming week.
