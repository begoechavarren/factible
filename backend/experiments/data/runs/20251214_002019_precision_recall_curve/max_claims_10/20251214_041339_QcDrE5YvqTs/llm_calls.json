    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nIf, for the same work, women make only 77 cents for every dollar a man makes, why don\u2019t businesses hire only women? Wages are the biggest expense for most businesses. So, hiring only women would reduce costs by nearly a quarter \u2013 and that would go right to the bottom line. Don\u2019t businesses want to be profitable? Or, are they just really bad at math? Well, actually, it\u2019s the feminists, celebrities and politicians spreading this wage gap myth who have the math problem. Here\u2019s why: The 77-cents-on-the-dollar statistic is calculated by dividing the median earnings of all women working full-time by the median earnings of all men working full-time. In other words, if the average income of all men is, say, 40,000 dollars a year, and the average annual income of all women is, say, 30,800 dollars, that would mean that women earn 77 cents for every dollar a man earns. 30,800 divided by 40,000 equals .77. But these calculations don\u2019t reveal a gender wage injustice because it doesn\u2019t take into account occupation, position, education or hours worked per week. Even a study by the American Association of University Women, a feminist organization, shows that the actual wage gap shrinks to only 6.6 cents when you factor in different choices men and women make. And the key word here is \u201cchoice.\u201d The small wage gap that does exist has nothing to do with paying women less, let alone with sexism; it has to do with differences in individual career choices that men and women make. In 2009, the U.S. Department of Labor released a paper that examined more than 50 peer-reviewed studies and concluded that the oft-cited 23 percent wage gap \u201cmay be almost entirely the result of individual choices being made by both male and female workers.\u201d Well, let\u2019s look at some of those choices. Georgetown University compiled a list of the five best-paying college majors, and the percentage of men or women majoring in those fields: Number 1 best-paying major: Petroleum Engineering: 87% male Number 2: Pharmaceutical Sciences: 48% male 3: Mathematics and Computer Science: 67% male 4: Aerospace Engineering: 88% male 5: Chemical Engineering: 72% male Notice that women out-represent men in only one of the five top-paying majors \u2013 by only a few percentage points. Now consider the same study\u2019s list of the five worst paying college majors: Number 1: Counseling and Psychology: 74% female Number 2: Early Childhood Education: 97% female 3: Theology and Religious Vocations: 66% male 4: Human Services and Community Organization: 81% female 5: Social Work: 88% female Here, it\u2019s the women who lead in all but one category. Even within the same profession, men and women make different career choices that impact how much money they make. Take nursing, where male nurses on the whole earn 18% more than female nurses. The reason? Male nurses gravitate to the best-paying nursing specialties, they work longer hours, and disproportionately find jobs in cities with the highest compensation. Now, here\u2019s how one expert on nursing compensation, Professor Linda Aiken of the University of Pennsylvania, sums up the data: \u201cCareer choices and educational differences explain most, if not all, the gender gap in nursing.\u201d The Department of Labor paper concluded that once these differences are accounted for across all professions, the unexplained wage gap is somewhere between 4.8 and 7 percent \u2013 almost identical to the 6.6 percentage gap found by the AAUW. But why is there any gap at all? No one knows for sure, as both the AAUW and the Labor Department concede. There are so many variables that drive wages that no single study can cover them all. Few wage gap studies control for variables such as dangerous work environment; men are vastly overrepresented, for example, on oil rigs. And here\u2019s another variable: men are more willing and able to work long hours without advance notice. According to Harvard economist Claudia Goldin, even if two lawyers have the same education, same specialty, and work the same number of hours \u2014 firms pay more to someone who is willing to always be \u201con call\u201d and ready to be in the office when the firm needs them, as opposed to wanting a more regular schedule. This isn\u2019t sexism, it\u2019s just common sense. With more realistic categories and definitions, whatever wage gap remains would certainly narrow to point of vanishing. So it seems that business leaders aren\u2019t bad at math simply because they don\u2019t only hire women. Those who claim that for the same work women earn 77 cents on the dollar compared to men, on the other hand, are not merely bad at math --but at telling the truth.

However, other sources indicate that the figure is higher, with women earning 78 cents or 85 cents per dollar in different contexts. This discrepancy suggests a mixed understanding of the gender pay gap."
