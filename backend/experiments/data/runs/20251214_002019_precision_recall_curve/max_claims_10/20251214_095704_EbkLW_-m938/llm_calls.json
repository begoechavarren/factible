In a representative democracy, the people choose governing officials through elections to do so. The definition of \"the people\" and the ways authority is shared among them or delegated by them have changed over time and at varying rates in different countries. Features of democracy often include freedom of assembly, association, personal property, freedom of religion and speech, citizenship, consent of the governed, voting rights, freedom from unwarranted governmental deprivation of the right to life and liberty, and minority rights.\nThe notion of democracy has evolved considerably over time. Throughout history, one can find evidence of direct democracy, in which communities make decisions through popular assembly. Today, the dominant form of democracy is representative democracy, where citizens elect government officials to govern on their behalf such as in a parliamentary or presidential democracy. In the common variant of liberal democracy, the powers of the majority are exercised within the framework of a representative democracy, but a constitution and supreme court limit the majority and protect the minority\u2014usually through securing the enjoyment by all of certain individual rights, such as freedom of speech or freedom of association.[7][8]\nThe term appeared in the 5th century BC in Greek city-states, notably Classical Athens, to mean \"rule of the people\", in contrast to aristocracy (\u1f00\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1, aristokrat\u00eda), meaning \"rule of an elite\".[9] In virtually all democratic governments throughout ancient and modern history, democratic citizenship was initially restricted to an elite class, which was later extended to all adult citizens.

Historically a rare and vulnerable form of government,[10] democratic systems of government have become more prevalent since the 19th century, in particular with various waves of democratization.[11] Democracy garners considerable legitimacy in the modern world,[12] as public opinion across regions tends to strongly favor democratic systems of government relative to alternatives,[13][14] and as even authoritarian states try to present themselves as democratic.[15][16] Democracy more consistently results in improved health, education and economic outcomes.[17] According to the V-Dem Democracy indices and The Economist Democracy Index, less than half the world's population lives in a democracy as of 2022.[18][19] At the same time, while representative democracy is widely valued, Pew Research Center found that dissatisfaction with democratic performance is common even in many established democracies.[20][21]\nAlthough democracy is generally understood to be defined by voting,[1][8] no consensus exists on a precise definition of democracy.[22] Karl Popper says that the \"classical\" view of democracy is, \"in brief, the theory that democracy is the rule of the people and that the people have a right to rule\".[23] One study identified 2,234 adjectives used to describe democracy in the English language.[24]\nDemocratic principles are reflected in all eligible citizens being equal before the law and having equal access to legislative processes.[25] For example, in a representative democracy, every vote has (in theory) equal weight, and the freedom of eligible citizens is secured by legitimised rights and liberties which are typically enshrined in a constitution,[26][27] while other uses of \"democracy\" may encompass direct democracy, in which citizens vote on issues directly.

In a representative democracy, the people choose governing officials through elections to do so. The definition of \"the people\" and the ways authority is shared among them or delegated by them have changed over time and at varying rates in different countries. Features of democracy often include freedom of assembly, association, personal property, freedom of religion and speech, citizenship, consent of the governed, voting rights, freedom from unwarranted governmental deprivation of the right to life and liberty, and minority rights.\nThe notion of democracy has evolved considerably over time. Throughout history, one can find evidence of direct democracy, in which communities make decisions through popular assembly. Today, the dominant form of democracy is representative democracy, where citizens elect government officials to govern on their behalf such as in a parliamentary or presidential democracy. In the common variant of liberal democracy, the powers of the majority are exercised within the framework of a representative democracy, but a constitution and supreme court limit the majority and protect the minority\u2014usually through securing the enjoyment by all of certain individual rights, such as freedom of speech or freedom of association.[7][8]\nThe term appeared in the 5th century BC in Greek city-states, notably Classical Athens, to mean \"rule of the people\", in contrast to aristocracy (\u1f00\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1, aristokrat\u00eda), meaning \"rule of an elite\".[9] In virtually all democratic governments throughout ancient and modern history, democratic citizenship was initially restricted to an elite class, which was later extended to all adult citizens. In most modern democracies, this was achieved through the suffrage movements of the 19th and 20th centuries.\nDemocracy contrasts with forms of government where power is not vested in the general population of a state, such as authoritarian systems. Historically a rare and vulnerable form of government,[10] democratic systems of government have become more prevalent since the 19th century, in particular with various waves of democratization.[11] Democracy garners considerable legitimacy in the modern world,[12] as public opinion across regions tends to strongly favor democratic systems of government relative to alternatives,[13][14] and as even authoritarian states try to present themselves as democratic.[15][16] Democracy more consistently results in improved health, education and economic outcomes.[17] According to the V-Dem Democracy indices and The Economist Democracy Index, less than half the world's population lives in a democracy as of 2022.[18][19] At the same time, while representative democracy is widely valued, Pew Research Center found that dissatisfaction with democratic performance is common even in many established democracies.[20][21]\nAlthough democracy is generally understood to be defined by voting,[1][8] no consensus exists on a precise definition of democracy.[22] Karl Popper says that the \"classical\" view of democracy is, \"in brief, the theory that democracy is the rule of the people and that the people have a right to rule\".[23] One study identified 2,234 adjectives used to describe democracy in the English language.[24]\nDemocratic principles are reflected in all eligible citizens being equal before the law and having equal access to legislative processes.[25] For example, in a representative democracy, every vote has (in theory) equal weight, and the freedom of eligible citizens is secured by legitimised rights and liberties which are typically enshrined in a constitution,[26][27] while other uses of \"democracy\" may encompass direct democracy, in which citizens vote on issues directly. According to the United Nations, democracy \"provides an environment that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms, and in which the freely expressed will of people is exercised.\"[28]\nOne theory holds that democracy requires three fundamental principles: upward control (sovereignty residing at the lowest levels of authority), political equality, and social norms by which individuals and institutions only consider acceptable acts that reflect the first two principles of upward control and political equality.[29] Legal equality, political freedom and rule of law[30] are often identified by commentators as foundational characteristics for a well-functioning democracy.[22]\nIn some countries, notably in the United Kingdom (which originated the Westminster system), the dominant principle is that of parliamentary sovereignty, while maintaining judicial independence.[31][32] In India, parliamentary sovereignty is subject to the Constitution of India which includes judicial review.[33] Though the term \"democracy\" is typically used in the context of a political state, the principles also are potentially applicable to private organisations, such as clubs, societies and firms.\nDemocracies may use many different decision-making methods, but majority rule is the dominant form. Without compensation, like legal protections of individual or group rights, political minorities can be oppressed by the \"tyranny of the majority\". Majority rule involves a competitive approach, opposed to consensus democracy, creating the need that elections, and generally deliberation, be substantively and procedurally \"fair\", i.e., just and equitable. In some countries, freedom of political expression, freedom of speech, and\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

I am a supporter of several of these initiatives, and I will work hard to make sure the voices of average Americans are not ignored.\nTogether, I believe that these steps will result in a democratic system that is more honest, less beholden to the rich special interests and individuals, and more accountable to all segments of the American population.\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky (IL-09) released the following statement in response to President Donald Trump\u2019s joint address to Congress:\n\u201cTonight, President Donald Trump spent nearly two hours lying to the American public. I found this speech insulting and disrespectful to millions, including myself. Trump is not doing anything to help working people. What ever happened to his promise to lower costs? He wants to gut health care and take food out of the mouths of poor children to give $4.5 trillion in tax cuts to his billionaire supporters.\nWASHINGTON - Today, Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky (IL-09) released the following statement on her decision to boycott President Donald Trump\u2019s joint address to Congress: \u201cWe are living in unprecedented times. We have a President of the United States who thinks he has unilateral power and is breaking our laws and violating our constitution day in and day out. This is not business as usual and I refuse to normalize his egregious language and behavior.\nPresident Donald Trump promised to lower the high cost of living in the United States, and he has done the exact opposite. The chaos, confusion, and fear Trump has unleashed during his first month in office has not improved the quality of life of the American people. But billionaires? They are getting more tax cuts.\nOn Monday, President Donald Trump was sworn in as the 47th President of the United States and, almost immediately, issued a slew of executive orders that attack our fundamental freedoms.\nThank you to the people of Illinois\u2019 9th Congressional District for once again choosing me to be your voice in Congress. It truly is the honor of a lifetime! The fight for equal rights for all, an economy that works for everyday Americans, not just the rich, reproductive rights, and environmental protections goes on. Keep the faith. Let's get to work.\nA fundamental building block of our democracy is the right of American citizens to vote and choose their representatives. Election Day is Tuesday, November 5th. If you need information on your polling place, or would like to locate a ballot drop box location, please go to Elections.IL.Gov. I encourage everyone to make their voice heard if you have not already.\nWe got some great news last week! Thanks to the hard work of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, three Americans were released from wrongful detention in Russia. Evan Gershkovich, Marine Veteran Paul Whelan, and Russian-American radio journalist Alsu Kurmasheva are now back in the United States, returning home after unimaginable suffering.\nThere is no doubt in my mind that President Joe Biden will go down in history as one of the most consequential presidents of all time. In his one term in office, President Biden created more jobs than any previous administration in the same time span. He lowered prescription drug prices and capped insulin for Medicare beneficiaries at $35 a month.\n*By appointment only\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Its roots lay in the Homeric agora, the meeting of the people. The Athenian Ecclesia, for which exists the most detailed record, was already functioning in Draco\u2019s day (c. 621 BC). In the course of Solon\u2019s codification of the law (c. 594 BC), the Ecclesia became coterminous with the body of male citizens 18 years of age or over and had final control over policy, including the right to hear appeals in the h\u0113liaia (public court), take part in the election of archons (chief magistrates), and confer special privileges on individuals. In the Athens of the 5th and 4th centuries BC, the prytaneis, a committee of the Boule (council), summoned the Ecclesia both for regular meetings, held four times in each 10th of the year, and for special sessions. Aside from confirmation of magistrates, consideration of ways and means and similar fixed procedures, the agenda was fixed by the prytaneis. Since motions had to originate in the Boule, the Ecclesia could not initiate new business. After discussion open to all members, a vote was taken, usually by show of hands, a simple majority determining the result in most cases. Assemblies of this sort existed in most Greek city-states, continuing to function throughout the Hellenistic and Roman periods, though under the Roman Empire their powers gradually atrophied.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Rather than oblige leaders to continually seek popular input, as was the case in early democracy, we elect them for a period of several years, then allow them to go about the business of governing, and finally decide whether to reelect them. The second difference is that with a broad suffrage, modern democracy extends the right of political participation to more people than was the case in most early democracies. Over time, as previously marginalized groups\u2014including African Americans, women, and those without property\u2014asserted their rights, modern democracy has come to mean the possibility of political participation for all adults.

Some lacked constitutions and even elections, Stasavage says, but nonetheless \u201cstill adhered to the principle that the people ought to hold some sort of power.\u201d\nQuestions about what a democracy can or should be are very much alive in the US today, amidst a pandemic that has tested faith in local, state, and federal government responses in what already would have been a contentious presidential election year. While many saw the suffering caused by COVID-19 as the result of a failure of an elected government to protect and serve its citizens, demonstrators this spring compared restrictions designed to halt the virus\u2019s spread to \u201ctyranny\u201d\u2014implying they were democracy\u2019s true defenders.\nMore globally, some historians, such as Michael Lind, have expressed concerns about democracy\u2019s viability, sounding alarm bells over its \u201cdecay\u201d in Western Europe and North America. But others, including Jill Lepore, have acknowledged that while the 21st century has seen a decline in the number of democracies, the concept has previously survived dire threats\u2014such as in the 1930s, when industrialized nations turned to fascism.\nHeading into the 2020 general election period, NYU News talked with Stasavage about where democracy has been, where it\u2019s headed, and why he remains cautiously optimistic about its survival\u2014provided we heed history\u2019s lessons.\nDid the Greeks actually \u201cinvent\u201d democracy?\nThe Greeks gave us the word demokratia, which in its literal sense means that the people have power. But they were not the only ones to come up with the idea. A great many human societies over time have ruled themselves with this basic notion in mind. From the woodlands of Northeastern America prior to European conquest to Ancient Mesopotamia to Precolonial Africa, many societies operated under the basic principle that those who ruled should seek consent from their people before making decisions. Even if these societies did not have elections or written constitutions, they still adhered to the principle that the people ought to hold some sort of power.\nI call this pattern early democracy, and it involved a very deep form of political participation for those who had the right to it.\nHow does the form of government we have in the United States compare to those earlier versions of democracy?\nThe United States was the first modern democracy. Modern democracy differs from early democracy in two important ways. The first involves the emphasis on election of leaders. Rather than oblige leaders to continually seek popular input, as was the case in early democracy, we elect them for a period of several years, then allow them to go about the business of governing, and finally decide whether to reelect them. The second difference is that with a broad suffrage, modern democracy extends the right of political participation to more people than was the case in most early democracies. Over time, as previously marginalized groups\u2014including African Americans, women, and those without property\u2014asserted their rights, modern democracy has come to mean the possibility of political participation for all adults. The potential downside of modern democracy, in the US and elsewhere, is that it offers a form of political participation that is broad but which risks not being very deep. Simply having the right to vote every few years may not be sufficient to satisfy people\u2019s need for participation.\nYou write that the nation\u2019s founders, despite their foresight in many areas, \u201cdid not solve the problem of distrust\u201d of government. What would they make of the current moment, when we find trust in government at a near-historic low?\nOne common fear expressed by the Antifederalists, who opposed ratifying the Constitution, was that in a republic covering such a vast territory, the great mass of the population would be too distant from the seat of power. They might be able to participate in elections every few years, but between those moments, they would lack any connection with government. The feared consequence of this problem of scale was that the people would begin to distrust government, while also being susceptible to 18th-century versions of fake news.\nIn Federalist 10, James Madison tried to downplay such fears, but a few short years after the ratification of the Constitution he would change his tune. He didn\u2019t shift to saying that small republics were actually better, but he did say that in a republic on the scale of the United States, constant investments needed to be made to keep the people informed of and connected with government. To achieve this Madison argued that there should be subsidies for newspaper delivery, and this was something that happened with the P\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Many of the revolution's ideas are considered fundamental principles of liberal democracy,[1] and its values remain central to modern French political discourse.[2] It was caused by a combination of social, political, and economic factors which the existing regime proved unable to manage.\nFinancial crisis and widespread social distress led to the convocation of the Estates General in May 1789, its first meeting since 1614. The representatives of the Third Estate broke away and re-constituted themselves as a National Assembly in June. The Storming of the Bastille in Paris on 14 July led to a series of radical measures by the Assembly, including the abolition of feudalism, state control over the Catholic Church in France, and issuing the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.\nThe next three years were dominated by a struggle for political control. King Louis XVI's attempted flight to Varennes in June 1791 further discredited the monarchy, and military defeats after the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in April 1792 led to the insurrection of 10 August 1792. As a result, the monarchy was replaced by the French First Republic in September, followed by the execution of Louis XVI himself in January 1793.\nAfter another revolt in June 1793, the constitution was suspended, and political power passed from the National Convention to the Committee of Public Safety, dominated by radical Jacobins led by Maximilien Robespierre. About 16,000 people were sentenced by the Revolutionary Tribunal and executed in the Reign of Terror, which ended in July 1794 with the Thermidorian Reaction. Weakened by external threats and internal opposition, the Committee of Public Safety was replaced in November 1795 by the Directory. Its instability ended in 1799 with the coup of 18 Brumaire and the establishment of the Consulate, with Napoleon Bonaparte as First Consul.\nThe Revolution resulted from multiple long-term and short-term factors, culminating in a social, economic, financial and political crisis in the late 1780s.[3][4][5] Combined with resistance to reform by the ruling elite and indecisive policy by Louis XVI and his ministers, the result was a crisis the state was unable to manage.[6][7]\nBetween 1715 and 1789, the French population grew from 21 to 28 million, 20% of whom lived in towns or cities, Paris alone having over 600,000 inhabitants.[8] This was accompanied by a tripling in the size of the middle class, which comprised almost 10% of the population by 1789.[9] Despite increases in overall prosperity, its benefits were largely restricted to the rentier and mercantile classes, while the living standards fell for wage labourers and peasant farmers who rented their land.[10][11] Economic recession from 1785, combined with bad harvests in 1787 and 1788, led to high unemployment and food prices, causing a financial and political crisis.[3][12][13][14]\nWhile the state also experienced a debt crisis, the level of debt itself was not high compared with Britain's.[15] A significant problem was that tax rates varied widely from one region to another, were often different from the official amounts, and were collected inconsistently. The complexity and lack of accountability caused resentment among all taxpayers.[16][b] Attempts to simplify the system were blocked by the regional Parlements which approved financial policy. The resulting impasse led to the calling of the Estates General of 1789, which became radicalised by the struggle for control of public finances.[18]\nLouis XVI was willing to consider reforms, but he often backed down when faced with opposition from conservative elements within the nobility. Enlightenment critiques of social institutions were widely discussed among the educated French elite. At the same time, the American Revolution and the European revolts of the 1780s inspired public debate on issues such as patriotism, liberty, equality, and democracy. These shaped the response of the educated public to the crisis,[19] while scandals such as the Affair of the Diamond Necklace fuelled widespread anger at the court, nobility, and church officials.[20]\nFrance faced a series of budgetary crises during the 18th century as revenues failed to keep pace with expenditure.[21][22] Despite solid economic growth, the use of tax farmers meant this was not reflected in a proportional growth in state tax income.[21] As the nobility and Church benefited from a variety of exemptions, the tax burden fell mainly on the lower classes.[23] Reform was difficult because new tax laws had to be registered with regional judicial bodies or parlements that were able to block them. The king could impose laws by decree, but this risked open conflict with the parlements, the nobility, and those subject to new taxes.[24]\nFrance primarily used loans to fund the 1778 to 1783 Anglo-French War. Even after it ended, the monarchy continued to borrow heavily, and by 1788, half of state revenue went on servicing its debt.[25] In 1786, the French finance minister, Calonne, proposed reforms including a universal land tax, the abolition of grain controls and internal tariffs, and new provincial assemblies appointed by the king. The new taxes were rejected, first by a hand-picked Assembly of Notables dominated by the nobility, then by the parlements when submitted by Calonne's successor Brienne. The notables and parlements argued that the proposed taxes could only be approved by an Estates-General, a representative body that last met in 1614.[26]\nThe conflict between the Crown and the parlements became a national political crisis. Both sides issued a series of public statements, the government arguing that it was combating privilege, and the parlement defending the ancient rights of the nation. Public opinion was firmly on the side o\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

In this lecture, Professor Kagan continues to discuss the constitution of Athens. In particular, he explores the judicial workings of Athens.\n\nFull Page Content:\nAthenian democracy, emerging in the Greek city-state of Athens from 460 BCE to 320 BCE, is recognized as one of the earliest forms of direct democracy. It allowed male citizens to actively participate in public affairs, including voting on leaders, laws, and critical issues through assemblies held on a designated hill. The assembly, which could accommodate around 6,000 citizens, was central to this political system, enabling citizens to voice their opinions and decisions openly. Additionally, a smaller council known as the Boule, composed of 500 randomly selected citizens, played a crucial role in governance and oversight.\nDespite its innovative approach to citizen involvement, Athenian democracy had significant limitations. Notably, the political rights were confined to adult male citizens, excluding women, enslaved individuals, and non-residents from the democratic process. This exclusion raises important considerations regarding the broader implications of democracy in historical contexts. While Athenian democracy ultimately did not endure, its principles and structure influenced modern democratic systems, particularly concepts of public participation and checks and balances. The legacy of Athenian democracy continues to be a topic of interest and analysis in discussions about governance and civic responsibility today.\nAthenian democracy was a form of government that originated in the Greek city-state of Athens between 460 BCE to 320 BCE. While other Greek city-states experimented with democracy, only Athens truly embraced the concept. Athenian citizens held great political power over their public affairs through the use of public assemblies and participation in councils and courts. These citizens were able to vote for their leaders, laws, and other crucial measures. Athenian democracy had several weaknesses, particularly its exclusion of women, enslaved people, and non-residents from the political process. However, the ideas and ideals of the system flourished for thousands of years and went on to inspire modern forms of democracy.\nIn most ancient societies, government participation by regular citizens was minimal or nonexistent. Most governments were monarchies or oligarchies\u2014governments ruled by a small number of people. Frequently, individuals or married couples ruled as kings, queens, pharaohs, or other types of monarch. These leaders held most or all power in the country and, upon their deaths, their powers passed immediately to their children or to handpicked successors. This unquestioned line of succession was termed a dynasty.\nThe concept of citizens voting for their leaders or participating in making laws was unknown in most cultures. Rather, citizens were often led to believe that the monarchs held their power due to divine right, or were themselves divine. For that reason, the rulers and their dynasties were often considered infallible and their decisions and right to rule could not be questioned. Dissent frequently led to severe punishment, including banishment, arrest, torture, or death.\nAncient Greece was an unusual society in that it was formed by a large and loosely associated group of city-states\u2014small, mostly independent governing units. A great diversity of lands and peoples governed by ancient Greece, along with Greek philosophies such as humanism, led to wide varieties in forms of government. Some city-states ruled by oligarchies allowed for a degree of popular representation in government. Greek city-states including Argos, Erythrai, Rhodes, and Syracuse developed systems that included notable democratic elements. However, these political experiments did not last and were not well chronicled by ancient historians.\nThe strong and well-organized democratic government that developed in the city-state of Athens between 460 BCE to 320 BCE was well documented. Greek historians such as Xenophon, Herodotus, and Thucydides kept records of this government\u2019s structure, duties, powers, and accomplishments. Followers of the philosopher Aristotle helped to write the government\u2019s constitution. Laws, contracts, and speeches were transcribed in lasting form, and playwrights even spoofed the Athenian government in comedies. And while Athenian democracy did not last, its many records allowed its memory and spirit to inspire representative governments millennia later.\nAncient Greece helped to form the basis of modern Western Civilization. Its revolutions in philosophy, art, architecture, and entertainment created some of the world\u2019s most cherished traditions and beliefs. Perhaps no legacy of ancient Greece is as strong today as the spirit of democracy formed and practiced in Athens. Under Athenian democracy, all male citizens were allowed equal rights in politics. They were free to speak their opinions, vote for their leaders, and serve in government offices. Political actions took place in public places open to all citizens. In fact, the word democracy comes from the Greek words d\u0113mos, or \u201ccommon people,\u201d and kratos, or \u201crule.\u201d\nThe hub of the Athenian democratic system was the assembly. The assembly met at least once, and often several times, each month on a specified hill in Athens. The hill was large enough to host some 6,000 citizens, a fair percentage of the city\u2019s overall population of approximately 45,000 male citizens. Assemblies were overseen by nine presidents who were elected just for that occasion and monitored the proceedings and tallied votes.\nDuring an assembly, citizens had permission to speak freely and publicly, as well as vote for candidates or on pressing issues. Citizens generally voted just by raising their hands to show agreement. In cases requiring a secret ballot, citizens voted by etching words or names on bits of broken pottery which were then examined and tallied. Voting might involve choosing new officials or assessing the performance of current officials.

They were free to speak their opinions, vote for their leaders, and serve in ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAthenian democracy, emerging in the Greek city-state of Athens from 460 BCE to 320 BCE, is recognized as one of the earliest forms of direct democracy. It allowed male citizens to actively participate in public affairs, including voting on leaders, laws, and critical issues through assemblies held on a designated hill. The assembly, which could accommodate around 6,000 citizens, was central to this political system, enabling citizens to voice their opinions and decisions openly. Additionally, a smaller council known as the Boule, composed of 500 randomly selected citizens, played a crucial role in governance and oversight.\nDespite its innovative approach to citizen involvement, Athenian democracy had significant limitations. Notably, the political rights were confined to adult male citizens, excluding women, enslaved individuals, and non-residents from the democratic process. This exclusion raises important considerations regarding the broader implications of democracy in historical contexts. While Athenian democracy ultimately did not endure, its principles and structure influenced modern democratic systems, particularly concepts of public participation and checks and balances. The legacy of Athenian democracy continues to be a topic of interest and analysis in discussions about governance and civic responsibility today.\nAthenian democracy was a form of government that originated in the Greek city-state of Athens between 460 BCE to 320 BCE. While other Greek city-states experimented with democracy, only Athens truly embraced the concept. Athenian citizens held great political power over their public affairs through the use of public assemblies and participation in councils and courts. These citizens were able to vote for their leaders, laws, and other crucial measures. Athenian democracy had several weaknesses, particularly its exclusion of women, enslaved people, and non-residents from the political process. However, the ideas and ideals of the system flourished for thousands of years and went on to inspire modern forms of democracy.\nIn most ancient societies, government participation by regular citizens was minimal or nonexistent. Most governments were monarchies or oligarchies\u2014governments ruled by a small number of people. Frequently, individuals or married couples ruled as kings, queens, pharaohs, or other types of monarch. These leaders held most or all power in the country and, upon their deaths, their powers passed immediately to their children or to handpicked successors. This unquestioned line of succession was termed a dynasty.\nThe concept of citizens voting for their leaders or participating in making laws was unknown in most cultures. Rather, citizens were often led to believe that the monarchs held their power due to divine right, or were themselves divine. For that reason, the rulers and their dynasties were often considered infallible and their decisions and right to rule could not be questioned. Dissent frequently led to severe punishment, including banishment, arrest, torture, or death.\nAncient Greece was an unusual society in that it was formed by a large and loosely associated group of city-states\u2014small, mostly independent governing units. A great diversity of lands and peoples governed by ancient Greece, along with Greek philosophies such as humanism, led to wide varieties in forms of government. Some city-states ruled by oligarchies allowed for a degree of popular representation in government. Greek city-states including Argos, Erythrai, Rhodes, and Syracuse developed systems that included notable democratic elements. However, these political experiments did not last and were not well chronicled by ancient historians.\nThe strong and well-organized democratic government that developed in the city-state of Athens between 460 BCE to 320 BCE was well documented.

Many of the revolution's ideas are considered fundamental principles of liberal democracy,[1] and its values remain central to modern French political discourse.[2] It was caused by a combination of social, political, and economic factors which the existing regime proved unable to manage.\nFinancial crisis and widespread social distress led to the convocation of the Estates General in May 1789, its first meeting since 1614. The representatives of the Third Estate broke away and re-constituted themselves as a National Assembly in June. The Storming of the Bastille in Paris on 14 July led to a series of radical measures by the Assembly, including the abolition of feudalism, state control over the Catholic Church in France, and issuing the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.\nThe next three years were dominated by a struggle for political control. King Louis XVI's attempted flight to Varennes in June 1791 further discredited the monarchy, and military defeats after the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in April 1792 led to the insurrection of 10 August 1792. As a result, the monarchy was replaced by the French First Republic in September, followed by the execution of Louis XVI himself in January 1793.\nAfter another revolt in June 1793, the constitution was suspended, and political power passed from the National Convention to the Committee of Public Safety, dominated by radical Jacobins led by Maximilien Robespierre. About 16,000 people were sentenced by the Revolutionary Tribunal and executed in the Reign of Terror, which ended in July 1794 with the Thermidorian Reaction. Weakened by external threats and internal opposition, the Committee of Public Safety was replaced in November 1795 by the Directory. Its instability ended in 1799 with the coup of 18 Brumaire and the establishment of the Consulate, with Napoleon Bonaparte as First Consul.\nThe Revolution resulted from multiple long-term and short-term factors, culminating in a social, economic, financial and political crisis in the late 1780s.[3][4][5] Combined with resistance to reform by the ruling elite and indecisive policy by Louis XVI and his ministers, the result was a crisis the state was unable to manage.[6][7]\nBetween 1715 and 1789, the French population grew from 21 to 28 million, 20% of whom lived in towns or cities, Paris alone having over 600,000 inhabitants.[8] This was accompanied by a tripling in the size of the middle class, which comprised almost 10% of the population by 1789.[9] Despite increases in overall prosperity, its benefits were largely restricted to the rentier and mercantile classes, while the living standards fell for wage labourers and peasant farmers who rented their land.[10][11] Economic recession from 1785, combined with bad harvests in 1787 and 1788, led to high unemployment and food prices, causing a financial and political crisis.[3][12][13][14]\nWhile the state also experienced a debt crisis, the level of debt itself was not high compared with Britain's.[15] A significant problem was that tax rates varied widely from one region to another, were often different from the official amounts, and were collected inconsistently. The complexity and lack of accountability caused resentment among all taxpayers.[16][b] Attempts to simplify the system were blocked by the regional Parlements which approved financial policy. The resulting impasse led to the calling of the Estates General of 1789, which became radicalised by the struggle for control of public finances.[18]\nLouis XVI was willing to consider reforms, but he often backed down when faced with opposition from conservative elements within the nobility. Enlightenment critiques of social institutions were widely discussed among the educated French elite. At the same time, the American Revolution and the European revolts of the 1780s inspired public debate on issues such as patriotism, liberty, equality, and democracy. These shaped the response of the educated public to the crisis,[19] while scandals such as the Affair of the Diamond Necklace fuelled widespread anger at the court, nobility, and church officials.[20]\nFrance faced a series of budgetary crises during the 18th century as revenues failed to keep pace with expenditure.[21][22] Despite solid economic growth, the use of tax farmers meant this was not reflected in a proportional growth in state tax income.[21] As the nobility and Church benefited from a variety of exemptions, the tax burden fell mainly on the lower classes.[23] Reform was difficult because new tax laws had to be registered with regional judicial bodies or parlements that were able to block them. The king could impose laws by decree, but this risked open conflict with the parlements, the nobility, and those subject to new taxes.[24]\nFrance primarily used loans to fund the 1778 to 1783 Anglo-French War. Even after it ended, the monarchy continued to borrow heavily, and by 1788, half of state revenue went on servicing its debt.[25] In 1786, the French finance minister, Calonne, proposed reforms including a universal land tax, the abolition of grain controls and internal tariffs, and new provincial assemblies appointed by the king. The new taxes were rejected, first by a hand-picked Assembly of Notables dominated by the nobility, then by the parlements when submitted by Calonne's successor Brienne. The notables and parlements argued that the proposed taxes could only be approved by an Estates-General, a representative body that last met in 1614.[26]\nThe conflict between the Crown and the parlements became a national political crisis. Both sides issued a series of public statements, the government arguing that it was combating privilege, and the parlement defending the ancient rights of the nation. Public opinion was firmly on the side o\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

(Gilder Leh The basic principle that governed voting in colonial America was that voters should have a \"stake in society.\" Leading colonists associated democracy with disorder and mob rule, and believed that the vote should be restricted to those who owned property or paid taxes. Only these people, in their view, were committed members of the community and were sufficiently independent to vote. Each of the thirteen colonies required voters either to own a certain amount of land or personal property, or to pay a specified amount in taxes.\nMany colonies imposed other restrictions on voting, including religious tests. Catholics were barred from voting in five colonies and Jews in four.\nThe right to vote varied widely in colonial America. In frontier areas, seventy to eighty percent of white men could vote. But in some cities, the percentage was just forty to fifty percent.\nThe American Revolution was fought in part over the issue of voting. The Revolutionaries rejected the British argument that representation in Parliament could be virtual (that is, that English members of Parliament could adequately represent the interests of the colonists). Instead, the Revolutionaries argued that government derived its legitimacy from the consent of the governed.\nThis made many restrictions on voting seem to be a violation of fundamental rights. During the period immediately following the Revolution, some states replaced property qualifications with taxpaying requirements. This reflected the principle that there should be \"no taxation without representation.\" Other states allowed anyone who served in the army or militia to vote. Vermont was the first state to eliminate all property and taxpaying qualifications for voting.\nBy 1790, all states had eliminated religious requirements for voting. As a result, approximately 60 to 70 percent of adult white men could vote. During this time, six states (Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Vermont) permitted free African Americans to vote.\nThe US Constitution left the issue of voting rights up to the states. The only thing that the Constitution said about voting was that those entitled to vote for the \"most numerous Branch of the state legislature\" could vote for members of the House of Representatives.\nDuring the first half of the nineteenth century, the election process changed dramatically. Voting by voice was replaced by voting by written ballot. This was not the same thing as a secret ballot, which was instituted only in the late nineteenth century; parties printed ballots on colored paper, so that it was still possible to determine who had voted for which candidate.\nThe most significant political innovation of the early nineteenth century was the abolition of property qualifications for voting and officeholding. Hard times resulting from the Panic of 1819 led many people to demand an end to property restrictions on voting and officeholding. In 1800, just three states (Kentucky, New Hampshire, and Vermont) had universal white manhood suffrage. By 1830, ten states permitted white manhood suffrage without qualification. Eight states restricted the vote to taxpayers, and six imposed a property qualification for suffrage. In 1860, just five states limited suffrage to taxpayers and only two still imposed property qualifications. And after 1840, a number of states, mainly in the Midwest, allowed immigrants who intended to become citizens to vote.\nPressure for expansion of voting rights came from propertyless men; from territories eager to attract settlers; and from political parties seeking to broaden their base.\nIronically, the period that saw the advent of universal white manhood suffrage also saw new restrictions imposed on voting by African Americans. Every new state that joined the Union after 1819 explicitly denied blacks the right to vote. In 1855, only five states\u2014Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont\u2014allowed African Americans to vote without significant restrictions. In 1826, only sixteen black New Yorkers were qualified to vote. The era of universal white manhood suffrage also saw other restrictions on voting. In New Jersey, the one state that had allowed women property holders to vote, women lost the right to vote. Twelve states forbade paupers from voting and two dozen states excluded felons. After 1830, interest in voting registration increased. There were also some attempts to impose literacy tests and prolonged residence requirements (ranging up to twenty-one years) in the 1850s.\nThe transition from property qualifications to universal white manhood suffrage occurred gradually, without violence and with surprisingly little dissension, except in Rhode Island, where lack of progress toward democratization provoked an episode known as the Dorr War.\nIn 1841, Rhode Island, still operating under a Royal Charter granted in 1663, restricted suffrage to landowners and their eldest sons. The charter lacked a bill of rights and grossly underrepresented growing industrial cities, such as Providence, in the state legislature. As Rhode Island grew increasingly urban and industrial, the state\u2019s landless population increased and fewer residents were eligible to vote. By 1841, just 11,239 out of 26,000 adult males were qualified to vote.\nIn 1841, Thomas W. Dorr, a Harvard-educated attorney, organized an extralegal convention to frame a new state constitution and abolish voting restrictions. The state\u2019s governor declared Dorr and his supporters guilty of insurrection, proclaimed a state of emergency, and called out the state militia. Dorr tried unsuccessfully to capture the state arsenal at Providence. He was arrested, found guilty of high treason, and sentenced to life imprisonment at hard labor. To appease popular resentment, the governor pardoned Dorr the next year, and the state adopted a new constitution in 1843. This constitution extended\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Only these people, in their view, were committed members of the community and were sufficiently independent to vote. Each of the thirteen colonies required voters either to own a certain amount of land or personal property, or to pay a specified amount in taxes.\nMany colonies imposed other restrictions on voting, including religious tests. Catholics were barred from voting in five colonies and Jews in four.\nThe right to vote varied widely in colonial America. In frontier areas, seventy to eighty percent of white men could vote. But in some cities, the percentage was just forty to fifty percent.\nThe American Revolution was fought in part over the issue of voting. The Revolutionaries rejected the British argument that representation in Parliament could be virtual (that is, that English members of Parliament could adequately represent the interests of the colonists). Instead, the Revolutionaries argued that government derived its legitimacy from the consent of the governed.\nThis made many restrictions on voting seem to be a violation of fundamental rights. During the period immediately following the Revolution, some states replaced property qualifications with taxpaying requirements. This reflected the principle that there should be \"no taxation without representation.\" Other states allowed anyone who served in the army or militia to vote. Vermont was the first state to eliminate all property and taxpaying qualifications for voting.\nBy 1790, all states had eliminated religious requirements for voting. As a result, approximately 60 to 70 percent of adult white men could vote.

The only thing that the Constitution said about voting was that those entitled to vote for the \"most numerous Branch of the state legislature\" could vote for members of the House of Representatives.\nDuring the first half of the nineteenth century, the election process changed dramatically. Voting by voice was replaced by voting by written ballot. This was not the same thing as a secret ballot, which was instituted only in the late nineteenth century; parties printed ballots on colored paper, so that it was still possible to determine who had voted for which candidate.\nThe most significant political innovation of the early nineteenth century was the abolition of property qualifications for voting and officeholding. Hard times resulting from the Panic of 1819 led many people to demand an end to property restrictions on voting and officeholding.

Participation was open to adult, free male citizens (i.e., not a metic, woman or slave). Adult male citizens probably constituted no more than 30 percent of the total adult population.[5]\nSolon (in 594 BC), Cleisthenes (in 508\u201307 BC), and Ephialtes (in 462 BC) contributed to the development of Athenian democracy.[6] Cleisthenes broke up the unlimited power of the nobility by organizing citizens into ten groups based on where they lived, rather than on their wealth.[6] The longest-lasting democratic leader was Pericles. After his death, Athenian democracy was twice briefly interrupted by oligarchic revolutions in 411 and 404 BC, towards the end of the Peloponnesian War. It was modified somewhat after it was restored under Eucleides; the most detailed accounts of the system are of this fourth-century modification, rather than the Periclean system. Democracy was suppressed by the Macedonians in 322 BC. The Athenian institutions were later revived, but how close they were to the original forms of democracy is debated.\nThe word \"democracy\" (Greek: d\u0113mokratia, \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1) combines the elements d\u00eamos (\u03b4\u1fc6\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, traditionally interpreted \"people\" or \"towns\"[7]) and kr\u00e1tos (\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, which means \"force\" or \"power\"), and thus means literally \"people power\". In the words \"monarchy\" and \"oligarchy\", the second element comes from arch\u0113 (\u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u03ae), meaning \"beginning (that which comes first)\", and hence also \"first place or power\", \"sovereignty\". One might expect, by analogy, that the term \"demarchy\" would have been adopted for the new form of government introduced by Athenian democrats. However, the word \"demarchy\" (\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03af\u03b1) had already been taken and meant \"mayoralty\", the office or rank of a high municipal magistrate. (In present-day use, the term \"demarchy\" has acquired a new meaning.)\nIt is unknown whether the word \"democracy\" was in existence when systems that came to be called democratic were first instituted. The first conceptual articulation of the term is generally accepted to be c. 470 The Suppliants (l. 604) with the line sung by the Chorus: d\u0113mou kratousa cheir (\u03b4\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b1 \u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1). This approximately translates as the \"people's hand of power\", and in the context of the play it acts as a representation of the popular requirement that the king needed to get approval from the Demos in a public assembly before taking any large decision (in this case of allowing the suppliant daughters of Danaos to take refuge in the city-state of Argos), i.e. that authority as implemented by the people in the Assembly has veto power over a king. The word is then attested in the works of Herodotus (Histories 6.43.3) in both a verbal and nominal sense with the terms d\u0113mokrateomai (\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03ad\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9) meaning \"I participate in a democracy\" and d\u0113mokratia (\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1) meaning \"democracy.\" The earlier word used for the concept is isonomia, which is indicated also in Herodotus's discussion.[8] Around 460 BC an individual is known with the name of Democrates,[9] a name possibly coined as a gesture of democratic loyalty; the name can also be found in Aeolian Temnos.[10]\nAthens was not the only polis in Ancient Greece that instituted a democratic resume. Aristotle points out other cities that adopted democratic governments. Most general accounts of the rise of democratic institutions refer mainly to Athens, since this Greek city-state's system provides a fuller historical record, including having the only complete extant \"constitution\" as compiled by Aristotle and his students in the 4th century BCE \u2013 part of a collection called Constitutions (Politeiai) .[11]\nBefore the first attempt at democratic government, Athens was ruled by a series of archons,[12] or magistrates, and the council of the Areopagus, made up of ex-archons. The members of these institutions were generally aristocrats. In 621 BC, Draco replaced the prevailing system of oral law by a written code to be enforced only by a court of law.[13][14] While the laws, later come to be known as the Draconian Constitution, were largely harsh and restrictive, with nearly all of them later being repealed, the written legal code was one of the first of its kind and considered to be one of the earliest developments of Athenian democracy.[15] In 594 BC, Solon was appointed premier archon and began issuing economic and constitutional reforms in an attempt to alleviate some of the conflict that was beginning to arise from the inequities that permeated throughout Athenian society. His reforms ultimately redefined citizenship in a way that gave each free resident of Attica a political function: Athenian citizens had the right to participate in assembly meetings. Solon sought to break away at the strong influence noble families had on the government by broadening the government's structure to include a wider range of property classes rather than just the aristocracy. His constitutional reforms included establishing four property classes: the pentakosiomedimnoi, the hippeis, the zeugitai, and the thetes.[16] The classifications were based on how many medimnoi a man's estate made per year with the pentakosiomedimnoi making at least 500 medimnoi, the hippeis making 300\u2013500 medimnoi, the zeugitai making 200\u2013300 medimnoi, and the thetes making under 200 medimnoi.[16] By granting the formerly aristocratic role to every free citizen of Athens \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Participation was open to adult, free male citizens (i.e., not a metic, woman or slave). Adult male citizens probably constituted no more than 30 percent of the total adult population.[5]\nSolon (in 594 BC), Cleisthenes (in 508\u201307 BC), and Ephialtes (in 462 BC) contributed to the development of Athenian democracy.[6] Cleisthenes broke up the unlimited power of the nobility by organizing citizens into ten groups based on where they lived, rather than on their wealth.[6] The longest-lasting democratic leader was Pericles. After his death, Athenian democracy was twice briefly interrupted by oligarchic revolutions in 411 and 404 BC, towards the end of the Peloponnesian War. It was modified somewhat after it was restored under Eucleides; the most detailed accounts of the system are of this fourth-century modification, rather than the Periclean system. Democracy was suppressed by the Macedonians in 322 BC. The Athenian institutions were later revived, but how close they were to the original forms of democracy is debated.\nThe word \"democracy\" (Greek: d\u0113mokratia, \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1) combines the elements d\u00eamos (\u03b4\u1fc6\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, traditionally interpreted \"people\" or \"towns\"[7]) and kr\u00e1tos (\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, which means \"force\" or \"power\"), and thus means literally \"people power\". In the words \"monarchy\" and \"oligarchy\", the second element comes from arch\u0113 (\u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u03ae), meaning \"beginning (that which comes first)\", and hence also \"first place or power\", \"sovereignty\". One might expect, by analogy, that the term \"demarchy\" would have been adopted for the new form of government introduced by Athenian democrats. However, the word \"demarchy\" (\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03af\u03b1) had already been taken and meant \"mayoralty\", the office or rank of a high municipal magistrate. (In present-day use, the term \"demarchy\" has acquired a new meaning.)\nIt is unknown whether the word \"democracy\" was in existence when systems that came to be called democratic were first instituted. The first conceptual articulation of the term is generally accepted to be c. 470 The Suppliants (l. 604) with the line sung by the Chorus: d\u0113mou kratousa cheir (\u03b4\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b1 \u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1). This approximately translates as the \"people's hand of power\", and in the context of the play it acts as a representation of the popular requirement that the king needed to get approval from the Demos in a public assembly before taking any large decision (in this case of allowing the suppliant daughters of Danaos to take refuge in the city-state of Argos), i.e. that authority as implemented by the people in the Assembly has veto power over a king. The word is then attested in the works of Herodotus (Histories 6.43.3) in both a verbal and nominal sense with the terms d\u0113mokrateomai (\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03ad\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9) meaning \"I participate in a democracy\" and d\u0113mokratia (\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1) meaning \"democracy.\" The earlier word used for the concept is isonomia, which is indicated also in Herodotus's discussion.[8] Around 460 BC an individual is known with the name of Democrates,[9] a name possibly coined as a gesture of democratic loyalty; the name can also be found in Aeolian Temnos.[10]\nAthens was not the only polis in Ancient Greece that instituted a democratic resume. Aristotle points out other cities that adopted democratic governments. Most general accounts of the rise of democratic institutions refer mainly to Athens, since this Greek city-state's system provides a fuller historical record, including having the only complete extant \"constitution\" as compiled by Aristotle and his students in the 4th century BCE \u2013 part of a collection called Constitutions (Politeiai) .[11]\nBefore the first attempt at democratic government, Athens was ruled by a series of archons,[12] or magistrates, and the council of the Areopagus, made up of ex-archons. The members of these institutions were generally aristocrats. In 621 BC, Draco replaced the prevailing system of oral law by a written code to be enforced only by a court of law.[13][14] While the laws, later come to be known as the Draconian Constitution, were largely harsh and restrictive, with nearly all of them later being repealed, the written legal code was one of the first of its kind and considered to be one of the earliest developments of Athenian democracy.[15] In 594 BC, Solon was appointed premier archon and began issuing economic and constitutional reforms in an attempt to alleviate some of the conflict that was beginning to arise from the inequities that permeated throughout Athenian society. His reforms ultimately redefined citizenship in a way that gave each free resident of Attica a political function: Athenian citizens had the right to participate in assembly meetings.

The UN supports democracy by promoting human rights, development, and peace and security. In the 79 years since the UN Charter was signed, the UN has done more to support democracy around the world than any other global organization. The UN promotes good governance, monitors elections, supports civil society to strengthen democratic institutions and accountability, ensures self-determination in decolonized countries, and assists in the drafting of new constitutions in post-conflict nations.\nUnited Nations activities in support of democracy are carried out through the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Democracy Fund (UNDEF), the Department of Peace Operations (DPO), the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs (DPPA), the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR),and the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women), among others.\nWhen the founders of the United Nations drafted the United Nations Charter, they did not mention the word democracy. In 1945, many of the UN Member States did not endorse democracy as a system or didn\u2019t practice it. Yet, the opening words of the Charter, \u201cWe the Peoples\u201d, reflect the fundamental principle of democracy - that the will of the people is the source of legitimacy of sovereign states and, therefore, of the United Nations as a whole.\nThe UN does not advocate for a specific model of government but promotes democratic governance as a set of values and principles that should be followed for greater participation, equality, security and human development. Democracy provides an environment that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms, and in which the freely expressed will of people is exercised. People have a say in decisions and can hold decision-makers to account. Women and men have equal rights and all people are free from discrimination\nThese values are embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It projects the concept of democracy by stating \u201cthe will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government\u201d. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights develops them even further and lays down the legal basis for the principles of democracy in international law. It covers, for instance, freedom of expression, the right of peaceful assembly, and the right to freedom of association with others. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women stipulates that its 189 contracting parties shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that women can vote and stand for elections, and participate in public life and decision-making, including at the international level.\nSince 1988, the General Assembly has adopted at least one resolution annually dealing with some aspect of democracy. In 2015, world leaders committed in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to a world in which \u201cdemocracy, good governance and the rule of law as well as an enabling environment at national and international levels, are essential for sustainable development\u201d. The Agenda reaffirmed commitments that were made earlier at the World Summit in 2005 and in the Millennium Declaration.\nThe values of freedom, respect for human rights and the principle of holding periodic and genuine elections by universal suffrage are essential elements of democracy. In turn, democracy provides an environment for the protection and effective realization of human rights.\nFor several years, the UN General Assembly and the former Commission on Human Rights endeavoured to draw on international human rights instruments to promote a common understanding of the principles and values of democracy. As a result, in 2000, the Commission recommended a series of legislative, institutional and practical measures to consolidate democracy. Moreover, in 2002, the Commission declared the following as essential elements of democracy:\nSince its establishment in 2006, the Human Rights Council (successor to the Commission) has adopted several resolutions highlighting the interdependent and mutually reinforcing relationship between democracy and human rights. Recent examples include resolutions 19/36 and 28/14 on \u201cHuman rights, democracy and the rule of law\u201d.\nDemocracy deficits, weak institutions and poor governance impose persistent challenges. The UN Human Rights office (OHCHR) and UNDP address these challenges through their advisory services and programmes. In transitional democracies and countries emerging from conflict, OHCHR assists to build strong and independent judiciary systems, parliaments, human rights institutions, and vibrant civil societies. UNDP helps governments in strengthening their public institutions, to help countries fight corruption and support inclusive participation to ensure that no one is left behind. Every year, UNDP invests, on average, US$565 million to support inclusive governance and development at the local level.\nOHCHR collaborates with national governments and other actors to rebuild public confidence and restore peace and the rule of law in post-conflict nations and transitional democracies. UN Human Rights has actively supported transitional justice programmes in more than 20 countries around the world over the past 15 years. The office tries to ensure that human rights and transitional justice considerations are reflected in peace agreements and it supports the establishment of truth-seeking processes, judicial accountability mechanisms, and reparations programmes.\nOHCHR works to guide national and regional efforts and to facilitate the discussion on democracy and human rights. In 2012, the Human Rights Council adopted a resolution titled \u201cHuman rights, democracy and the rule of law,\u201d which reaffirmed that democracy, development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms were interdependent and mutually reinforcing. Further, OHCHR published a study on challenges, lessons \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Bingham, 1854. (Gilder Leh The basic principle that governed voting in colonial America was that voters should have a \"stake in society.\" Leading colonists associated democracy with disorder and mob rule, and believed that the vote should be restricted to those who owned property or paid taxes. Only these people, in their view, were committed members of the community and were sufficiently independent to vote. Each of the thirteen colonies required voters either to own a certain amount of land or personal property, or to pay a specified amount in taxes.\nMany colonies imposed other restrictions on voting, including religious tests. Catholics were barred from voting in five colonies and Jews in four.\nThe right to vote varied widely in colonial America. In frontier areas, seventy to eighty percent of white men could vote. But in some cities, the percentage was just forty to fifty percent.\nThe American Revolution was fought in part over the issue of voting. The Revolutionaries rejected the British argument that representation in Parliament could be virtual (that is, that English members of Parliament could adequately represent the interests of the colonists). Instead, the Revolutionaries argued that government derived its legitimacy from the consent of the governed.\nThis made many restrictions on voting seem to be a violation of fundamental rights. During the period immediately following the Revolution, some states replaced property qualifications with taxpaying requirements. This reflected the principle that there should be \"no taxation without representation.\" Other states allowed anyone who served in the army or militia to vote. Vermont was the first state to eliminate all property and taxpaying qualifications for voting.\nBy 1790, all states had eliminated religious requirements for voting. As a result, approximately 60 to 70 percent of adult white men could vote. During this time, six states (Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Vermont) permitted free African Americans to vote.\nThe US Constitution left the issue of voting rights up to the states. The only thing that the Constitution said about voting was that those entitled to vote for the \"most numerous Branch of the state legislature\" could vote for members of the House of Representatives.\nDuring the first half of the nineteenth century, the election process changed dramatically. Voting by voice was replaced by voting by written ballot. This was not the same thing as a secret ballot, which was instituted only in the late nineteenth century; parties printed ballots on colored paper, so that it was still possible to determine who had voted for which candidate.\nThe most significant political innovation of the early nineteenth century was the abolition of property qualifications for voting and officeholding. Hard times resulting from the Panic of 1819 led many people to demand an end to property restrictions on voting and officeholding. In 1800, just three states (Kentucky, New Hampshire, and Vermont) had universal white manhood suffrage. By 1830, ten states permitted white manhood suffrage without qualification. Eight states restricted the vote to taxpayers, and six imposed a property qualification for suffrage. In 1860, just five states limited suffrage to taxpayers and only two still imposed property qualifications. And after 1840, a number of states, mainly in the Midwest, allowed immigrants who intended to become citizens to vote.\nPressure for expansion of voting rights came from propertyless men; from territories eager to attract settlers; and from political parties seeking to broaden their base.\nIronically, the period that saw the advent of universal white manhood suffrage also saw new restrictions imposed on voting by African Americans. Every new state that joined the Union after 1819 explicitly denied blacks the right to vote. In 1855, only five states\u2014Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont\u2014allowed African Americans to vote without significant restrictions. In 1826, only sixteen black New Yorkers were qualified to vote. The era of universal white manhood suffrage also saw other restrictions on voting. In New Jersey, the one state that had allowed women property holders to vote, women lost the right to vote. Twelve states forbade paupers from voting and two dozen states excluded felons. After 1830, interest in voting registration increased. There were also some attempts to impose literacy tests and prolonged residence requirements (ranging up to twenty-one years) in the 1850s.\nThe transition from property qualifications to universal white manhood suffrage occurred gradually, without violence and with surprisingly little dissension, except in Rhode Island, where lack of progress toward democratization provoked an episode known as the Dorr War.\nIn 1841, Rhode Island, still operating under a Royal Charter granted in 1663, restricted suffrage to landowners and their eldest sons. The charter lacked a bill of rights and grossly underrepresented growing industrial cities, such as Providence, in the state legislature. As Rhode Island grew increasingly urban and industrial, the state\u2019s landless population increased and fewer residents were eligible to vote. By 1841, just 11,239 out of 26,000 adult males were qualified to vote.\nIn 1841, Thomas W. Dorr, a Harvard-educated attorney, organized an extralegal convention to frame a new state constitution and abolish voting restrictions. The state\u2019s governor declared Dorr and his supporters guilty of insurrection, proclaimed a state of emergency, and called out the state militia. Dorr tried unsuccessfully to capture the state arsenal at Providence. He was arrested, found guilty of high treason, and sentenced to life imprisonment at hard labor. To appease popular resentment, the governor pardoned Dorr the next year, and the state adopted a new constitution in 1843. This constitution extended\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

It cleared the way for the capitalist economy to develop freely, ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nby Liberation School\nThe storming of the hated Bastille Prison during the French Revolution.\nA tale of two classes\nMore than any other revolution before the 1917 Russian Revolution, the French Revolution of 1789 inspired people across the globe to look beyond the societies in which they lived and see the possibility for social change. Even though it came after the U.S. struggle for independence from Britain, the French Revolution became \u201cthe\u201d democratic revolution.\nThe French Revolution is known for its popular slogan \u201cLiberty, Fraternity, and Equality.\u201d The old society, where every person \u201cknew their place\u201d in a hierarchy of god-given social classes, was replaced with a new one where the ideas of freedom and equality ruled.\nOf course, the rights guaranteed after the French Revolution were bourgeois democratic rights. The equality won in the revolution was formal equality, in the sense that citizens with completely different social positions had the same rights under the law. Writing over 100 years later, Anatole France summed up bourgeois equality: \u201cThe law, in its majestic equality, forbids rich and poor alike to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal their bread.\u201d\nThe French Revolution secured the political rule of the capitalist class. It cleared the way for the capitalist economy to develop freely, overpowering the restrictions of the feudal regime with its big landowning estates.\nNevertheless, later revolutionists including Karl Marx, Frederick Engels and many others studied carefully the many lessons of the French Revolution. Like any great social upheaval, all the social classes sought to influence the course of the revolution, even though the great social changes ultimately replaced one form of exploitation with another.\nPre-revolutionary France was typical of most of the countries of 18th-century Europe, although it was the largest and among the most powerful. Politically, it was ruled by an absolute monarchy headed, in 1789, by King Louis XVI. The ruling class was the landowning aristocrats who owned vast estates.\nThe Catholic Church was closely tied to the aristocracy. The church hierarchy of priests, bishops and monks formed a kind of second-level aristocracy. They also extracted goods from the peasants in the form of tithes and taxes.\nMost\u2014up to 85 percent\u2014of the 28 million people were peasants who toiled in conditions of serfdom. Most of the peasants did not own land, and so worked on the lords\u2019 estates\u2014turning over half or more of their produce to the lord in exchange for the right to live on the land.\nBy the time of the revolution, some 15 percent of the population lived in towns that grew up on the borders between feudal and royal estates. Paris was the largest city in France, with about 500,000 people, second in Europe only to London.\nThe towns were increasingly dominated by the influence of a new social class, the bourgeoisie\u2014merchants, masters and bankers, who made their living trading, as the owners of small workshops selling their goods or lending. Excluded from the feudal order, this group was small but becoming increasingly wealthy.\nThere was also a small working class. Most 18th-century French workers were craftspeople who worked in small workshops or guilds. Some worked in the textile factories, which were small by today\u2019s standards. In Paris, for example, there were about 50 factories, each employing between 100 and 800 workers.\nThe feudal ruling class did not initially have a money economy. Their livelihood was provided for by goods handed over by the peasants and serfs. Their riches came from conquests in battles near and far.\nThe money economy and the bourgeoisie grew up in this climate. The nobility was eager to buy the luxuries that the merchants had to offer. More and more, new weapons for the nobles\u2019 wars had to be bought from craftspeople\u2014with money lent from the merchant capitalists and bankers.\nBut the growth of this new capitalist class, the bourgeoisie, was hampered by the feudal social order. To trade, the merchants needed to travel. That meant crossing the boundaries of many feudal estates, maybe the size of a county today. But at each crossing, merchants had to pay tolls and taxes to the landowning lords. Crossing bridges meant more tolls.\nIt was becoming more and more apparent to this merchant class: Feudalism was an extremely inefficient and backward social system.\nTwo factors fueled the social crisis that opened the door for revolution. During the decade leading up to the revolution, France underwent the worst agricultural crisis in almost 100 years. Main staple crops like wheat consistently produced record-poor yields, followed in turn by poor harvests in nearly every other agricultural product.\nFamine was rampant in the countryside, making its way into the developing urban centers. In 1787, a severe drought in the summer and fall compounded the problem.\nPeasant rebellions were common. In 1788, the uprisings reached Paris, when unemployed workers joined the ranks of the uprisings. In the 18 months leading up to the revolution, there were at least 200 food riots recorded across France. Crowds descended on wealthy properties or places where public records of taxes, deeds and debts were held. Money was re-appropriated. Records of taxes or debts were thrown out of office windows and scattered into the streets below.\nThe second factor driving the crisis facing Louis XVI\u2019s regime was its attempt to raise taxes to pay for France\u2019s recent wars in Europe and its military aid to the rebelling British colonies in North America, now the United States. To pay its debts in the midst of the economic crisis, the monarchy tried to impose taxes on all classes, including the nobles, clergy and the new bourgeoisie.\nAs a way to co-opt the wealthy classes into bearing the burden by paying taxes, the king tried to convene various meetings of the nobles, the clergy and the new bourgeoisie. An \u201cAssembly of Notables\u201d chosen by the king in 1787 tried\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Each year 500 names were chosen from all the citizens of ancient Athens.\n\nFull Page Content:\nAthenian democracy developed around the 6th century BC in the Greek city-state (known as a polis) of Athens, comprising the city of Athens and the surrounding territory of Attica, and focusing on supporting liberty, equality, and security.[1] Although Athens is the most familiar of the democratic city-states in ancient Greece, it was not the only one, nor was it the first; multiple other city-states adopted similar democratic constitutions before Athens.[2][3] By the late 4th century BC, as many as half of the over one thousand existing Greek cities might have been democracies.[4] Athens practiced a political system of legislation and executive bills. Participation was open to adult, free male citizens (i.e., not a metic, woman or slave). Adult male citizens probably constituted no more than 30 percent of the total adult population.[5]\nSolon (in 594 BC), Cleisthenes (in 508\u201307 BC), and Ephialtes (in 462 BC) contributed to the development of Athenian democracy.[6] Cleisthenes broke up the unlimited power of the nobility by organizing citizens into ten groups based on where they lived, rather than on their wealth.[6] The longest-lasting democratic leader was Pericles. After his death, Athenian democracy was twice briefly interrupted by oligarchic revolutions in 411 and 404 BC, towards the end of the Peloponnesian War. It was modified somewhat after it was restored under Eucleides; the most detailed accounts of the system are of this fourth-century modification, rather than the Periclean system. Democracy was suppressed by the Macedonians in 322 BC. The Athenian institutions were later revived, but how close they were to the original forms of democracy is debated.\nThe word \"democracy\" (Greek: d\u0113mokratia, \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1) combines the elements d\u00eamos (\u03b4\u1fc6\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, traditionally interpreted \"people\" or \"towns\"[7]) and kr\u00e1tos (\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, which means \"force\" or \"power\"), and thus means literally \"people power\". In the words \"monarchy\" and \"oligarchy\", the second element comes from arch\u0113 (\u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u03ae), meaning \"beginning (that which comes first)\", and hence also \"first place or power\", \"sovereignty\". One might expect, by analogy, that the term \"demarchy\" would have been adopted for the new form of government introduced by Athenian democrats. However, the word \"demarchy\" (\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03af\u03b1) had already been taken and meant \"mayoralty\", the office or rank of a high municipal magistrate. (In present-day use, the term \"demarchy\" has acquired a new meaning.)\nIt is unknown whether the word \"democracy\" was in existence when systems that came to be called democratic were first instituted. The first conceptual articulation of the term is generally accepted to be c. 470 The Suppliants (l. 604) with the line sung by the Chorus: d\u0113mou kratousa cheir (\u03b4\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b1 \u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1). This approximately translates as the \"people's hand of power\", and in the context of the play it acts as a representation of the popular requirement that the king needed to get approval from the Demos in a public assembly before taking any large decision (in this case of allowing the suppliant daughters of Danaos to take refuge in the city-state of Argos), i.e. that authority as implemented by the people in the Assembly has veto power over a king. The word is then attested in the works of Herodotus (Histories 6.43.3) in both a verbal and nominal sense with the terms d\u0113mokrateomai (\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03ad\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9) meaning \"I participate in a democracy\" and d\u0113mokratia (\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1) meaning \"democracy.\" The earlier word used for the concept is isonomia, which is indicated also in Herodotus's discussion.[8] Around 460 BC an individual is known with the name of Democrates,[9] a name possibly coined as a gesture of democratic loyalty; the name can also be found in Aeolian Temnos.[10]\nAthens was not the only polis in Ancient Greece that instituted a democratic resume. Aristotle points out other cities that adopted democratic governments. Most general accounts of the rise of democratic institutions refer mainly to Athens, since this Greek city-state's system provides a fuller historical record, including having the only complete extant \"constitution\" as compiled by Aristotle and his students in the 4th century BCE \u2013 part of a collection called Constitutions (Politeiai) .[11]\nBefore the first attempt at democratic government, Athens was ruled by a series of archons,[12] or magistrates, and the council of the Areopagus, made up of ex-archons. The members of these institutions were generally aristocrats. In 621 BC, Draco replaced the prevailing system of oral law by a written code to be enforced only by a court of law.[13][14] While the laws, later come to be known as the Draconian Constitution, were largely harsh and restrictive, with nearly all of them later being repealed, the written legal code was one of the first of its kind and considered to be one of the earliest developments of Athenian democracy.[15] In 594 BC, Solon was appointed premier archon and began issuing economic and constitutional reforms in an attempt to alleviate some of the conflict that was beginning to arise from the inequities that permeated throughout Athenian society. His reforms ultimately redefined citizenship in a way that gave each free resident of Attica a political function: Athenian citizens had the right to participate in assembly meetings. Solon sought to break away at the strong influence noble families had on the government by broadening the government's structure to include a wider range of property classes rather than just the aristocracy. His constitutional reforms included establishing four property classes: the pentakosiomedimnoi, the hippeis, the zeugitai, and the thetes.[16] The classifications were based on how many medimnoi a man's estate made per year with the pentakosiomedimnoi making at least 500 medimnoi, the hippeis making 300\u2013500 medimnoi, the zeugitai making 200\u2013300 medimnoi, and the thetes making under 200 medimnoi.[16] By granting the formerly aristocratic role to every free citizen of Athens \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Democratic government is commonly juxtaposed with oligarchic and monarchic systems, which are ruled by a minority and a sole monarch respectively.\nDemocracy is generally associated[vague] with the efforts of the ancient Greeks, whom 18th-century intellectuals such as Montesquieu considered the founders of Western civilization. These individuals attempted to leverage these early democratic experiments into a new template for post-monarchical political organization.[3][page needed] The extent to which these 18th-century democratic revivalists succeeded in turning the democratic ideals of the ancient Greeks into the dominant political institution of the next 300 years is hardly debatable, even if the moral justifications they often employed might be. Nevertheless, the critical historical juncture catalyzed by the resurrection of democratic ideals and institutions fundamentally transformed the ensuing centuries and has dominated the international landscape since the dismantling of the final vestige of the British Empire following the end of the Second World War.\nModern representative democracies attempt to bridge the gap between Rousseau's depiction of the state of nature and Hobbes's depiction of society as inevitably authoritarian through 'social contracts' that enshrine the rights of the citizens, curtail the power of the state, and grant agency through the right to vote.[4]\nAnthropologists have identified forms of proto-democracy that date back to small bands of hunter-gatherers that predate the establishment of agrarian, sedentary societies and still exist virtually unchanged[disputed \u2013 discuss] in isolated indigenous groups today. In these groups of generally 50\u2013100 individuals, often tied closely by familial bonds, decisions are reached by consensus or majority and many times without the designation of any specific chief.[4]\nThese types of democracy are commonly identified as tribalism, or primitive democracy. In this sense, a primitive democracy usually takes shape in small communities or villages when there are face-to-face discussions in a village, council or with a leader who has the backing of village elders or other cooperative forms of government.[5][verification needed] This becomes more complex on a larger scale, such as when the village and city are examined more broadly as political communities. All other forms of rule \u2013 including monarchy, tyranny, aristocracy, and oligarchy \u2013 have flourished in more urban centers, often those with concentrated populations.[6][verification needed][disputed \u2013 discuss] David Graeber and David Wengrow, in The Dawn of Everything, argue in contrast that cities and early settlements were more varied and unpredictable in terms of how their political systems alternated and evolved from more to less democratic.[7]\nThe concepts (and name) of democracy and constitution as a form of government originated in ancient Athens in the sixth-century BC (circa 508 BC). In ancient Greece, where there were many city-states with different forms of government, democracy (\"rule by the demos\", i.e. citizen body) was contrasted with governance by elites (aristocracy, literally \"rule by the best\"), by one person (monarchy), by tyrants (tyranny), etc.\nAlthough fifth-century BC Athens is widely considered to have been the first state to develop a sophisticated system of rule that we today call democracy,[8][9][10][11][12][13] in recent decades scholars have explored the possibility that advancements toward democratic government occurred independently in the Near East, the Indian subcontinent, and elsewhere before this.[14]\nStudying pre-Babylonian Mesopotamia, Thorkild Jacobsen used Sumerian epic, myth, and historical records to identify what he has called primitive democracy. By this, Jacobsen means a government in which ultimate power rests with the mass of free (non-slave) male citizens, although \"the various functions of government are as yet little specialised [and] the power structure is loose\". In early Sumer, kings like Gilgamesh did not hold the autocratic power that later Mesopotamian rulers wielded. Rather, major city-states functioned with councils of elders and \"young men\" (likely free men bearing arms) that possessed the final political authority, and had to be consulted on all major issues such as war.[15][16]\nThe work has gained little outright acceptance. Scholars criticize the use of the word \"democracy\" in this context since the same evidence also can be interpreted to demonstrate a power struggle between primitive monarchy and noble classes, a struggle in which the common people function more like pawns rather than any kind of sovereign authority.[17] Jacobsen conceded that the vagueness of the evidence prohibits the separation between the Mesopotamian democracy from a primitive oligarchy.[18]\nThe practice of \"governing by assembly\" was at least part of how ancient Phoenicians made important decisions. One source is the story of Wen-Amon, an Egyptian trader who travelled north to the Phoenician city of Byblos around 1100 BC to trade for Phoenician lumber. After loading his lumber, a group of pirates surrounded Wen-Amon and his cargo ship. The Phoenician prince of Byblos was called in to fix the problem, whereupon he summoned his mw-'dwt, an old Semitic word meaning assembly, to reach a decision. This shows that Byblos was ruled in part by a popular assembly (drawn from what subpopulation and equipped with exactly what power is not known exactly).[19]\nSeveral forms of proto-democratic governance als\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

These programs aim at improving the preparation of kids for living and acting in a democracy. These initiatives often present a dimension of neutrality, defense of plurality and individual freedom, without presenting interpellations or ideological guidelines.\nTo answer such questions, we analyzed in detail the case of Politize! \u2013 Civic Education Institute, a Brazilian civil society organization dedicated to strengthening democracy in the country through content, training, and campaigns. Since 2018, Politize! has run the \u201cAmbassadors\u201d program, which targets young Brazilians, and develops educational and practical activities to train civic leaders to solve public problems. The program has trained over 2,000 leaders from multiple municipalities across the territory and is helping advance a democratic culture throughout the country.\nIn our analysis, civil society organizations engaged with local leaders may act as complementors to \u201ctraditional\u201d forms of civic education. This way, programs and projects in that regard may be complementary instruments to promote reflection and assimilation of democratic values and attitudes. Also, the recent political landscape in Brazil has been characterized by a lack of trust in politicians and political parties, hate discourse, and systematic mis and disinformation propagated through social media. The complexity of this context allows us to extract lessons learned from a successful case and to sound a call for action to other organizations across the globe to contribute to the formation of the next generation of civic leaders.\nPolitical (dis)engagement in Brazil\nBrazil struggles with a high degree of political disengagement, especially among young people, which leads to political apathy and disbelief in institutions, as demonstrated by studies of different institutions. For instance, a recent survey1 carried out with more than a thousand young Brazilians showed that about twenty percent of them did not understand the concept of democracy, and more than half of those interviewed said they did not trust political parties. Furthermore, the study also indicated that none of the official institutions of the Brazilian state exceed 50 percent trust among those interviewed. Adding to this lack of trust is a level of political polarization that discourages people from engaging in conversations with those who hold different views\u2014a situation that particularly affects younger individuals.\nThis persistent distrust that young people have in political institutions does not necessarily mean a lack of adherence or commitment to democratic values. As we argue, the political engagement of today\u2019s younger generation (the so-called \u201cGen Z\u201d) could be characterized as engaged skepticism.2 In other words, a skeptical perception towards parties and professional politicians due to their distance from citizens\u2019 real problems, coupled with an attitude of engagement in local and immediate issues.\nSo how can society benefit from this positive (though skeptical) attitude and engage youngsters in civic participation? The way we understand the situation, young people should be better informed and prepared with the right tools to exercise their citizenship, which is what formal education programs on topics related to politics and citizenship aim to promote.\nIntegrating civic education into formal school curricula\nThe relationship between formal education and political participation is perhaps one of the best-established relationships that exists in the field of political behavior. It is generally argued that with more formal education comes a greater interest in politics, a greater concern with elections, a greater confidence in carrying out one\u2019s role as a citizen, and so on.\nFor these reasons, there has been a notable growth in the interest of new approaches to civic education around the world since the last decade of the twentieth century. This interest has taken many forms, including program implementations, research projects, policy plans, and the development of important resources and curriculum initiatives for schools to meet the need for a new and more effective educational approach to democratic citizenship. This entire movement was due to the reported decline in the rate of active participation of citizens in civic life. Consequently, many Western democracies carried out analyses and research projects that subsequently inspired curriculum initiatives that reflected a new approach to civic education and citizenship for schools.\nGenerally, these educational programs have been centered on three aspects: (1) political knowledge, (2) civic participation, and (3) strengthening democratic values. What is generally suggested is that the school should work on the themes of civic education through democratic practices governed by criteria of equality, freedom, and justice. The objective would, therefore, be to prepare young people to adopt democratic ideas and habits, teaching them how to participate in civic life, and how to make autonomous and informed decisions. This would encourage self-reflection and foster an understanding of both individual and collective interests, emphasizing the importance of maintaining consistent opinions on significant issues over time. It would also enhance civic knowledge about the functioning of institutions, strengthen support for democratic values, increase trust in public life, and more.\nCivil society organizations (CSOs) have also been invited to part\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The complexity of this context allows us to extract lessons learned from a successful case and to sound a call for action to other organizations across the globe to contribute to the formation of the next generation of civic leaders.\nPolitical (dis)engagement in Brazil\nBrazil struggles with a high degree of political disengagement, especially among young people, which leads to political apathy and disbelief in institutions, as demonstrated by studies of different institutions. For instance, a recent survey1 carried out with more than a thousand young Brazilians showed that about twenty percent of them did not understand the concept of democracy, and more than half of those interviewed said they did not trust political parties. Furthermore, the study also indicated that none of the official institutions of the Brazilian state exceed 50 percent trust among those interviewed. Adding to this lack of trust is a level of political polarization that discourages people from engaging in conversations with those who hold different views\u2014a situation that particularly affects younger individuals.\nThis persistent distrust that young people have in political institutions does not necessarily mean a lack of adherence or commitment to democratic values. As we argue, the political engagement of today\u2019s younger generation (the so-called \u201cGen Z\u201d) could be characterized as engaged skepticism.2 In other words, a skeptical perception towards parties and professional politicians due to their distance from citizens\u2019 real problems, coupled with an attitude of engagement in local and immediate issues.\nSo how can society benefit from this positive (though skeptical) attitude and engage youngsters in civic participation? The way we understand the situation, young people should be better informed and prepared with the right tools to exercise their citizenship, which is what formal education programs on topics related to politics and citizenship aim to promote.\nIntegrating civic education into formal school curricula\nThe relationship between formal education and political participation is perhaps one of the best-established relationships that exists in the field of political behavior. It is generally argued that with more formal education comes a greater interest in politics, a greater concern with elections, a greater confidence in carrying out one\u2019s role as a citizen, and so on.\nFor these reasons, there has been a notable growth in the interest of new approaches to civic education around the world since the last decade of the twentieth century. This interest has taken many forms, including program implementations, research projects, policy plans, and the development of important resources and curriculum initiatives for schools to meet the need for a new and more effective educational approach to democratic citizenship. This entire movement was due to the reported decline in the rate of active participation of citizens in civic life. Consequently, many Western democracies carried out analyses and research projects that subsequently inspired curriculum initiatives that reflected a new approach to civic education and citizenship for schools.\nGenerally, these educational programs have been centered on three aspects: (1) political knowledge, (2) civic participation, and (3) strengthening democratic values. What is generally suggested is that the school should work on the themes of civic education through democratic practices governed by criteria of equality, freedom, and justice. The objective would, therefore, be to prepare young people to adopt democratic ideas and habits, teaching them how to participate in civic life, and how to make autonomous and informed decisions. This would encourage self-reflection and foster an understanding of both individual and collective interests, emphasizing the importance of maintaining consistent opinions on significant issues over time. It would also enhance civic knowledge about the functioning of institutions, strengthen support for democratic values, increase trust in public life, and more.\nCivil society organizations (CSOs) have also been invited to part\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Democratic government is commonly juxtaposed with oligarchic and monarchic systems, which are ruled by a minority and a sole monarch respectively.\nDemocracy is generally associated[vague] with the efforts of the ancient Greeks, whom 18th-century intellectuals such as Montesquieu considered the founders of Western civilization. These individuals attempted to leverage these early democratic experiments into a new template for post-monarchical political organization.[3][page needed] The extent to which these 18th-century democratic revivalists succeeded in turning the democratic ideals of the ancient Greeks into the dominant political institution of the next 300 years is hardly debatable, even if the moral justifications they often employed might be. Nevertheless, the critical historical juncture catalyzed by the resurrection of democratic ideals and institutions fundamentally transformed the ensuing centuries and has dominated the international landscape since the dismantling of the final vestige of the British Empire following the end of the Second World War.\nModern representative democracies attempt to bridge the gap between Rousseau's depiction of the state of nature and Hobbes's depiction of society as inevitably authoritarian through 'social contracts' that enshrine the rights of the citizens, curtail the power of the state, and grant agency through the right to vote.[4]\nAnthropologists have identified forms of proto-democracy that date back to small bands of hunter-gatherers that predate the establishment of agrarian, sedentary societies and still exist virtually unchanged[disputed \u2013 discuss] in isolated indigenous groups today. In these groups of generally 50\u2013100 individuals, often tied closely by familial bonds, decisions are reached by consensus or majority and many times without the designation of any specific chief.[4]\nThese types of democracy are commonly identified as tribalism, or primitive democracy. In this sense, a primitive democracy usually takes shape in small communities or villages when there are face-to-face discussions in a village, council or with a leader who has the backing of village elders or other cooperative forms of government.[5][verification needed] This becomes more complex on a larger scale, such as when the village and city are examined more broadly as political communities. All other forms of rule \u2013 including monarchy, tyranny, aristocracy, and oligarchy \u2013 have flourished in more urban centers, often those with concentrated populations.[6][verification needed][disputed \u2013 discuss] David Graeber and David Wengrow, in The Dawn of Everything, argue in contrast that cities and early settlements were more varied and unpredictable in terms of how their political systems alternated and evolved from more to less democratic.[7]\nThe concepts (and name) of democracy and constitution as a form of government originated in ancient Athens in the sixth-century BC (circa 508 BC). In ancient Greece, where there were many city-states with different forms of government, democracy (\"rule by the demos\", i.e. citizen body) was contrasted with governance by elites (aristocracy, literally \"rule by the best\"), by one person (monarchy), by tyrants (tyranny), etc.\nAlthough fifth-century BC Athens is widely considered to have been the first state to develop a sophisticated system of rule that we today call democracy,[8][9][10][11][12][13] in recent decades scholars have explored the possibility that advancements toward democratic government occurred independently in the Near East, the Indian subcontinent, and elsewhere before this.[14]\nStudying pre-Babylonian Mesopotamia, Thorkild Jacobsen used Sumerian epic, myth, and historical records to identify what he has called primitive democracy. By this, Jacobsen means a government in which ultimate power rests with the mass of free (non-slave) male citizens, although \"the various functions of government are as yet little specialised [and] the power structure is loose\". In early Sumer, kings like Gilgamesh did not hold the autocratic power that later Mesopotamian rulers wielded. Rather, major city-states functioned with councils of elders and \"young men\" (likely free men bearing arms) that possessed the final political authority, and had to be consulted on all major issues such as war.[15][16]\nThe work has gained little outright acceptance. Scholars criticize the use of the word \"democracy\" in this context since the same evidence also can be interpreted to demonstrate a power struggle between primitive monarchy and noble classes, a struggle in which the common people function more like pawns rather than any kind of sovereign authority.[17] Jacobsen conceded that the vagueness of the evidence prohibits the separation between the Mesopotamian democracy from a primitive oligarchy.[18]\nThe practice of \"governing by assembly\" was at least part of how ancient Phoenicians made important decisions. One source is the story of Wen-Amon, an Egyptian trader who travelled north to the Phoenician city of Byblos around 1100 BC to trade for Phoenician lumber. After loading his lumber, a group of pirates surrounded Wen-Amon and his cargo ship. The Phoenician prince of Byblos was called in to fix the problem, whereupon he summoned his mw-'dwt, an old Semitic word meaning assembly, to reach a decision. This shows that Byblos was ruled in part by a popular assembly (drawn from what subpopulation and equipped with exactly what power is not known exactly).[19]\nSeveral forms of proto-democratic governance als\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Since 2018, Politize! has run the \u201cAmbassadors\u201d program, which targets young Brazilians, and develops educational and practical activities to train civic leaders to solve public problems.

Participation was open to adult, free male citizens (i.e., not a metic, woman or slave). Adult male citizens probably constituted no more than 30 percent of the total adult population.[5]\nSolon (in 594 BC), Cleisthenes (in 508\u201307 BC), and Ephialtes (in 462 BC) contributed to the development of Athenian democracy.[6] Cleisthenes broke up the unlimited power of the nobility by organizing citizens into ten groups based on where they lived, rather than on their wealth.[6] The longest-lasting democratic leader was Pericles. After his death, Athenian democracy was twice briefly interrupted by oligarchic revolutions in 411 and 404 BC, towards the end of the Peloponnesian War. It was modified somewhat after it was restored under Eucleides; the most detailed accounts of the system are of this fourth-century modification, rather than the Periclean system. Democracy was suppressed by the Macedonians in 322 BC. The Athenian institutions were later revived, but how close they were to the original forms of democracy is debated.\nThe word \"democracy\" (Greek: d\u0113mokratia, \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1) combines the elements d\u00eamos (\u03b4\u1fc6\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, traditionally interpreted \"people\" or \"towns\"[7]) and kr\u00e1tos (\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, which means \"force\" or \"power\"), and thus means literally \"people power\". In the words \"monarchy\" and \"oligarchy\", the second element comes from arch\u0113 (\u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u03ae), meaning \"beginning (that which comes first)\", and hence also \"first place or power\", \"sovereignty\". One might expect, by analogy, that the term \"demarchy\" would have been adopted for the new form of government introduced by Athenian democrats. However, the word \"demarchy\" (\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03af\u03b1) had already been taken and meant \"mayoralty\", the office or rank of a high municipal magistrate. (In present-day use, the term \"demarchy\" has acquired a new meaning.)\nIt is unknown whether the word \"democracy\" was in existence when systems that came to be called democratic were first instituted. The first conceptual articulation of the term is generally accepted to be c. 470 The Suppliants (l. 604) with the line sung by the Chorus: d\u0113mou kratousa cheir (\u03b4\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b1 \u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1). This approximately translates as the \"people's hand of power\", and in the context of the play it acts as a representation of the popular requirement that the king needed to get approval from the Demos in a public assembly before taking any large decision (in this case of allowing the suppliant daughters of Danaos to take refuge in the city-state of Argos), i.e. that authority as implemented by the people in the Assembly has veto power over a king. The word is then attested in the works of Herodotus (Histories 6.43.3) in both a verbal and nominal sense with the terms d\u0113mokrateomai (\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03ad\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9) meaning \"I participate in a democracy\" and d\u0113mokratia (\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1) meaning \"democracy.\" The earlier word used for the concept is isonomia, which is indicated also in Herodotus's discussion.[8] Around 460 BC an individual is known with the name of Democrates,[9] a name possibly coined as a gesture of democratic loyalty; the name can also be found in Aeolian Temnos.[10]\nAthens was not the only polis in Ancient Greece that instituted a democratic resume. Aristotle points out other cities that adopted democratic governments. Most general accounts of the rise of democratic institutions refer mainly to Athens, since this Greek city-state's system provides a fuller historical record, including having the only complete extant \"constitution\" as compiled by Aristotle and his students in the 4th century BCE \u2013 part of a collection called Constitutions (Politeiai) .[11]\nBefore the first attempt at democratic government, Athens was ruled by a series of archons,[12] or magistrates, and the council of the Areopagus, made up of ex-archons. The members of these institutions were generally aristocrats. In 621 BC, Draco replaced the prevailing system of oral law by a written code to be enforced only by a court of law.[13][14] While the laws, later come to be known as the Draconian Constitution, were largely harsh and restrictive, with nearly all of them later being repealed, the written legal code was one of the first of its kind and considered to be one of the earliest developments of Athenian democracy.[15] In 594 BC, Solon was appointed premier archon and began issuing economic and constitutional reforms in an attempt to alleviate some of the conflict that was beginning to arise from the inequities that permeated throughout Athenian society. His reforms ultimately redefined citizenship in a way that gave each free resident of Attica a political function: Athenian citizens had the right to participate in assembly meetings. Solon sought to break away at the strong influence noble families had on the government by broadening the government's structure to include a wider range of property classes rather than just the aristocracy. His constitutional reforms included establishing four property classes: the pentakosiomedimnoi, the hippeis, the zeugitai, and the thetes.[16] The classifications were based on how many medimnoi a man's estate made per year with the pentakosiomedimnoi making at least 500 medimnoi, the hippeis making 300\u2013500 medimnoi, the zeugitai making 200\u2013300 medimnoi, and the thetes making under 200 medimnoi.[16] By granting the formerly aristocratic role to every free citizen of Athens \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The Athenian institutions were later revived, but how close they were to the original forms of democracy is debated.\nThe word \"democracy\" (Greek: d\u0113mokratia, \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1) combines the elements d\u00eamos (\u03b4\u1fc6\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, traditionally interpreted \"people\" or \"towns\"[7]) and kr\u00e1tos (\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, which means \"force\" or \"power\"), and thus means literally \"people power\". In the words \"monarchy\" and \"oligarchy\", the second element comes from arch\u0113 (\u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u03ae), meaning \"beginning (that which comes first)\", and hence also \"first place or power\", \"sovereignty\". One might expect, by analogy, that the term \"demarchy\" would have been adopted for the new form of government introduced by Athenian democrats. However, the word \"demarchy\" (\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03af\u03b1) had already been taken and meant \"mayoralty\", the office or rank of a high municipal magistrate. (In present-day use, the term \"demarchy\" has acquired a new meaning.)\nIt is unknown whether the word \"democracy\" was in existence when systems that came to be called democratic were first instituted. The first conceptual articulation of the term is generally accepted to be c. 470 The Suppliants (l. 604) with the line sung by the Chorus: d\u0113mou kratousa cheir (\u03b4\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b1 \u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1). This approximately translates as the \"people's hand of power\", and in the context of the play it acts as a representation of the popular requirement that the king needed to get approval from the Demos in a public assembly before taking any large decision (in this case of allowing the suppliant daughters of Danaos to take refuge in the city-state of Argos), i.e. that authority as implemented by the people in the Assembly has veto power over a king. The word is then attested in the works of Herodotus (Histories 6.43.3) in both a verbal and nominal sense with the terms d\u0113mokrateomai (\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03ad\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9) meaning \"I participate in a democracy\" and d\u0113mokratia (\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1) meaning \"democracy.\" The earlier word used for the concept is isonomia, which is indicated also in Herodotus's discussion.[8] Around 460 BC an individual is known with the name of Democrates,[9] a name possibly coined as a gesture of democratic loyalty; the name can also be found in Aeolian Temnos.[10]\nAthens was not the only polis in Ancient Greece that instituted a democratic resume. Aristotle points out other cities that adopted democratic governments. Most general accounts of the rise of democratic institutions refer mainly to Athens, since this Greek city-state's system provides a fuller historical record, including having the only complete extant \"constitution\" as compiled by Aristotle and his students in the 4th century BCE \u2013 part of a collection called Constitutions (Politeiai) .[11]\nBefore the first attempt at democratic government, Athens was ruled by a series of archons,[12] or magistrates, and the council of the Areopagus, made up of ex-archons. The members of these institutions were generally aristocrats. In 621 BC, Draco replaced the prevailing system of oral law by a written code to be enforced only by a court of law.[13][14] While the laws, later come to be known as the Draconian Constitution, were largely harsh and restrictive, with nearly all of them later being repealed, the written legal code was one of the first of its kind and considered to be one of the earliest developments of Athenian democracy.[15] In 594 BC, Solon was appointed premier archon and began issuing economic and constitutional reforms in an attempt to alleviate some of the conflict that was beginning to arise from the inequities that permeated throughout Athenian society. His reforms ultimately redefined citizenship in a way that gave each free resident of Attica a political function: Athenian citizens had the right to participate in assembly meetings. Solon sought to break away at the strong influence noble families had on the government by broadening the government's structure to include a wider range of property classes rather than just the aristocracy. His constitutional reforms included establishing four property classes: the pentakosiomedimnoi, the hippeis, the zeugitai, and the thetes.[16] The classifications were based on how many medimnoi a man's estate made per year with the pentakosiomedimnoi making at least 500 medimnoi, the hippeis making 300\u2013500 medimnoi, the zeugitai making 200\u2013300 medimnoi, and the thetes making under 200 medimnoi.[16] By granting the formerly aristocratic role to every free citizen of Athens \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Democratic government is commonly juxtaposed with oligarchic and monarchic systems, which are ruled by a minority and a sole monarch respectively.\nDemocracy is generally associated[vague] with the efforts of the ancient Greeks, whom 18th-century intellectuals such as Montesquieu considered the founders of Western civilization. These individuals attempted to leverage these early democratic experiments into a new template for post-monarchical political organization.[3][page needed] The extent to which these 18th-century democratic revivalists succeeded in turning the democratic ideals of the ancient Greeks into the dominant political institution of the next 300 years is hardly debatable, even if the moral justifications they often employed might be. Nevertheless, the critical historical juncture catalyzed by the resurrection of democratic ideals and institutions fundamentally transformed the ensuing centuries and has dominated the international landscape since the dismantling of the final vestige of the British Empire following the end of the Second World War.\nModern representative democracies attempt to bridge the gap between Rousseau's depiction of the state of nature and Hobbes's depiction of society as inevitably authoritarian through 'social contracts' that enshrine the rights of the citizens, curtail the power of the state, and grant agency through the right to vote.[4]\nAnthropologists have identified forms of proto-democracy that date back to small bands of hunter-gatherers that predate the establishment of agrarian, sedentary societies and still exist virtually unchanged[disputed \u2013 discuss] in isolated indigenous groups today. In these groups of generally 50\u2013100 individuals, often tied closely by familial bonds, decisions are reached by consensus or majority and many times without the designation of any specific chief.[4]\nThese types of democracy are commonly identified as tribalism, or primitive democracy. In this sense, a primitive democracy usually takes shape in small communities or villages when there are face-to-face discussions in a village, council or with a leader who has the backing of village elders or other cooperative forms of government.[5][verification needed] This becomes more complex on a larger scale, such as when the village and city are examined more broadly as political communities. All other forms of rule \u2013 including monarchy, tyranny, aristocracy, and oligarchy \u2013 have flourished in more urban centers, often those with concentrated populations.[6][verification needed][disputed \u2013 discuss] David Graeber and David Wengrow, in The Dawn of Everything, argue in contrast that cities and early settlements were more varied and unpredictable in terms of how their political systems alternated and evolved from more to less democratic.[7]\nThe concepts (and name) of democracy and constitution as a form of government originated in ancient Athens in the sixth-century BC (circa 508 BC). In ancient Greece, where there were many city-states with different forms of government, democracy (\"rule by the demos\", i.e. citizen body) was contrasted with governance by elites (aristocracy, literally \"rule by the best\"), by one person (monarchy), by tyrants (tyranny), etc.\nAlthough fifth-century BC Athens is widely considered to have been the first state to develop a sophisticated system of rule that we today call democracy,[8][9][10][11][12][13] in recent decades scholars have explored the possibility that advancements toward democratic government occurred independently in the Near East, the Indian subcontinent, and elsewhere before this.[14]\nStudying pre-Babylonian Mesopotamia, Thorkild Jacobsen used Sumerian epic, myth, and historical records to identify what he has called primitive democracy. By this, Jacobsen means a government in which ultimate power rests with the mass of free (non-slave) male citizens, although \"the various functions of government are as yet little specialised [and] the power structure is loose\". In early Sumer, kings like Gilgamesh did not hold the autocratic power that later Mesopotamian rulers wielded. Rather, major city-states functioned with councils of elders and \"young men\" (likely free men bearing arms) that possessed the final political authority, and had to be consulted on all major issues such as war.[15][16]\nThe work has gained little outright acceptance. Scholars criticize the use of the word \"democracy\" in this context since the same evidence also can be interpreted to demonstrate a power struggle between primitive monarchy and noble classes, a struggle in which the common people function more like pawns rather than any kind of sovereign authority.[17] Jacobsen conceded that the vagueness of the evidence prohibits the separation between the Mesopotamian democracy from a primitive oligarchy.[18]\nThe practice of \"governing by assembly\" was at least part of how ancient Phoenicians made important decisions. One source is the story of Wen-Amon, an Egyptian trader who travelled north to the Phoenician city of Byblos around 1100 BC to trade for Phoenician lumber. After loading his lumber, a group of pirates surrounded Wen-Amon and his cargo ship. The Phoenician prince of Byblos was called in to fix the problem, whereupon he summoned his mw-'dwt, an old Semitic word meaning assembly, to reach a decision. This shows that Byblos was ruled in part by a popular assembly (drawn from what subpopulation and equipped with exactly what power is not known exactly).[19]\nSeveral forms of proto-democratic governance als\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

These programs aim at improving the preparation of kids for living and acting in a democracy. These initiatives often present a dimension of neutrality, defense of plurality and individual freedom, without presenting interpellations or ideological guidelines.\nTo answer such questions, we analyzed in detail the case of Politize! \u2013 Civic Education Institute, a Brazilian civil society organization dedicated to strengthening democracy in the country through content, training, and campaigns. Since 2018, Politize! has run the \u201cAmbassadors\u201d program, which targets young Brazilians, and develops educational and practical activities to train civic leaders to solve public problems. The program has trained over 2,000 leaders from multiple municipalities across the territory and is helping advance a democratic culture throughout the country.\nIn our analysis, civil society organizations engaged with local leaders may act as complementors to \u201ctraditional\u201d forms of civic education. This way, programs and projects in that regard may be complementary instruments to promote reflection and assimilation of democratic values and attitudes. Also, the recent political landscape in Brazil has been characterized by a lack of trust in politicians and political parties, hate discourse, and systematic mis and disinformation propagated through social media. The complexity of this context allows us to extract lessons learned from a successful case and to sound a call for action to other organizations across the globe to contribute to the formation of the next generation of civic leaders.\nPolitical (dis)engagement in Brazil\nBrazil struggles with a high degree of political disengagement, especially among young people, which leads to political apathy and disbelief in institutions, as demonstrated by studies of different institutions. For instance, a recent survey1 carried out with more than a thousand young Brazilians showed that about twenty percent of them did not understand the concept of democracy, and more than half of those interviewed said they did not trust political parties. Furthermore, the study also indicated that none of the official institutions of the Brazilian state exceed 50 percent trust among those interviewed. Adding to this lack of trust is a level of political polarization that discourages people from engaging in conversations with those who hold different views\u2014a situation that particularly affects younger individuals.\nThis persistent distrust that young people have in political institutions does not necessarily mean a lack of adherence or commitment to democratic values. As we argue, the political engagement of today\u2019s younger generation (the so-called \u201cGen Z\u201d) could be characterized as engaged skepticism.2 In other words, a skeptical perception towards parties and professional politicians due to their distance from citizens\u2019 real problems, coupled with an attitude of engagement in local and immediate issues.\nSo how can society benefit from this positive (though skeptical) attitude and engage youngsters in civic participation? The way we understand the situation, young people should be better informed and prepared with the right tools to exercise their citizenship, which is what formal education programs on topics related to politics and citizenship aim to promote.\nIntegrating civic education into formal school curricula\nThe relationship between formal education and political participation is perhaps one of the best-established relationships that exists in the field of political behavior. It is generally argued that with more formal education comes a greater interest in politics, a greater concern with elections, a greater confidence in carrying out one\u2019s role as a citizen, and so on.\nFor these reasons, there has been a notable growth in the interest of new approaches to civic education around the world since the last decade of the twentieth century. This interest has taken many forms, including program implementations, research projects, policy plans, and the development of important resources and curriculum initiatives for schools to meet the need for a new and more effective educational approach to democratic citizenship. This entire movement was due to the reported decline in the rate of active participation of citizens in civic life. Consequently, many Western democracies carried out analyses and research projects that subsequently inspired curriculum initiatives that reflected a new approach to civic education and citizenship for schools.\nGenerally, these educational programs have been centered on three aspects: (1) political knowledge, (2) civic participation, and (3) strengthening democratic values. What is generally suggested is that the school should work on the themes of civic education through democratic practices governed by criteria of equality, freedom, and justice. The objective would, therefore, be to prepare young people to adopt democratic ideas and habits, teaching them how to participate in civic life, and how to make autonomous and informed decisions. This would encourage self-reflection and foster an understanding of both individual and collective interests, emphasizing the importance of maintaining consistent opinions on significant issues over time.

Challenger\nIn an era of rising authoritarianism, civic education and political literacy, especially for future voters, is key \u2026\nAmerican democracy just survived a near-death experience during the slow-motion coup that was the four years of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. It culminated in his rejecting his electoral loss and pressuring officials and political allies to back his claims that the election was fraudulent and, at the end, inciting his supporters to storm the Capitol in an effort to stay in power. During his time as president, he attacked the press, undermined truth with lies and conspiracy theories, and flouted countless institutional norms such as the peaceful transition of power and the rule of law that American democracy has depended on to function.\nHe never intended to be a leader of the entire nation, and instead fashioned a politics of us vs. them to gain and strengthen his hold on power. Scholars of authoritarianism during this period have argued that Trump was not like any past American president. Ruth Ben-Ghiat, author of Strongmen: From Mussolini to the Present, for example, claims that we cannot understand the past four years by using a democratic frame of reference. Rather, we should see how Trump fit the mold of fascist dictators. He came to power through a democratic election but used the authoritarian playbook to incite division and violence in the country while terrorizing government officials and bullying most in his own party into an unquestioning loyalty to him.\nHis rise to the presidency and his hold on the Republican party was made possible by his sizable base of supporters of ordinary Americans, almost half the country by some estimates. And even after he incited an insurrection by some of those supporters at the Capitol, many of his followers continue to support him and his actions. This should be a cause of great concern.\nThe rulers we deserve?\nIt has been wisely said that in a democracy, we get the rulers we deserve. This begs the question in the aftermath of Trump\u2019s presidency and near re-election: Why do so many Americans support him and his anti-democratic style of leadership?\nThere are several important causes to the rise of Trump and his base including persistent personal and institutional racism, Christian nationalism, deindustrialization, rising economic inequality, and the inability of governing elites (of either party) during the neoliberal decades since Reagan to adequately address these forces of our collective pain and disintegration. The abandonment of the working and middle classes over the past 40 years has generated a populist anger turned toward government in general. Still, I want to argue for yet another cause for Trumpism: the lack of effective civic education in our schools and universities.\nThis lack has left many people politically illiterate and open to supporting an authoritarian leader who gives expression to their misdirected rage and nostalgia. Trump would have gone nowhere without his angry, xenophobic, racist, misogynist and politically illiterate base. And he knew it when he famously said at one of his rallies, \u201cI love the poorly educated.\u201d\nNow more than ever, we Americans are aware of the fragility of our democratic norms and institutions. When Trump was putting enormous pressure on mostly Republican local and state election officials to interfere with the election processes and later tried to enlist the support of military leaders in his effort to stay in power, it was only by the strength of those officials\u2019 character and ethical actions that our democratic institutions were preserved. The local election officials and state lawmakers in Michigan, Georgia\u2019s Secretary of State Brad Raffensberger and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley are a few examples of people acting on their respect for truth and the rule of law that enabled our country to pull back from falling to a dictator.\nWhat would have happened if they had instead caved into the pressure from Trump and his followers? One lesson the past couple months should have taught us is that our vaunted democratic institutions remain vital only when people working within them exercise good judgment on behalf of their commitment to democratic values and norms and are able to do so because they feel the moral pressure of other citizens whose allegiance lies above party or a particular leader.\nPlato in Book VIII of The Republic long ago warned that the perennial weakness of democracies was their vulnerability to demagogues who come to power by capturing the darker forces within a citizenry and go on to turn the government into a state of tyranny. Donald Trump admires contemporary tyrants\u2014ranging from Duterte in the Philippines, Erdogan in Turkey, Bolsonaro in Brazil, to Putin in Russia and Orban in Hungary. Trump is the American version. He may not be our last.\nCalling for civics\nIn the era of rising authoritarianism, civic education and political literacy, especially for future voters, is key to protecting democracy. A renewed commitment to it would help us repair the divisions in our society and help restore a common bond and sense of purpose. Important initiatives engaged in this work are already afoot in New Hampshire and New England. The New Hampshire Institute for Civics Education, for example, is focused on updating state standards for civics education and organizes workshops aimed to help K-12 teachers integrate the teaching of civics into their already-packed curricula. The Tisch College of Civic Life at Tufts University\u2014a long-time leader in the study of civic engagement\u2014recently launched a first-in-the nation Civic Studies interdisciplinary major, in which students learn civic skills, study justice, social conflict, civic action and social movements while double-majoring in another arts and science discipline.\nOur founders, steeped as they were in the Enlightenment and the political thought of antiquity, knew educatio\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

It culminated in his rejecting his electoral loss and pressuring officials and political allies to back his claims that the election was fraudulent and, at the end, inciting his supporters to storm the Capitol in an effort to stay in power. During his time as president, he attacked the press, undermined truth with lies and conspiracy theories, and flouted countless institutional norms such as the peaceful transition of power and the rule of law that American democracy has depended on to function.\nHe never intended to be a leader of the entire nation, and instead fashioned a politics of us vs. them to gain and strengthen his hold on power. Scholars of authoritarianism during this period have argued that Trump was not like any past American president. Ruth Ben-Ghiat, author of Strongmen: From Mussolini to the Present, for example, claims that we cannot understand the past four years by using a democratic frame of reference. Rather, we should see how Trump fit the mold of fascist dictators. He came to power through a democratic election but used the authoritarian playbook to incite division and violence in the country while terrorizing government officials and bullying most in his own party into an unquestioning loyalty to him.\nHis rise to the presidency and his hold on the Republican party was made possible by his sizable base of supporters of ordinary Americans, almost half the country by some estimates. And even after he incited an insurrection by some of those supporters at the Capitol, many of his followers continue to support him and his actions. This should be a cause of great concern.\nThe rulers we deserve?\nIt has been wisely said that in a democracy, we get the rulers we deserve. This begs the question in the aftermath of Trump\u2019s presidency and near re-election: Why do so many Americans support him and his anti-democratic style of leadership?\nThere are several important causes to the rise of Trump and his base including persistent personal and institutional racism, Christian nationalism, deindustrialization, rising economic inequality, and the inability of governing elites (of either party) during the neoliberal decades since Reagan to adequately address these forces of our collective pain and disintegration. The abandonment of the working and middle classes over the past 40 years has generated a populist anger turned toward government in general. Still, I want to argue for yet another cause for Trumpism: the lack of effective civic education in our schools and universities.\nThis lack has left many people politically illiterate and open to supporting an authoritarian leader who gives expression to their misdirected rage and nostalgia. Trump would have gone nowhere without his angry, xenophobic, racist, misogynist and politically illiterate base.

The Revolution precipitated a series of European wars, forcing the United States to articulate a clear policy of neutrality in order to avoid being embroiled in these European conflicts. The French Revolution also influenced U.S. politics, as pro- and anti- Revolutionary factions sought to influence American domestic and foreign policy.\nWhen the first rumors of political change in France reached American shores in 1789, the U.S. public was largely enthusiastic. Americans hoped for democratic reforms that would solidify the existing Franco-American alliance and transform France into a republican ally against aristocratic and monarchical Britain. However, with revolutionary change also came political instability, violence, and calls for radical social change in France that frightened many Americans. American political debate over the nature of the French Revolution exacerbated pre-existing political divisions and resulted in the alignment of the political elite along pro-French and pro-British lines. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson became the leader of the pro-French Democratic-Republican Party that celebrated the republican ideals of the French Revolution. Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton led the Federalist Party, which viewed the Revolution with skepticism and sought to preserve existing commercial ties with Great Britain. With the two most powerful members of his cabinet locked in opposition, President George Washington tried to strike a balance between the two.\nFrom 1790 to 1794, the French Revolution became increasingly radical. After French King Louis XVI was tried and executed on January 21, 1793, war between France and monarchal nations Great Britain and Spain was inevitable. These two powers joined Austria and other European nations in the war against Revolutionary France that had already started in 1791. The United States remained neutral, as both Federalists and Democratic-Republicans saw that war would lead to economic disaster and the possibility of invasion. This policy was made difficult by heavy-handed British and French actions. The British harassed neutral American merchant ships, while the French Government dispatched a controversial Minister to the United States, Edmond-Charles Gen\u00eat, whose violations of the American neutrality policy embroiled the two countries in the Citizen Gen\u00eat Affair until his recall in 1794.\nIn 1794, the French Revolution entered its most violent phase, the Terror. Under foreign invasion, the French Government declared a state of emergency, and many foreigners residing in France were arrested, including American revolutionary pamphleteer Thomas Paine, owing to his British birth. Although U.S. Minister to France Gouverneur Morris was unable to obtain Paine\u2019s release, Morris was able to intercede successfully on behalf of many other Americans imprisoned during the Terror, including the American Consuls at Dunkirk, Rouen, and Le Havre. Once the Terror ended in late July of 1794, the arrests ended, and Paine, who had been scheduled to be executed, was released.\nAlthough the French Revolution had ended its radical phase, Federalists in the United States remained wary of revolutionary ideology infiltrating the United States. Many French citizens, refugees from the French and Haitian revolutions, had settled in American cities and remained politically active, setting up newspapers and agitating for their political causes. A French spy, Victor Collot, traveled through the United States in 1796, noting the weaknesses in its western border. When a breakdown in diplomatic negotiations resulted in the Quasi-War with France, the Federalist-controlled Congress passed a series of laws known as the Alien and Sedition Acts, intended to curb political dissent and limit the political participation of immigrants by easing deportation and lengthening the time required for citizenship. A number of political radicals were arrested for sedition, including Congressman Matthew Lyon and newspaper editors James Thompson Callendar and William Duane. Many refugees, sensing American hostility, chose to return to France and Haiti since the political situation had temporarily calmed in both places.\nThe Alien and Sedition Acts, originally intended to prevent a growth in pro-French sentiment, actually backfired for the Federalists. Taken aback by such extreme measures, swing voters in the presidential election of 1800 instead backed the pro-French Thomas Jefferson and his Democratic-Republican Party, instead of the Federalist John Adams, who was running for re-election as President. Adams had also alienated the anti-Revolutionary wing of his party by seeking peace with France, whose revolution had already been brought to a close by General Napoleon Bonaparte.\nDespite Federalist warnings that electing Jefferson would bring revolution to the United States, Jefferson instead chose to distance himself from political radicals and win over political moderates. The revolution in France was over, and while many Americans voters sympathized with the revolution in the abstract, they did not want the revolution\u2019s most radical changes put into effect in the United States.\nhistory@state.gov\nPhone: 202-955-0200\nReport an issue on this page\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

American political debate over the nature of the French Revolution exacerbated pre-existing political divisions and resulted in the alignment of the political elite along pro-French and pro-British lines. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson became the leader of the pro-French Democratic-Republican Party that celebrated the republican ideals of the French Revolution. Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton led the Federalist Party, which viewed the Revolution with skepticism and sought to preserve existing commercial ties with Great Britain. With the two most powerful members of his cabinet locked in opposition, President George Washington tried to strike a balance between the two.\nFrom 1790 to 1794, the French Revolution became increasingly radical. After French King Louis XVI was tried and executed on January 21, 1793, war between France and monarchal nations Great Britain and Spain was inevitable. These two powers joined Austria and other European nations in the war against Revolutionary France that had already started in 1791. The United States remained neutral, as both Federalists and Democratic-Republicans saw that war would lead to economic disaster and the possibility of invasion. This policy was made difficult by heavy-handed British and French actions. The British harassed neutral American merchant ships, while the French Government dispatched a controversial Minister to the United States, Edmond-Charles Gen\u00eat, whose violations of the American neutrality policy embroiled the two countries in the Citizen Gen\u00eat Affair until his recall in 1794.\nIn 1794, the French Revolution entered its most violent phase, the Terror. Under foreign invasion, the French Government declared a state of emergency, and many foreigners residing in France were arrested, including American revolutionary pamphleteer Thomas Paine, owing to his British birth. Although U.S. Minister to France Gouverneur Morris was unable to obtain Paine\u2019s release, Morris was able to intercede successfully on behalf of many other Americans imprisoned during the Terror, including the American Consuls at Dunkirk, Rouen, and Le Havre. Once the Terror ended in late July of 1794, the arrests ended, and Paine, who had been scheduled to be executed, was released.\nAlthough the French Revolution had ended its radical phase, Federalists in the United States remained wary of revolutionary ideology infiltrating the United States. Many French citizens, refugees from the French and Haitian revolutions, had settled in American cities and remained politically active, setting up newspapers and agitating for their political causes. A French spy, Victor Collot, traveled through the United States in 1796, noting the weaknesses in its western border. When a breakdown in diplomatic negotiations resulted in the Quasi-War with France, the Federalist-controlled Congress passed a series of laws known as the Alien and Sedition Acts, intended to curb political dissent and limit the political participation of immigrants by easing deportation and lengthening the time required for citizenship. A number of political radicals were arrested for sedition, including Congressman Matthew Lyon and newspaper editors James Thompson Callendar and William Duane. Many refugees, sensing American hostility, chose to return to France and Haiti since the political situation had temporarily calmed in both places.\nThe Alien and Sedition Acts, originally intended to prevent a growth in pro-French sentiment, actually backfired for the Federalists. Taken aback by such extreme measures, swing voters in the presidential election of 1800 instead backed the pro-French Thomas Jefferson and his Democratic-Republican Party, instead of the Federalist John Adams, who was running for re-election as President. Adams had also alienated the anti-Revolutionary wing of his party by seeking peace with France, whose revolution had already been brought to a close by General Napoleon Bonaparte.\nDespite Federalist warnings that electing Jefferson would bring revolution to the United States, Jefferson instead chose to distance himself from political radicals and win over political moderates. The revolution in France was over, and while many Americans voters sympathized with the revolution in the abstract, they did not want the revolution\u2019s most radical changes put into effect in the United States.\nhistory@state.gov\nPhone: 202-955-0200\nReport an issue on this page\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Let\u2019s go!\nNow that we are settled, let\u2019s do a quick review. Does anyone remember where in the world ancient Athens was located? What did the world look like, according to ancient Athenians? What made ancient Athens special? Why are we studying it today?\nSLIDE 8 So how did democracy work in ancient Athens? Ancient Athenians practiced the simplest form of democracy, what we today call direct democracy. Can anyone venture a guess as to what direct democracy means? If we take the literal meaning of the words together, it means \u201cdirect rule by the people.\u201d This means every citizen of ancient Athens could vote on the issues facing the government, and the majority ruled.[1]\nDoes anyone know what it means to vote? It means choosing between two or more options, and having your choice officially counted.[2] So in ancient Athens, the citizens would gather together to make a choice about the issues of the day. The option that most people chose would win. This is what is meant by majority rule. Every citizen directly participated in making government decisions.\nBut remember, we\u2019re talking about 2,500 years ago\u2013a time before tv, newspapers, radio, the internet, and cell phones. How did every citizen know about the issues? How did they learn what they needed to know about the issues in order to form their own opinions?

In ancient Athens, this space was called an agora. There was an agora in every ancient Greek city, a central place where people could gather to shop, meet, and share news. [2]\nSLIDE 13 Now it is time to make our inferences. Remember, we\u2019re looking at this picture to answer the question of how citizens learned the information they needed to vote in ancient Athens. Based on this image, what do you think? How might the agora be important to democracy in ancient Athens?\nSLIDE 14 The agora was a place where people gathered every day to share news and argue about the issues, the necessary work that comes before casting a vote. Citizens might speak to the crowds in the agora to gather support for their laws or projects. In this image, you can see a small crowd gathered around a speaker.\nSo, in Ancient Athens, people visited the agora every day to do their shopping, hear the news, and gossip with their neighbors. It was a great place for people to hear about the important matters facing the city-state and learn how their neighbors felt about them. This kind of space for information sharing and gathering is critical to a healthy democracy.\nPart 3: Practicing Direct Democracy (35 min)\nSLIDE 15 Now that we have the basics, the best way to understand how this all worked is to just give it a try.

Before we dive in with our new essential question, I want to take a moment to reflect back on what we\u2019ve learned so far. In the first unit, we explored the question \u201cwhat is democracy?\u201d\nEveryone in the room is going to get a Post-it note. I want you to write the single most important thing you feel you learned while we explored that question. Put another way: what is one thing you want to make sure your community knows about democracy?\nSLIDE 2 Now we are going to shift gears to unit two. We\u2019ve learned that democracy means a government where the people rule. But what does that actually look like? In the next two lessons, we are going to explore sources from ancient Athens and the early US to answer the question \u201cHow does democracy work?\u201d\nFor the duration of the institute, we recommend using this popular protest chant whenever you need to get the students\u2019 attention. This is in keeping with the spirit of The Academy and reinforces both the playful and civic elements of the program.\nTo help set the tone that this is going to be more like a history lab or camp than a typical classroom lesson, we recommend starting each day or lesson with a fun warm up activity to get students fired up. Below are instructions for introducing The New York Historical\u2019s preferred warm up game \u2013 Rock, Paper, Scissors Tournament \u2013 but you can choose whatever game or activity you think will work best with your students.\nPart 2: Direct Democracy (20 min)\nWe\u2019re going to start our exploration 2,500 years ago in ancient Athens, which means we must transform our space to get in the spirit. Let\u2019s go!\nNow that we are settled, let\u2019s do a quick review. Does anyone remember where in the world ancient Athens was located? What did the world look like, according to ancient Athenians? What made ancient Athens special? Why are we studying it today?\nSLIDE 8 So how did democracy work in ancient Athens? Ancient Athenians practiced the simplest form of democracy, what we today call direct democracy. Can anyone venture a guess as to what direct democracy means? If we take the literal meaning of the words together, it means \u201cdirect rule by the people.\u201d This means every citizen of ancient Athens could vote on the issues facing the government, and the majority ruled.[1]\nDoes anyone know what it means to vote? It means choosing between two or more options, and having your choice officially counted.[2] So in ancient Athens, the citizens would gather together to make a choice about the issues of the day. The option that most people chose would win. This is what is meant by majority rule. Every citizen directly participated in making government decisions.\nBut remember, we\u2019re talking about 2,500 years ago\u2013a time before tv, newspapers, radio, the internet, and cell phones. How did every citizen know about the issues? How did they learn what they needed to know about the issues in order to form their own opinions? Let\u2019s analyze a painting to find out.\nWho remembers the three steps of inquiry? Let\u2019s start with observation. What do you see in this image?\n[1] The Constitution Society. \u201cDirect Democracy,\u201d accessed July 31, 2024, https://consoc.org.uk/the-constitution-explained/direct-democracy/.\n[2] Merriam-Webster.com Dictionary, s.v. \u201cvote,\u201d accessed January 28, 2025, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vote.\nNow that we have a list of observations, can anyone use those observations to identify what this image is showing us?\nThis is an artist\u2019s rendering of what ancient Athens looked like at its peak. Fun fact: Pericles, who we heard from yesterday, played a central role in building all those buildings you see at the top of the image.[1] But for our purposes today, the most important part of this image is what is happening front and center. In ancient Athens, this space was called an agora. There was an agora in every ancient Greek city, a central place where people could gather to shop, meet, and share news.
