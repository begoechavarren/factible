    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nThis is the story of three plastic bottles, empty and discarded. Their journeys are about to diverge with outcomes that impact nothing less than the fate of the planet. But they weren't always this way. To understand where these bottles end up, we must first explore their origins. The heroes of our story were conceived in this oil refinery. The plastic in their bodies was formed by chemically bonding oil and gas molecules together to make monomers. In turn, these monomers were bonded into long polymer chains to make plastic in the form of millions of pellets. Those were melted at manufacturing plants and reformed in molds to create the resilient material that makes up the triplets' bodies. Machines filled the bottles with sweet bubbily liquid and they were then wrapped, shipped, bought, opened, consumed and unceremoniously discarded. And now here they lie, poised at the edge of the unknown. Bottle one, like hundreds of millions of tons of his plastic brethren, ends up in a landfill. This huge dump expands each day as more trash comes in and continues to take up space. As plastics sit there being compressed amongst layers of other junk, rainwater flows through the waste and absorbs the water-soluble compounds it contains, and some of those are highly toxic. Together, they create a harmful stew called leachate, which can move into groundwater, soil and streams, poisoning ecosystems and harming wildlife. It can take bottle one an agonizing 1,000 years to decompose. Bottle two's journey is stranger but, unfortunately, no happier. He floats on a trickle that reaches a stream, a stream that flows into a river, and a river that reaches the ocean. After months lost at sea, he's slowly drawn into a massive vortex, where trash accumulates, a place known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Here the ocean's currents have trapped millions of pieces of plastic debris. This is one of five plastic-filled gyres in the world's seas. Places where the pollutants turn the water into a cloudy plastic soup. Some animals, like seabirds, get entangled in the mess. They, and others, mistake the brightly colored plastic bits for food. Plastic makes them feel full when they're not, so they starve to death and pass the toxins from the plastic up the food chain. For example, it's eaten by lanternfish, the lanternfish are eaten by squid, the squid are eaten by tuna, and the tuna are eaten by us. And most plastics don't biodegrade, which means they're destined to break down into smaller and smaller pieces called micro plastics, which might rotate in the sea eternally. But bottle three is spared the cruel purgatories of his brothers. A truck brings him to a plant where he and his companions are squeezed flat and compressed into a block. Okay, this sounds pretty bad, too, but hang in there. It gets better. The blocks are shredded into tiny pieces, which are washed and melted, so they become the raw materials that can be used again. As if by magic, bottle three is now ready to be reborn as something completely new. For this bit of plastic with such humble origins, suddenly the sky is the limit.",

MPs have also been detected ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government. Here's how you know we're official.\nAnimals have been eating, or ingesting, plastic and other marine debris for a long time. The ingestion of plastic by wildlife was first observed in 1966, when researchers found plastic container lids and toys in dead Laysan albatross chicks. These observations happened more than 20 years before the Great Pacific Garbage Patch was discovered. A review by Kuhn and van Franeker(link is external) found that over 700 species, including seabirds, fish, turtles, and marine mammals, have been confirmed to eat plastic. That number will likely increase over time as wildlife continues to encounter our trash.\nDebris items may be mistaken for food and ingested, or may be accidentally ingested when mixed with or attached to an animal's natural food. Because many plastics float, break into small, easily eaten pieces, and are colorful, they are more likely to attract hungry animals than other types of marine debris. Eating plastic may lead to loss of nutrition, internal injury, intestinal blockage, starvation, and even death. We know that ingested plastic is harmful to animals, and research is still being conducted to figure out all the effects, especially to communities and wild populations.\nPlankton, shellfish, birds, fish, marine mammals, and sea turtles from all parts of the globe and from various depths of the ocean have been confirmed to ingest plastic debris. The amount and type of plastic they eat often relates directly to the animal\u2019s feeding behavior. Passive feeders, or animals that filter their food from water or soil, may unintentionally eat microplastics with their food. Animals that are active feeders, that search for and capture their food, ingest plastic not only accidentally while feeding, but also any debris inside of their prey.\nSome animals are able to release debris without passing it fully into the digestive system, such as birds that can regurgitate, or throw up indigestible materials. Debris can also pass completely through the digestive system for many animals depending on its shape and size. If an animal is not able to regurgitate or pass marine debris through their system, it can cause serious health problems. Sharp or rough plastic marine debris can create cuts in the digestive system, leading to infection and internal bleeding. It can also block their digestive system, making them feel full, reducing their urge to eat, and making it difficult for the animal to get the nutrients they need.\nPlastic can also carry harmful pollutants. They may absorb pollutants that are in the water around them, or release chemicals that are added to plastics during production to make them colorful or flexible. These chemicals may enter the body of an animal if ingested. Whether an animal eats the plastic itself, or eats an animal that has already eaten plastic, there could be possible health impacts on marine wildlife. Although wildlife may be exposed to these contaminants from plastics, more research is needed to understand how they might be affected, depending on the size of the plastics and how long they stay in an animal.\nSea Turtles: All seven species of sea turtles have been confirmed to eat marine debris. Sea turtles most commonly try to eat plastic sheeting and plastic bags, which may resemble their jellyfish prey. This type of debris can get stuck in their digestive system, making them feel full. Since they no longer feel hungry, they lose the urge to feed which can lead to poor nutrition and starvation. A review by K\u00fchn and van Franeker(link is external) estimated that 32% of turtles have plastic marine debris in their stomachs. Learn more about how ingesting marine debris affects turtles with the University of North Carolina Wilmington\u2019s MarineQuest Turtle Trash Collectors Interactive Video.\nBirds: The impacts of marine debris to birds are well studied. A review by K\u00fchn and van Franeker(link is external) found that over 40% of seabird species studied have ingested plastic. Albatrosses, fulmars, and shearwaters are among the seabird species that may be most affected by marine debris as it can get stuck entering their gizzard or in their gizzard, a section of the stomach that grinds food, and cannot easily pass through the digestive system. Laysan albatross chicks that ingested large amounts of plastic have been found to have lower weights, as the plastic in their stomach keeps them from eating a full meal. Adults not only build nests using collected debris, but pass any ingested debris on to their offspring when the chicks are fed.\nMarine Mammals: Many species of marine mammals have also been confirmed to eat marine debris. A review by K\u00fchn and van Franeker(link is external) found that 69 species of marine mammals have been found to ingest debris - that\u2019s 56% of all marine mammals! This includes 44 species of odontocetes (toothed whales), manatees, and multiple seal species. Marine mammals are highly protected, which can make it difficult to research them. Most research on marine mammals takes place after an animal dies, making it difficult to understand what marine debris live animals eat. However, we do know that because baleen whales filter extremely large amounts of water while feeding, they may get plastic debris entangled in their baleen plates.\nPlastics that are transported by surface currents will collect more debris in areas where currents meet, called convergence zones. In these areas, there are lots of nutrients, and the algae and phytoplankton at the base of the complex marine food web gather here. As areas with readily available food sources, they attract marine life across the food web, from tiny zooplankton to large marine mammals. Larger amounts of marine debris also collect in these areas where animals are most likely to look for food and feed, increasing the likelihood that they may accidentally eat plastics and marine debris.\nAlthough some animals may be more likely to eat plas\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Moreover, animals that ingest plastic will transfer the material up the food chain ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government. Here's how you know we're official.\nAnimals have been eating, or ingesting, plastic and other marine debris for a long time. The ingestion of plastic by wildlife was first observed in 1966, when researchers found plastic container lids and toys in dead Laysan albatross chicks. These observations happened more than 20 years before the Great Pacific Garbage Patch was discovered. A review by Kuhn and van Franeker(link is external) found that over 700 species, including seabirds, fish, turtles, and marine mammals, have been confirmed to eat plastic. That number will likely increase over time as wildlife continues to encounter our trash.\nDebris items may be mistaken for food and ingested, or may be accidentally ingested when mixed with or attached to an animal's natural food. Because many plastics float, break into small, easily eaten pieces, and are colorful, they are more likely to attract hungry animals than other types of marine debris. Eating plastic may lead to loss of nutrition, internal injury, intestinal blockage, starvation, and even death. We know that ingested plastic is harmful to animals, and research is still being conducted to figure out all the effects, especially to communities and wild populations.\nPlankton, shellfish, birds, fish, marine mammals, and sea turtles from all parts of the globe and from various depths of the ocean have been confirmed to ingest plastic debris. The amount and type of plastic they eat often relates directly to the animal\u2019s feeding behavior. Passive feeders, or animals that filter their food from water or soil, may unintentionally eat microplastics with their food. Animals that are active feeders, that search for and capture their food, ingest plastic not only accidentally while feeding, but also any debris inside of their prey.\nSome animals are able to release debris without passing it fully into the digestive system, such as birds that can regurgitate, or throw up indigestible materials. Debris can also pass completely through the digestive system for many animals depending on its shape and size. If an animal is not able to regurgitate or pass marine debris through their system, it can cause serious health problems. Sharp or rough plastic marine debris can create cuts in the digestive system, leading to infection and internal bleeding. It can also block their digestive system, making them feel full, reducing their urge to eat, and making it difficult for the animal to get the nutrients they need.\nPlastic can also carry harmful pollutants. They may absorb pollutants that are in the water around them, or release chemicals that are added to plastics during production to make them colorful or flexible. These chemicals may enter the body of an animal if ingested. Whether an animal eats the plastic itself, or eats an animal that has already eaten plastic, there could be possible health impacts on marine wildlife. Although wildlife may be exposed to these contaminants from plastics, more research is needed to understand how they might be affected, depending on the size of the plastics and how long they stay in an animal.\nSea Turtles: All seven species of sea turtles have been confirmed to eat marine debris. Sea turtles most commonly try to eat plastic sheeting and plastic bags, which may resemble their jellyfish prey. This type of debris can get stuck in their digestive system, making them feel full. Since they no longer feel hungry, they lose the urge to feed which can lead to poor nutrition and starvation. A review by K\u00fchn and van Franeker(link is external) estimated that 32% of turtles have plastic marine debris in their stomachs. Learn more about how ingesting marine debris affects turtles with the University of North Carolina Wilmington\u2019s MarineQuest Turtle Trash Collectors Interactive Video.\nBirds: The impacts of marine debris to birds are well studied. A review by K\u00fchn and van Franeker(link is external) found that over 40% of seabird species studied have ingested plastic. Albatrosses, fulmars, and shearwaters are among the seabird species that may be most affected by marine debris as it can get stuck entering their gizzard or in their gizzard, a section of the stomach that grinds food, and cannot easily pass through the digestive system. Laysan albatross chicks that ingested large amounts of plastic have been found to have lower weights, as the plastic in their stomach keeps them from eating a full meal. Adults not only build nests using collected debris, but pass any ingested debris on to their offspring when the chicks are fed.\nMarine Mammals: Many species of marine mammals have also been confirmed to eat marine debris. A review by K\u00fchn and van Franeker(link is external) found that 69 species of marine mammals have been found to ingest debris - that\u2019s 56% of all marine mammals! This includes 44 species of odontocetes (toothed whales), manatees, and multiple seal species. Marine mammals are highly protected, which can make it difficult to research them. Most research on marine mammals takes place after an animal dies, making it difficult to understand what marine debris live animals eat. However, we do know that because baleen whales filter extremely large amounts of water while feeding, they may get plastic debris entangled in their baleen plates.\nPlastics that are transported by surface currents will collect more debris in areas where currents meet, called convergence zones. In these areas, there are lots of nutrients, and the algae and phytoplankton at the base of the complex marine food web gather here. As areas with readily available food sources, they attract marine life across the food web, from tiny zooplankton to large marine mammals. Larger amounts of marine debris also collect in these areas where animals are most likely to look for food and feed, increasing the likelihood that they may accidentally eat plastics and marine debris.\nAlthough some animals may be more likely to eat plas\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Whether I save it for my family, donate it, or put it in the bin, my precious plastic toy will never go away \u2013 and that\u2019s not a good thing.\nRegardless of how we dispose of it, plastic will not biodegrade. So, what does that mean? Most plastics can and will break down into smaller pieces. Even without human intervention, wind currents, sunlight, and other natural processes will slowly wear plastic down. This process can take hundreds or even thousands of years. But that doesn\u2019t mean plastic reverts to nature \u2013 as a banana peel or a wooden toy does.\nMy stacking cups will eventually break into tiny plastic particles called microplastics. As plastic breaks down, it releases toxic chemicals and carcinogens into the environment. That\u2019s terrifying.\nToday, trillions of these tiny polluting particles \u2013 weighing over 2 million tons \u2013 float on the surface of the world\u2019s oceans. But it doesn\u2019t end there. Scientists have discovered that microplastics can break down even further. Due to their size, these nanoplastics can easily infiltrate our bodies through our skin, food, and even the air we breathe. The worst part? These plastic particles are not biodegradable either.\nPlastic that lasts forever spells terrible news for people and the environment. In the U.S. alone, we produce about 40 million metric tons of plastic annually. And 85% of this plastic will end up as waste in a landfill.\nSo, while I worry about the impact of my plastic toy, what truly concerns me is single-use plastics. After all, I\u2019ve only ever owned one set of stacking cups. Yet, most of us go through hundreds of single-use plastic items in our lifetime. The average person in the U.S. goes through about 156 plastic bottles and 365 disposable bags every year.\nSingle-use plastic packaging makes up about 40% of all plastic produced. This includes bottles, bags, and containers that, at best, will get used for a few hours before becoming trash.\nWhen plastic gets thrown into a landfill, it goes out of sight, but the pollutants it releases persist. In theory, landfills encase waste in enclosed cells. But that\u2019s far from the truth. Eventually, all landfills leak and leach toxic chemicals into our soil, air, and waterways. Because plastic is not biodegradable, it exacerbates this problem.\nIncineration does not provide a better outcome. When burned, plastic spews pollutants into the air \u2013 causing irreparable harm to the health of our communities. And the remaining ash from incineration ends up in a landfill, too.\nOur reliance on single-use plastic is poisoning us.\nBig Beverage companies like Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and Nestl\u00e9 have driven the global plastic pollution crisis for decades, thanks to the single-use bottles they use to sell their drinks. They have done everything they can to maintain the status quo.\nAmong its strategies to avoid responsibility, Big Beverage has invested millions of dollars to champion inadequate solutions like curbside recycling programs. Despite people\u2019s best efforts, these programs have failed. In the U.S., barely 6 % of plastic waste gets recycled annually.\nWhile pushing for curbside recycling feels noble, this tactic aims to put the burden and cost of plastic pollution on consumers instead of tackling the problem at its root. Big Beverage needs to stop trashing our communities. Yet, that doesn\u2019t make recycling obsolete. We have solutions like bottle return programs that help us recycle plastic and other materials effectively.\nHere\u2019s the rub: While recycling can keep some litter out of landfills and incinerators, not everything can be recycled. Plus, the process of recycling bottles and other containers also creates microplastics. These particles expose workers to toxic chemicals and infiltrate our environment through wastewater used to sanitize plastics.\nRecycling alone can\u2019t save us from plastic pollution \u2013 we must invest in zero-waste solutions.\nPlastic is not biodegradable, but that\u2019s no reason to throw up our hands in defeat. We still have time to switch to more sustainable options, such as refillable containers and reusable packaging. Let\u2019s reserve plastic for essential purposes \u2013 like medical equipment \u2013 and work to ditch single-use plastics for good.\nCLF and our partners have pushed elected officials to pass laws to help us make this critical transition. From banning plastic bags in retail to passing bottle deposit bills, these solutions can help us move toward a cleaner future.\nAfter all, if my children don\u2019t care to inherit my cherished plastic stacking cups, I doubt future generations will care to inherit our plastic waste.\nSo, let\u2019s take action to create the legacy our children and grandchildren deserve to inherit: a clean ocean, communities free from toxic pollution, and a healthy environment where they can achieve their full potential.\nStrong zero-waste laws can help us turn this goal into a reality worth leaving to future generations.

The two main ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nPlastic waste is a growing global problem. The negative impact of plastic debris, particularly on marine ecosystems, has been appreciated for decades. But potentially, an even more significant danger is the insidious microplastic we cannot see. Plastic waste does not biodegrade, rather, it breaks down, fragmented by wind, waves, and sunlight into ever-smaller pieces.\nMicroplastics, defined as plastic fragments less than 5 mm in size, are everywhere: in aquatic ecosystems, indoor and outdoor air, bottled drinking water and food. A recent report documenting the universal presence of microplastics in stool samples from people in eight countries confirms that microplastics are also in us.\nThese findings raise significant concerns and questions about whether and how microplastics impact human health. But, as confirmed by three high-profile scientific reviews published earlier in 2019, we know remarkably little about their human effects.\nA report by the Science Advice for Policy by European Academies consortium concluded that \u201cwe have no evidence of widespread risk to human health from micro and nanoplastics at present\u201d but noted that \u201clittle is known\u2026 and what is known is surrounded by considerable uncertainty.\u201d\nA second report by the European Commission\u2019s Group of Chief Scientific Advisors came to a similar conclusion: \u201cResearch on microplastics and their potential threats to humans is in its infancy and is complex \u2013 a lot remains uncertain.\u201d The third, by the World Health Organization (WHO), which focused on the human health hazard of microplastics in drinking water, concluded that \u201c\u2026.there is no evidence to indicate a human health concern\u201d, but described the evidence as \u201climited\u201d and \u201cinsufficient.\u201d\nAt this time we do not know whether microplastics constitute a human health concern. However, emerging data suggests we should not assume that microplastics are safe.\nPlastics are synthetic carbon-based chains (polymers) composed of smaller repeating units (monomers), which often contain additives that influence durability and rigidity. One of the major challenges in characterising the toxicity of microplastics is that their physical and chemical characteristics are extremely diverse. In terms of size, microplastics span at least seven orders of magnitude, from 5 mm down to a nanometre. Their shape varies from perfect spheres to jagged shards and fibres.\nChemically, microplastics consist of hundreds or even thousands of different polymers, and varying types and amounts of plasticisers or flame retardants. Microplastics adsorb chemical contaminants from the environment, such as pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and even metals, and each particle is surrounded by a \u201cbiofilm\u201d of microorganisms. Like snowflakes, every microparticle is unique.\nThere are multiple sources of microplastics. Primary microplastics are purposefully manufactured as industrial abrasives or microbeads used in cosmetics. Secondary microplastics result from the physical breakdown of plastic items through mechanical stress. Leading sources of environmental microplastics include clothing made from synthetic textiles, automotive tyre wear, city dust, road markings, coatings on ships and personal care products. Everyday activities also generate microplastics: a single load of laundry can release millions of microplastic fibres into wastewater. By some estimates, the average household generates 6 kilograms of plastic dust containing 700 billion plastic fragments every year.\nThe two main routes of human exposure to microplastics are ingestion and inhalation. But how much is taken up from the gut or lungs into the rest of the body remains unknown. Animal studies demonstrate that ingested microplastics are distributed to other organ systems. But the relevance of these findings to humans is questioned because the concentration of microplastics administered to animals was much higher than is found in the human diet.\nTheoretically, microplastics pose physical, chemical, and microbiological hazards.\nThe physical hazards of large plastic debris are well documented in aquatic species, including marine mammals, sea turtles, and marine birds. These effects include entrapment of animals in plastic debris, malnourishment due to ingestion of plastics in lieu of food, and obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract when plastic is mistakenly consumed. Microplastics can have similar physical effects on smaller organisms at the base of many food webs. Negative effects on \u201cprimary producers\u201d in aquatic ecosystems, such as algae and zooplankton, could lead to larger ecosystem disturbance. That microparticles pose a physical hazard to humans seems possible based on what we know about nanoparticles. For example, it is well documented that inhaled submicron particles cause physical irritation and inflammation in the lung.\nChemical hazards are the toxic effects of chemicals released from microparticles. Polymerisation reactions during production do not generally proceed to completion, thus, plastics often contain small proportions of monomers, such as 1,3-butadiene, ethylene oxide, and vinyl chloride, that can leach out of plastic. These chemicals are known to cause neurotoxicity, lung and liver damage and cancer. Many additives, which typically are not covalently bound to the polymer and thus readily leach out, have well-established toxicities. Toxic pollutants adsorbed to microparticles can also be released. The key question is whether any of these chemicals would reach concentrations in human tissues high enough to cause chronic toxicity following ingestion or inhalation of microparticles.\nMicroplastics can also serve as vectors for harmful microorganisms that readily colonise their surface. In this way, microplastics may concentrate or transport disease-associated bacteria and viruses, as well as filamentous cyanobacteria that cause harmful algal blooms. Microplastics may also facilitate the spread of antibiotic resistance genes.\nWhether an\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

These microplastics although chemically inert have ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government. Here's how you know we're official.\nAnimals have been eating, or ingesting, plastic and other marine debris for a long time. The ingestion of plastic by wildlife was first observed in 1966, when researchers found plastic container lids and toys in dead Laysan albatross chicks. These observations happened more than 20 years before the Great Pacific Garbage Patch was discovered. A review by Kuhn and van Franeker(link is external) found that over 700 species, including seabirds, fish, turtles, and marine mammals, have been confirmed to eat plastic. That number will likely increase over time as wildlife continues to encounter our trash.\nDebris items may be mistaken for food and ingested, or may be accidentally ingested when mixed with or attached to an animal's natural food. Because many plastics float, break into small, easily eaten pieces, and are colorful, they are more likely to attract hungry animals than other types of marine debris. Eating plastic may lead to loss of nutrition, internal injury, intestinal blockage, starvation, and even death. We know that ingested plastic is harmful to animals, and research is still being conducted to figure out all the effects, especially to communities and wild populations.\nPlankton, shellfish, birds, fish, marine mammals, and sea turtles from all parts of the globe and from various depths of the ocean have been confirmed to ingest plastic debris. The amount and type of plastic they eat often relates directly to the animal\u2019s feeding behavior. Passive feeders, or animals that filter their food from water or soil, may unintentionally eat microplastics with their food. Animals that are active feeders, that search for and capture their food, ingest plastic not only accidentally while feeding, but also any debris inside of their prey.\nSome animals are able to release debris without passing it fully into the digestive system, such as birds that can regurgitate, or throw up indigestible materials. Debris can also pass completely through the digestive system for many animals depending on its shape and size. If an animal is not able to regurgitate or pass marine debris through their system, it can cause serious health problems. Sharp or rough plastic marine debris can create cuts in the digestive system, leading to infection and internal bleeding. It can also block their digestive system, making them feel full, reducing their urge to eat, and making it difficult for the animal to get the nutrients they need.\nPlastic can also carry harmful pollutants. They may absorb pollutants that are in the water around them, or release chemicals that are added to plastics during production to make them colorful or flexible. These chemicals may enter the body of an animal if ingested. Whether an animal eats the plastic itself, or eats an animal that has already eaten plastic, there could be possible health impacts on marine wildlife. Although wildlife may be exposed to these contaminants from plastics, more research is needed to understand how they might be affected, depending on the size of the plastics and how long they stay in an animal.\nSea Turtles: All seven species of sea turtles have been confirmed to eat marine debris. Sea turtles most commonly try to eat plastic sheeting and plastic bags, which may resemble their jellyfish prey. This type of debris can get stuck in their digestive system, making them feel full. Since they no longer feel hungry, they lose the urge to feed which can lead to poor nutrition and starvation. A review by K\u00fchn and van Franeker(link is external) estimated that 32% of turtles have plastic marine debris in their stomachs. Learn more about how ingesting marine debris affects turtles with the University of North Carolina Wilmington\u2019s MarineQuest Turtle Trash Collectors Interactive Video.\nBirds: The impacts of marine debris to birds are well studied. A review by K\u00fchn and van Franeker(link is external) found that over 40% of seabird species studied have ingested plastic. Albatrosses, fulmars, and shearwaters are among the seabird species that may be most affected by marine debris as it can get stuck entering their gizzard or in their gizzard, a section of the stomach that grinds food, and cannot easily pass through the digestive system. Laysan albatross chicks that ingested large amounts of plastic have been found to have lower weights, as the plastic in their stomach keeps them from eating a full meal. Adults not only build nests using collected debris, but pass any ingested debris on to their offspring when the chicks are fed.\nMarine Mammals: Many species of marine mammals have also been confirmed to eat marine debris. A review by K\u00fchn and van Franeker(link is external) found that 69 species of marine mammals have been found to ingest debris - that\u2019s 56% of all marine mammals! This includes 44 species of odontocetes (toothed whales), manatees, and multiple seal species. Marine mammals are highly protected, which can make it difficult to research them. Most research on marine mammals takes place after an animal dies, making it difficult to understand what marine debris live animals eat. However, we do know that because baleen whales filter extremely large amounts of water while feeding, they may get plastic debris entangled in their baleen plates.\nPlastics that are transported by surface currents will collect more debris in areas where currents meet, called convergence zones. In these areas, there are lots of nutrients, and the algae and phytoplankton at the base of the complex marine food web gather here. As areas with readily available food sources, they attract marine life across the food web, from tiny zooplankton to large marine mammals. Larger amounts of marine debris also collect in these areas where animals are most likely to look for food and feed, increasing the likelihood that they may accidentally eat plastics and marine debris.\nAlthough some animals may be more likely to eat plas\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Meanwhile, certain deep-sea regions are littered with billions of plastic microfibers per square kilometer. Scientists call these statistics the \"wow factor\" of ocean trash. The tallies, published last year in three separate scientific papers, are useful in red-flagging the scope of the problem for the public. But beyond the shock value, just how does adding up those rice-size fragments of plastic help solve the problem? Although scientists have known for decades about the accumulating mass of ocean debris and its deadly consequences for seabirds, fish, and marine animals, the science of sea trash is young and full of as-yet-unsolved mysteries. Almost nothing was known about the amount of plastic in remote regions of the Southern Hemisphere, for example, until last year because few had ever traveled there to collect samples. \"The first piece is to understand where it is,\" says Kara Lavender Law, an oceanographer at the Sea Education Association in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. Indeed, until scientists learn more about where ocean trash is, how densely plastic accumulates in different ocean ecosystems, and how it degrades, they can't really calculate the damage it's causing. There are still big, basic questions: As it degrades, do plastic toxins seep into the marine environment? If so, how and in what amounts? And though scientists know a great deal about the damage to marine life caused by large pieces of plastic, the potential harm caused by microplastics is less clear. What effect do they have on fish that consume them? \"The greater the concentration, the greater the potential risk for exposure,\" says Richard Thompson, a biologist at Plymouth University in England, whose study released last month identified microfibers widely disseminated throughout the deep ocean. \"If we are missing a major sink where there are major concentrations of plastic, we might not be learning how harmful plastics are.\" The most recent counts add significantly to the knowledge base, yet even those big numbers are a fraction of the plastic that flows into the oceans every year. Where's the rest of it? It's another mystery. \"We are dealing with pieces from hundreds of meters down to microns in size,\" Thompson says. \"It is incredibly challenging to monitor.\" By The Numbers Ocean trash is counted in three ways: through beach surveys, computer models based on samples collected at sea, and estimates of the amount of trash entering the oceans. The most recent counts involved computer modeling based on samples taken at sea. The models may not account for all of the trash, scientists say; nonetheless, the new numbers are helping address some of the questions. The process of collecting and counting is meticulous, time-consuming work. It took Marcus Eriksen, co-founder of the 5 Gyres Institute, a nonprofit ocean advocacy group, more than four years, using samples gathered from 24 survey trips, to come up with his estimate that 5.25 trillion pieces of debris float on the surface. In the course of his expeditions, Eriksen collected everything from plastic candy wrappers to giant balls of fish netting. One massive ball of netting, found midway across the Pacific, contained 89 different kinds of net and line, all wrapped around a tiny, 2-inch-high teddy bear wearing a sorcerer's cap at the center. He says his research has helped fill in the outlines of the life cycle of ocean plastic. It tends to collect in the world's five large gyres, which are large systems of spiraling currents. Then, as the plastic degrades into fragments, it falls into deeper water, where currents carry it to remote parts of the globe. \"These fragments are anywhere on the planet at this point,\" he says. \"We're finding them everywhere.\" Eriksen's findings agree with those of a Spanish scientist, Andres Cozar Caba\u00f1as, a researcher at the University of Cadiz, in Spain, who published the first global map of floating ocean debris last July. Their estimates are strikingly similar. \"We now have two estimates of what is floating, and they are almost identical,\" says Lavender Law. \"They used different data sets and different methodology and came up with the same number. That gives us confidence we're in the right ballpark.\" Another way of coming up with the numbers is to make crude guesses based on manufacturing statistics. Says Jenna Jambeck, a University of Georgia environmental engineer who is completing a worldwide calculation of garbage collected in coastal countries: \"If you have 200 million tons produced every year, researchers will arbitrarily estimate that 10 percent goes into the oceans.\" Sort Out The Rubbish It's not too difficult to surmise why so much plastic ends up in the ocean. The Plastic Disclosure Project, a project run by Hong Kong-based advocacy group Ocean Recovery Alliance, estimates that 33 percent of plastic manufactured worldwide is used once, then discarded. To compound matters, 85 percent of the world's plastic is not recycled. Despite the magnitude of the numbers, Peter Ryan, a zoologist at the University of Cape Town, South Africa, who is writing a book tracing the evolution of marine debris research, says the problem can be solved. \"Marine debris, unlike global warming, should be an easy thing to deal with,\" he says. \"We have to sort out what to do with our rubbish.\" Ryan began tracking debris 30 years ago, after a colleague suggested he should s\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

One massive ball of netting, found midway across the Pacific, contained 89 different kinds of net and line, all wrapped around a tiny, 2-inch-high teddy bear wearing a sorcerer's cap at the center. He says his research has helped fill in the outlines of the life cycle of ocean plastic. It tends to collect in the world's five large gyres, which are large systems of spiraling currents. Then, as the plastic degrades into fragments, it falls into deeper water, where currents carry it to remote parts of the globe. \"These fragments are anywhere on the planet at this point,\" he says. \"We're finding them everywhere.\" Eriksen's findings agree with those of a Spanish scientist, Andres Cozar Caba\u00f1as, a researcher at the University of Cadiz, in Spain, who published the first global map of floating ocean debris last July. Their estimates are strikingly similar. \"We now have two estimates of what is floating, and they are almost identical,\" says Lavender Law. \"They used different data sets and different methodology and came up with the same number. That gives us confidence we're in the right ballpark.\" Another way of coming up with the numbers is to make crude guesses based on manufacturing statistics. Says Jenna Jambeck, a University of Georgia environmental engineer who is completing a worldwide calculation of garbage collected in coastal countries: \"If you have 200 million tons produced every year, researchers will arbitrarily estimate that 10 percent goes into the oceans.\" Sort Out The Rubbish It's not too difficult to surmise why so much plastic ends up in the ocean. The Plastic Disclosure Project, a project run by Hong Kong-based advocacy group Ocean Recovery Alliance, estimates that 33 percent of plastic manufactured worldwide is used once, then discarded. To compound matters, 85 percent of the world's plastic is not recycled. Despite the magnitude of the numbers, Peter Ryan, a zoologist at the University of Cape Town, South Africa, who is writing a book tracing the evolution of marine debris research, says the problem can be solved. \"Marine debris, unlike global warming, should be an easy thing to deal with,\" he says. \"We have to sort out what to do with our rubbish.\" Ryan began tracking debris 30 years ago, after a colleague suggested he should s\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Plastics are produced from natural gas, feedstocks derived from natural gas processing, and feedstocks derived from crude oil refining. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) is unable to determine the specific amounts or origin of the feedstocks that are actually used to manufacture plastics in the United States.\nPetrochemical feedstock naphtha and other oils refined from crude oil are used as feedstocks for petrochemical crackers that produce the basic building blocks for making plastics. EIA data can only identify those oil-derived feedstocks specifically designated as petrochemical feedstock by petroleum refineries in EIA\u2019s refining surveys, which break out into Naphtha For Petrochemical Feedstock Use and Other Oils For Petrochemical Feedstock Use. However, the petrochemical industry also consumes large quantities of hydrocarbon gas liquids (HGLs).\nThe majority of HGLs produced in the United States are byproducts of natural gas processing, and the rest are produced at crude oil/petroleum refineries. The HGLs produced by U.S. petroleum refineries contain both alkanes and olefins. Alkanes can be used as feedstock for petrochemical crackers, whereas refinery olefins, primarily propylene, but also minor quantities of ethylene and butylenes, can be used as direct inputs into plastics manufacturing. Because the petrochemical industry has a high degree of flexibility in the feedstock it consumes and because EIA does not collect detailed data on this aspect of industrial consumption, it is not possible for EIA to identify the actual amounts and origin of the materials used as inputs by industry to manufacture plastics.\nLearn more: Energy Explained: Hydrocarbon Gas Liquids Energy Explained: Refining Crude Oil\u2014Inputs and Outputs\nLast reviewed: July 10, 2024.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Meanwhile, certain deep-sea regions are littered with billions of plastic microfibers per square kilometer. Scientists call these statistics the \"wow factor\" of ocean trash. The tallies, published last year in three separate scientific papers, are useful in red-flagging the scope of the problem for the public. But beyond the shock value, just how does adding up those rice-size fragments of plastic help solve the problem? Although scientists have known for decades about the accumulating mass of ocean debris and its deadly consequences for seabirds, fish, and marine animals, the science of sea trash is young and full of as-yet-unsolved mysteries. Almost nothing was known about the amount of plastic in remote regions of the Southern Hemisphere, for example, until last year because few had ever traveled there to collect samples. \"The first piece is to understand where it is,\" says Kara Lavender Law, an oceanographer at the Sea Education Association in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. Indeed, until scientists learn more about where ocean trash is, how densely plastic accumulates in different ocean ecosystems, and how it degrades, they can't really calculate the damage it's causing. There are still big, basic questions: As it degrades, do plastic toxins seep into the marine environment? If so, how and in what amounts? And though scientists know a great deal about the damage to marine life caused by large pieces of plastic, the potential harm caused by microplastics is less clear. What effect do they have on fish that consume them? \"The greater the concentration, the greater the potential risk for exposure,\" says Richard Thompson, a biologist at Plymouth University in England, whose study released last month identified microfibers widely disseminated throughout the deep ocean. \"If we are missing a major sink where there are major concentrations of plastic, we might not be learning how harmful plastics are.\" The most recent counts add significantly to the knowledge base, yet even those big numbers are a fraction of the plastic that flows into the oceans every year. Where's the rest of it? It's another mystery. \"We are dealing with pieces from hundreds of meters down to microns in size,\" Thompson says. \"It is incredibly challenging to monitor.\" By The Numbers Ocean trash is counted in three ways: through beach surveys, computer models based on samples collected at sea, and estimates of the amount of trash entering the oceans. The most recent counts involved computer modeling based on samples taken at sea. The models may not account for all of the trash, scientists say; nonetheless, the new numbers are helping address some of the questions. The process of collecting and counting is meticulous, time-consuming work. It took Marcus Eriksen, co-founder of the 5 Gyres Institute, a nonprofit ocean advocacy group, more than four years, using samples gathered from 24 survey trips, to come up with his estimate that 5.25 trillion pieces of debris float on the surface.

Algalita Marine Research and Education Captain Charles ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nIn 1997 Captain Charles Moore was sailing from Hawaii to California when he noticed a steady stream of plastics bobbing in the ocean. He had discovered the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.\nOver a thousand miles from land in the central North Pacific Ocean, the boat captain and oceanographer Captain Charles Moore puzzled over the source of the litter.\n\"It can't be a trail of breadcrumbs like Hansel and Gretel leading me home,\" he recalled thinking. \"This has got to be a larger phenomenon.\"\nAfter two years of research and modelling, he returned to investigate. \"That's when we had the aha moment,\" he says. Using a net system to sample the surface of the ocean, he found six times as much plastic as plankton floating in the ocean.\nMoore had discovered the largest of five garbage patches around the world. Created by swirling ocean currents known as gyres, these act like a trash vortex, sucking in plastics and shifting constantly.\nSince its discovery, the Great Pacific Garbage Patch (GPGP) has often been depicted in the media as a floating mass of plastic, and referred to as a trash island. However, contrary to popular belief, there is no surface on which to stand and it can't be seen from space.\n\"It wasn't a mountain of trash, or a field of trash, it wasn't even a patch of trash,\" says Moore. Instead, the ocean looked like a murky soup, made up of different sized plastics.\nThis makes visualising the patch difficult. \"There is no such thing as a photo of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch,\" says Moore. Satellites, drones and Google Earth struggle to capture an overview of the highly mobile garbage patch, he says.\nIn the following 25 years, our understanding of garbage patches has deepened, with some attempting to quantify and clean them up. But many misconceptions still exist about these remote garbage patches, where few people can venture themselves.\nSign up to Future Earth\nSign up to the Future Earth newsletter to get essential climate news and hopeful developments in your inbox every Tuesday from Carl Nasman. This email is currently available to non-UK readers. In the UK? Sign up for newsletters here.\nThe scale of the GPGP is so great, it is often imagined as a landmass. A 2018 study predicted at least 79,000 tonnes of ocean plastic are floating inside an area of 1.6 million sq km (618,000 sq miles) \u2013 a figure that is four to 16 times higher than previously reported. This is twice the size of Texas, or three times the size of France.\nIn 2017, an advertising stunt for World Oceans Day contributed to this perception, by calling on the United Nations to rename the GPGP Trash Isles. The campaign rallied to make the area the world's 196th country, fit with its own flag, passports and currency.\nAlthough this raised the profile of the world's plastic problem, it played into myths surrounding the GPGP. A Google Image search still incorrectly reveals pictures of the GPGP as a solid mass of plastics, in some cases appearing almost sturdy enough to walk across.\nIn reality, ships can sail in and out, and mariners may not even release they are passing through a garbage patch. Studies indicate that \u2013 while more than 75% of the total mass of the garbage found in the GPGP is of debris greater than 5cm (1.9 in) in size \u2013 microplastics account for 94% of the estimated 1.8 trillion pieces floating in the area.\nCommon misconceptions can dampen the urgency to treat garbage patches. \"The problem is that most people are not aware of the issue, therefore they don't feel motivated enough to be engaged in solutions,\" says Walter Leal, a professor of Environment and Technology at Manchester Metropolitan University in the UK.\nLeft unchecked, more trash will accumulate in garbage patches. \"Indeed, they are growing bigger as we speak,\" says Leal. One 2021 paper predicts that the growth rate is 2.5% based on current trends \u2013 but the authors of the report warn that is a conservative estimate.\nOcean plastic can generate a host of environmental hazards, from the entanglement of creatures such as turtles, to consumption by birds and fish as it is mistaken for food.\nThe problem is so widespread it has given rise to the \"plastisphere\" \u2013 a term used for ecosystems that have evolved to live in human-made plastic environments.\nIn a recent study, researchers identified 484 invertebrates from around 100 pieces of plastic fished from the GPGP. Ocean currents had transported some species away from their natural habitat to live on plastics in the patch, risking strange mutations or biohazards.\nGarbage patches accumulate in the high seas \u2013 the parts of the ocean that are beyond territorial waters \u2013 so few governments will take responsibility for them. However, the problem is becoming harder to ignore, says Leal.\nCarbon Count\nThe emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.\nOn a recent trip to the South Pacific Leal recalls seeing plastic wash up on the shores of island nations such as Fiji, The Cook Islands and Vanuatu. \"These countries produce no plastic, but some plastics from the gyres find the way to the coast. That will also have an impact on tourism,\" he adds.\nIn the absence of government action, others have made it their mission to clear up garbage patches. One of the most famous attempts is by The Ocean Cleanup, a non-profit organisation founded by Dutch entrepreneur Boyan Slat.\nAt the age of 16, a high-school research paper on the GPGP coincided with a personal awakening about marine litter. \"I went scuba diving in Greece and I saw more plastic bags than fish,\" says Slat.\nHe scribbled a drawing on a paper napkin, which became the foundation of his tech-powered plan to clear the GPGP. Since then, The Ocean Cleanup has raked in millions of dollars of investment from donors such as the band Coldplay and The Coca-Cola Company.\n\"The solution is 50% hardware and 50% software,\" Sla\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The researchers have concluded that coastal species persist now in the open ocean as a substantial component of a neopelagic (floating deep-ocean) community sustained by the vast and expanding sea of plastic debris.\nAbstract: \u201cWe show that the high seas are colonized by a diverse array of coastal species, which survive and reproduce in the open ocean, contributing strongly to its floating community composition. Analysis of rafting plastic debris in the eastern North Pacific Subtropical Gyre revealed 37 coastal invertebrate taxa, largely of Western Pacific origin, exceeding pelagic taxa richness by threefold. Coastal taxa, including diverse taxonomic groups and life history traits, occurred on 70.5% of debris items. Most coastal taxa possessed either direct development or asexual reproduction, possibly facilitating long-term persistence on rafts. Our results suggest that the historical lack of available substrate limited the colonization of the open ocean by coastal species, rather than physiological or ecological constraints as previously assumed. It appears that coastal species persist now in the open ocean as a substantial component of a neopelagic community sustained by the vast and expanding sea of plastic debris.\u201d\nDespite increasing awareness of microplastic contamination, scientific research specifically addressing landfills as active origins of microplastics remains scarce.\nMicroplastics are everywhere\u2014and that's raising urgent health questions, scientists say.\nNew research unveils the toxic supply chain driving global plastic production, shining new light on the critical players driving...\nThe Problem with Plastic by Judith Enck and Adam Mahoney critically examines the paradox of plastic, first celebrated for...\n\u00a9 2025 Plastic Pollution Coalition.

The concentrations of several potentially toxic metals found in the surface and ground water in the vicinity of the landfill sites were above the maximum permissible limit values of department of Environment, Bangladesh and World Health Organization (WHO).

The total carcinogenic risk for Ni and Pb are found very high in the edible plants near those landfill sites, suggesting the risk of Ni and Pb induced carcinogenesis by the consumption of those plants. The present conditions of surface, ground water and agriculture products near the landfill sites of Bangladesh are much frightening to the biota and local inhabitants.\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13201-021-01431-3.\nKeywords: Landfill, Leachate pollution index, Water contamination, Health risk assessment, Bangladesh\nAnnual waste generation is increasing exponentially with rapid population growth, urbanization and industrial development in Bangladesh (Alam and Qiao 2020). The dumping of non-segregated solid waste to landfill sites is the most prevalent waste disposal practice in developing countries such as Bangladesh (Jahan et al. 2016; Kamal et al. 2016; Hossain et al. 2018; Xaypanya et al. 2018; Alam et al. 2020) and even in the part of developed countries (Mishra et al. 2019). The improper management of landfills and generation of toxic leachate thereby exert significant impacts on surrounding freshwater and groundwater (Toufexi et al. 2013; Kamal et al. 2016; Mishra et al. 2019). Leachate is the aqueous effluent generated from solid waste owing to their physical, chemical, and biological alteration in landfills (Youcai 2018) and is considered as a chemical soup of dissolved organic matter (DOM), xenobiotic organic compounds, different anions and cations, and heavy metals (Christensen et al. 2001). Among the different component of landfill leachate, the heavy metals are non-biodegradable, able to deteriorate the surface and groundwater quality and toxic even at low level to biological system (Fergusson 1991; Akpor 2014; Gautam et al. 2014; Verma 2017). Heavy metals are also persistent, bio-accumulative, and toxic as well as endocrine disrupting and carcinogenic (Kibria et al. 2016). Conversely, the DOM which constitute a large portion of leachate, has potential to bind with heavy metal, and consequently plays a significant role in the bioavailability of those metals in the aquatic environments (Baun and Christensen 2004; Rikta et al. 2018).\nThe principal concern about municipal landfill is focused on the pollution potential due to mobilization of the generated leachate through the subsoil into the surface and groundwater (Kjeldsen et al. 2002; Fadhullah et al. 2019; Mishra et al. 2019). Further, during the wet season, water containing leachate from landfill site drains into the nearby lowlands and surface water bodies and pollutes the local environments (Hossain et al. 2018). Hence, this toxic aqueous effluent from landfill site can causes potential risks to surface and groundwater (Christensen et al. 2001; Vaccari et al. 2019) and eventually found to poses a threat for aquatic biota, plant and public health (Toufexi et al. 2013). Iswa, (2013) reported that in most of the developing countries, improperly managed open landfill sites are more commonly practiced than controlled and engineered landfills. Residents, especially the urban and semi urban poor in those countries are affected severely by this uncontrolled management of waste via water and food contamination by toxic leachate.\nBangladesh, as an over populated country (164 million in 2020, www.Worldometers.info) generated around 8000 tons of solid waste each day (Abedin and Jahiruddin 2015) and disposed the solid waste in an uncontrolled manner (DNCC 2016). To the best of our knowledges, very few studies have conducted to assess systematically the contamination level of landfill leachate around different landfill sites in Bangladesh (Jahan et al. 2016; Kamal et al. 2016; Hossain et al. 2018; Alam et al. 2020). Moreover, none of the study analyzed properly the level of leachate pollution potential of landfill sites of Bangladesh and to which extent leachate contaminates the groundwater and surface water. Furthermore, the municipal water supply system of Bangladesh is dependent mostly on ground water (78%) and to some extent on surface water (22%) (Khan 2019). Hence, it's significant to understand the contribution of landfill leachate in polluting surface and groundwater of Bangladesh especially urban and sub-urban areas is urgently required.\nGiven the importance of the above issues, it is decisive to do more detailed systematic review and meta-analyses on leachate characteristics, especially the heavy metal and organic pollutants in sanitary landfills and dumpsites from different l\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Residents, especially the urban and semi urban poor in those countries are affected severely by this uncontrolled management of waste via water and food contamination by toxic leachate.\nBangladesh, as an over populated country (164 million in 2020, www.Worldometers.info) generated around 8000 tons of solid waste each day (Abedin and Jahiruddin 2015) and disposed the solid waste in an uncontrolled manner (DNCC 2016). To the best of our knowledges, very few studies have conducted to assess systematically the contamination level of landfill leachate around different landfill sites in Bangladesh (Jahan et al. 2016; Kamal et al. 2016; Hossain et al. 2018; Alam et al. 2020). Moreover, none of the study analyzed properly the level of leachate pollution potential of landfill sites of Bangladesh and to which extent leachate contaminates the groundwater and surface water. Furthermore, the municipal water supply system of Bangladesh is dependent mostly on ground water (78%) and to some extent on surface water (22%) (Khan 2019). Hence, it's significant to understand the contribution of landfill leachate in polluting surface and groundwater of Bangladesh especially urban and sub-urban areas is urgently required.\nGiven the importance of the above issues, it is decisive to do more detailed systematic review and meta-analyses on leachate characteristics, especially the heavy metal and organic pollutants in sanitary landfills and dumpsites from different l\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Marine debris is litter that ends up in oceans, seas, and other large bodies of water.\nThe Great Pacific Garbage Patch, also known as the Pacific trash vortex, spans waters from the West Coast of North America to Japan. The patch is actually comprised of the Western Garbage Patch, located near Japan, and the Eastern Garbage Patch, located between the U.S. states of Hawai'i and California.\nThese areas of spinning debris are linked together by the North Pacific Subtropical Convergence Zone, located a few hundred kilometers north of Hawai'i. This convergence zone is where warm water from the South Pacific meets up with cooler water from the Arctic. The zone acts like a highway that moves debris from one patch to another.\nThe entire Great Pacific Garbage Patch is bounded by the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) defines a gyre as a large system of swirling ocean currents. Increasingly, however, it also refers to the garbage patch as a vortex of plastic waste and debris broken down into small particles in the ocean. The North Pacific Subtropical Gyre is formed by four currents rotating clockwise around an area of 20 million square kilometers (7.7 million square miles): the California current, the North Equatorial current, the Kuroshio current, and the North Pacific current.\nThe area in the center of a gyre tends to be very calm and stable. The circular motion of the gyre draws debris into this stable center, where it becomes trapped. A plastic water bottle discarded off the coast of California, for instance, takes the California Current south toward Mexico. There, it may catch the North Equatorial Current, which crosses the vast Pacific. Near the coast of Japan, the bottle may travel north on the powerful Kuroshiro Current. Finally, the bottle travels eastward on the North Pacific Current. The gently rolling vortexes of the Eastern and Western Garbage Patches gradually draw in the bottle.\nThe amount of debris in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch accumulates because much of it is not biodegradable. Many plastics, for instance, do not wear down; they simply break into tinier and tinier pieces.\nFor many people, the idea of a \u201cgarbage patch\u201d conjures up images of an island of trash floating on the ocean. In reality, these patches are almost entirely made up of tiny bits of plastic, called microplastics. Microplastics can\u2019t always be seen by the naked eye. Even satellite imagery doesn\u2019t show a giant patch of garbage. The microplastics of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch can simply make the water look like a cloudy soup. This soup is intermixed with larger items, such as fishing gear and shoes.\nThe seafloor beneath the Great Pacific Garbage Patch may also be an underwater trash heap. Oceanographers and ecologists recently discovered that about 70 percent of marine debris actually sinks to the bottom of the ocean.\nWhile oceanographers and climatologists predicted the existence of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, it was a racing boat captain by the name of Charles Moore who actually discovered the trash vortex. Moore was sailing from Hawai'i to California after competing in a yachting race. Crossing the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, Moore and his crew noticed millions of pieces of plastic surrounding his ship.\nMarine Debris\nNo one knows how much debris makes up the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. The North Pacific Subtropical Gyre is too large for scientists to trawl. In addition, not all of the trash floats on the surface. Denser debris can sink centimeters or even several meters beneath the surface, making the vortex\u2019s area nearly impossible to measure.\n80 percent of plastic in the ocean is estimated to come from land-based sources, with the remaining 20 percent coming from boats and other marine sources. These percentages vary by region, however. A 2018 study found that synthetic fishing nets made up nearly half the mass of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, due largely to ocean current dynamics and increased fishing activity in the Pacific Ocean.\nWhile many different types of trash enter the ocean, plastics make up the majority of marine debris for two reasons. First, plastic\u2019s durability, low cost, and malleability mean that it\u2019s being used in more and more consumer and industrial products. Second, plastic goods do not biodegrade but instead, break down into smaller pieces.\nIn the ocean, the sun breaks down these plastics into tinier and tinier pieces, a process known as photodegradation. Most of this debris comes from plastic bags, bottle caps, plastic water bottles, and Styrofoam cups.\nMarine debris can be very harmful to marine life in the gyre. For instance, loggerhead sea turtles often mistake plastic bags for jellies, their favorite food. Albatrosses mistake plastic resin pellets for fish eggs and feed them to chicks, which die of starvation or ruptured organs.\nSeals and other marine mammals are especially at risk. They can get entangled in abandoned plastic fishing nets, which are being discarded largely due to inclement weather and illegal fishing. Seals and other mammals often drown in these forgotten nets\u2014a phenomenon known as \u201cghost fishing.\u201d\nMarine debris can also disturb marine food webs in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. As microplastics and other trash collect on or near the surface of the ocean, they block sunlight from reaching plankton and algae below.

Analysis of rafting plastic debris in the eastern North Pacific Subtropical Gyre revealed 37 coastal invertebrate taxa, largely of Western Pacific origin, exceeding pelagic taxa richness by threefold. Coastal taxa, including diverse taxonomic groups and life history traits, occurred on 70.5% of debris items. Most coastal taxa possessed either direct development or asexual reproduction, possibly facilitating long-term persistence on rafts. Our results suggest that the historical lack of available substrate limited the colonization of the open ocean by coastal species, rather than physiological or ecological constraints as previously assumed. It appears that coastal species persist now in the open ocean as a substantial component of a neopelagic community sustained by the vast and expanding sea of plastic debris.\u201d\nDespite increasing awareness of microplastic contamination, scientific research specifically addressing landfills as active origins of microplastics remains scarce.\nMicroplastics are everywhere\u2014and that's raising urgent health questions, scientists say.\nNew research unveils the toxic supply chain driving global plastic production, shining new light on the critical players driving...\nThe Problem with Plastic by Judith Enck and Adam Mahoney critically examines the paradox of plastic, first celebrated for...\n\u00a9 2025 Plastic Pollution Coalition.

It is most commonly used in the context of land-filling of decomposable or industrial waste.\nIn the narrow environmental context leachate is therefore any liquid material that drains from land or stockpiled material and contains significantly elevated concentrations of undesirable material derived from the material that it has passed through.\nLeachate from a landfill varies widely in composition depending on the age of the landfill and the type of waste that it contains.[1][2] It usually contains both dissolved and suspended material. The generation of leachate is caused principally by precipitation percolating through waste deposited in a landfill. Once in contact with decomposing solid waste, the percolating water becomes contaminated, and if it then flows out of the waste material it is termed leachate.[3] Additional leachate volume is produced during this decomposition of carbonaceous material producing a wide range of other materials including methane, carbon dioxide and a complex mixture of organic acids, aldehydes, alcohols and simple sugars.\nThe risks of leachate generation can be mitigated by properly designed and engineered landfill sites, such as those that are constructed on geologically impermeable materials or sites that use impermeable liners made of geomembranes or engineered clay. The use of linings is now mandatory within the United States, Australia and the European Union except where the waste is deemed inert. In addition, most toxic and difficult materials are now specifically excluded from landfilling. However, despite much stricter statutory controls, leachates from modern sites are often found to contain a range of contaminants stemming from illegal activity or legally discarded household and domestic products.\nHeap leaching is an industrial mining process used to extract precious metals, copper, uranium, and other compounds from ore using a series of chemical reactions that absorb specific minerals and re-separate them after their division from other earth materials.

For food packaging, automotive components, construction materials, electronics, healthcare and medical applications, textiles and apparel, aerospace and defense, clean energy, and a variety of other products, researchers often turn to the polymer analysis and development process. Processes such as extrusion and compounding can help in the development of novel polymer materials with specific desired properties.\nPolymers are large molecules made up of repeating subunits called monomers. They are macromolecules composed of thousands or even millions of monomer units covalently bonded together in a chain-like structure. The process of joining these monomers together to form a polymer is known as polymerization. There are two types of polymers: synthetic polymers, which are man-made polymers that are produced through chemical reactions, and natural polymers, which are produced by living organisms through biological processes.\nThe formulation of modern polymer compounds can be quite complex and include many ingredients. Equipment that streamlines the polymer development process enables researchers to experiment with different materials while also ensuring consistent quality of products. The proper instrumentation can also help scientists transition from lab-scale compounding to large-scale production and help ensure that polymer materials comply with applicable standards and regulations. Advanced extrusion equipment can optimize compounding, facilitating the production of these complex polymer materials.\nWhether the aim is to optimize material usage, develop environmentally friendly new polymers, or guarantee consistent quality, material scientists look to overcome these challenges with leading technologies to conduct R&D more efficiently.\nPolymers can have diverse properties depending on their chemical structure and the arrangement of monomer units. Some common properties of polymers include flexibility, toughness, elasticity, thermal stability, electrical insulation, chemical resistance, and biocompatibility.\nSynthetic polymers are created by polymerizing monomers derived from petroleum and other raw materials. Examples of synthetic polymers include polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polystyrene (PS), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Synthetic polymers offer a wide range of properties and can be tailored to specific applications through modifications in their chemical structure.\nNatural polymers, as the name implies, are found in nature and are derived from renewable sources. They are produced by living organisms through biological processes. Examples of natural polymers include proteins (such as collagen and silk), nucleic acids (such as DNA and RNA), carbohydrates (such as cellulose and starch), and natural rubber. Natural polymers often exhibit unique properties and biocompatibility, making them suitable for various applications, including food, medicine, textiles, and cosmetics.\nThe virgin polymer development process involves several steps that are essential for creating a new polymer material. Here are the general steps involved:\nIt\u2019s important to note that the specific steps and processes involved in polymer development can vary depending on the intended properties, applications, and types of polymer being developed.\nThe diversity of plastics needed to meet the requirements of the broad range of potential applications is brought about through polymer compounding. Compounding is the process of formulating resins into customized materials by using one or more polymer resins with corresponding additives to meet the exact requirements of an application. For instance, in terms of physical requirements, it could mean developing a material with better heat resistance, greater strength, or more flexibility, or it could just mean ensuring the right coloring.\nA masterbatch is also a compound, consisting of at least two components that are mixed together using the extrusion process. The term \u201cmasterbatch\u201d refers to plastic additives in the form of granules with a higher content of colorants or additives than in the end application. They are added to the polymer to color it or to change its properties. Compared to powder additives, masterbatches increase technical process reliability and are easy to process.\nThe main compounding steps are feeding, melting, conveying, mixing, venting, and extrusion of the homogenized product. In the feed zone, solid material is fed by the volumetric or gravimetric feeder. Air is removed and low-density material is compacted. In the next step, the material is moved forward and heated up in a partially-filled, non-pressurized conveying section. In the first mixing zone, the material is melted and plasticized. The mixing zones are filled completely with material. Another conveying zone follows and can be used for venting, split feeding of fillers, or liquid feeding. Alternating mixing and conveying sections then follow to achieve a homogeneous product. The conveying screw elements within venting zones are used for venting volatiles and air, either at ambient pressure or by vacuum. Lastly, an extrusion section is used to build up pressure and shape the material. In most of the applications, a strand is extruded, which is then cooled in a water bath and cut into pellets.\nScientists in research and industry have been working on material development so they can modify compounds for better properties, for better re-usability or enhanced sustainability. A systematic development approach is needed to identify the best suited compound composition for a given application as well as to investigate the processability for production of novel mate\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The research, published in the journal PLOS One, is the first study to look at plastics of all sizes in the world\u2019s oceans.\nLarge pieces of plastic can strangle animals such as seals, while smaller pieces are ingested by fish and then fed up the food chain, all the way to humans.\nThis is problematic due to the chemicals contained within plastics, as well as the pollutants that plastic attract once they are in the marine environment.\n\u201cWe saw turtles that ate plastic bags and fish that ingested fishing lines,\u201d said Julia Reisser, a researcher based at the University of Western Australia. \u201cBut there are also chemical impacts. When plastic gets into the water it acts like a magnet for oily pollutants.\n\u201cBigger fish eat the little fish and then they end up on our plates. It\u2019s hard to tell how much pollution is being ingested but certainly plastics are providing some of it.\u201d\nThe researchers collected small plastic fragments in nets, while larger pieces were observed from boats. The northern and southern sections of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans were surveyed, as well as the Indian ocean, the coast of Australia and the Bay of Bengal.\nThe vast amount of plastic, weighing 268,940 tonnes, includes everything from plastic bags to fishing gear debris.\nWhile spread out around the globe, much of this rubbish accumulates in five large ocean gyres, which are circular currents that churn up plastics in a set area. Each of the major oceans have plastic-filled gyres, including the well-known \u2018great Pacific garbage patch\u2019 that covers an area roughly equivalent to Texas.\nReisser said traversing the large rubbish-strewn gyres in a boat was like sailing through \u201cplastic soup.\u201d\n\u201cYou put a net through it for half an hour and there\u2019s more plastic than marine life there,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to visualise the sheer amount, but the weight of it is more than the entire biomass of humans. It\u2019s quite an alarming problem that\u2019s likely to get worse.\u201d\nThe research found that the gyres themselves are likely to contribute to the problem, acting as \u201cshredders\u201d to the plastic before dispersing it.\n\u201cOur findings show that the garbage patches in the middle of the five subtropical gyres are not the final resting places for the world\u2019s floating plastic trash,\u201d said Marcus Eriksen, another of the report\u2019s co-authors. \u201cThe endgame for micro-plastic is interactions with entire ocean ecosystems.\u201d\nThe research, the first of its kind to pull together data on floating plastic from around the world, will be used to chart future trends in the amount of debris in the oceans.\nBut researchers predict the volume will increase due to rising production of throwaway plastic, with only 5% of the world\u2019s plastic currently recycled.\n\u201cLots of things are used once and then not recycled,\u201d Reisser said. \u201cWe need to improve our use of plastic and also monitor plastics in the oceans so we get a better understanding of the issue.\n\u201cI\u2019m optimistic but we need to get policy makers to understand the problem. Some are doing that \u2013 Germany has changed the policy so that manufacturers are responsible for the waste they produce. If we put more responsibility on to the producer then that would be part of the solution.\u201d\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Since over 60 million plastic water bottles are thrown away each day in the US, we want to go deeper into the lifecycle of creating a plastic bottle.\nOnly 1% of water bottles are imported, therefore, nearly all bottled water sold in the United States are sourced domestically.\nCrude oil \u2013 used to make polyethylene terephthalate (PET), the main component of a plastic bottle due to it being both strong and light\u2013 is removed from the earth through large-scale extraction processes, such as mining, drilling, or fracking. In the United States specifically, crude oil is produced in 32 states and in US coastal waters.\nThe extracted oil is then shipped to a refinery where the crude oil undergoes its next step, distillation.\nThe distillation process separates the crude oil into components, called fractions. Each fraction that is separated is a mixture of hydrocarbon chains. The fractions differ in size and structure of molecules and are generally separated into three categories: light, middle, and heavy fractions.\nLight fractions result in hydrocarbons: gasoline, naphtha, kerosene, jet fuel, and paraffin. Medium fractions result in diesel fuel and gas oil. Heavy fractions result in fuel oil. PET is produced from naphtha from the light fractions of hydrocarbons. Naphtha is used to produce the base molecules, called monomers, that makeup PET. Two monomers \u2013 monoethylene glycol (MEG) and dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) or purified terephthalic acid (PTA), are chemically combined to produce a long, chain-like molecule, the polymer PET, in the form of a pellet. These pellets are melted together using high heat and pressure. Then these resins are injected into a mold of a small tube, called a preform. Once heated back up, air is blown to expand the tube open, similarly to a balloon.\nAs it cools down, the plastic water bottle is formed. The bottles are filled with water and sealed for use in the bottling process. These bottles are then transported to grocery stores and other suppliers to be bought by consumers.\nCurrently 30% of water bottles consumed are never put into a recycling bin despite all the work and energy it takes to make a plastic water bottle.\nWhen plastic water bottles and other plastics are collected for recycling, they are taken to a materials recovery facility. All the items are moved onto a disk screen where materials are separated from one another.\nPlastics are sorted by categories and by type. Once enough items (not just bottles) made from plastic #1 are collected, they are packed into a large bale and taken to a reclaiming plant where they undergo mechanical recycling. Here, the plastic is shredded into small pieces, sorted, and washed. The small pieces are heated to create small resin to make more plastic material. Mechanical recycling starts and ends with a polymer product \u2013 however, the long polymer chains are broken down into smaller pieces, limiting the repeatability of the mechanical recycling process.\nIn fact, recycled PET is often used to make textiles instead of new bottles. To solve this problem, companies are developing processes to recreate the monomers or hydrocarbons used to make plastic. With PET, organizations are developing depolymerization to regenerate monomers which can replace crude oil and make new plastic material.\nWhen plastic bottles are not recycled, they are sent to landfill where they can take up to 1,000 years to decompose. Moreover, products made from recycled bottles, such as clothing, often end up in landfills as they cannot be recycled with today\u2019s infrastructure.\nAs we continue to look at our plastic consumption, there are many ways individuals and businesses can reduce dependency.

Do they get made into ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nPlastic is everywhere\u2014food packaging, furniture, and children\u2019s toys\u2014making it a defining material of the modern world. According to Greenpeace, humanity produced approximately 9.2 billion tonnes of this material as of the 1950s. In 2019, that number was 368 million tonnes, and only 9% was recycled.\nThis low recycling rate highlights significant challenges, from inefficient systems to the complexity of recycling different types of plastics. Despite this, technological advancements and growing awareness pave the way for more effective solutions. Communities, businesses, and governments are working with RTS and institutions to address the problem and develop better recycling methods.\nLet\u2019s explore how to recycle plastics and how we can contribute to the evolution toward a sustainable future.\nPlastic recycling is vital in managing waste and creating a more sustainable future. It supports a circular economy, which reduces waste and reuses materials. Plastic waste has severe impacts on our environment, health, and economy. For example, microplastics pollute our oceans and even enter the food we eat. In addition, plastic pollution costs industries like fishing and tourism an estimated $2.5 trillion annually. These facts highlight just how urgent it is to address this problem.\nStill, solving the plastic waste crisis isn\u2019t easy. Many people don\u2019t fully understand how big the problem is. Efforts to tackle it have often faced resistance, especially from industries that profit from plastic production.\nWhile concerns about plastic waste were first raised in the 1960s, progress has been slow. Thankfully, things are starting to change with RTS at the forefront. We have a webinar on compostable plastics, which you can download to spread awareness of the subject.\nBecause of such initiatives, more people and businesses are learning about the issue, recycling plastic, and making sustainable choices. This growing awareness gives hope for a cleaner, healthier planet.\nToday, consumers and businesses are trying to recycle more, but many lack the knowledge to do it correctly. This often leads to problems like contamination. For instance, mixing non-recyclable plastics with recyclable ones or attempting to recycle plastics with food residue, chemicals, or adhesives can disrupt the recycling process. These mistakes often send plastics to landfills instead of being recycled.\nAnother challenge lies in the products themselves. Items like water bottles, usually made from a single type of plastic (such as PETE), are easier to recycle. However, many products are made from a combination of plastics or a mix of plastics and other materials like metal or wood. These mixed-material items cannot be processed in most recycling facilities and often become waste.\nDespite these challenges, plastic recycling has improved significantly in recent years. The process can now be broken down into six steps, making it more efficient and effective.\nJust like any other waste RTS deals with, we have a process for recycling plastics. Those steps are as follows:\nIn this step, collectors from the government or private companies gather all post-consumer materials from establishments like homes, schools, and other institutions.\nSorting entails grouping plastics into their respective types. Beyond chemical composition, sorting is also done by color, thickness, and usage. This step can be done manually or by machines at recycling plants.\nWashing is the process of removing all the impurities that may impede the following processes. Here, product labels, adhesives, and food residue are removed.\nAfter washing comes shredding, which is basically breaking down the sorted and washed plastics into smaller-sized pieces. In this state, they might be used as additives within asphalt or sold as a raw material. Shredding also allows the removal of more impurities like metals.\nHere, plastics are tested for their class and quality. So, they are first segregated based on density, where testing is done by floatation on water. The next process is called air classification, where plastics are categorized based on thickness. Air classification occurs in a wind tunnel\u2014thinner pieces float while thicker ones stay at the bottom.\nThe final stage of plastic recycling is when the plastics are crushed and melted to form pallets called nurdles. After they become nurdles, they are transformed to take a new shape to make a new product. Please note that different classes of plastics might need specific plants to finalize this step.\nRecycling labels on plastic packaging are designed to help people sort and recycle their waste correctly. However, these symbols can often be confusing. Knowing what they mean can significantly affect how effectively we recycle. Let\u2019s break down some of the most common labels and what they tell us about plastic packaging.\nThe Mobius Loop is a triangle made of three arrows. If you see this symbol, it means the item is recyclable. However, it doesn\u2019t guarantee that it can be recycled everywhere. Recycling programs vary by location, so confirm with your local recycling center.\nThe triangle symbol often includes a number from 1 to 7. This is called the Resin Identification Code, which tells you the type of plastic used.\nThe Green Dot doesn\u2019t mean the item is recyclable. Instead, it shows that the manufacturer contributes to recycling programs.\nSome packaging includes phrases like \u201cWidely Recycled\u201d or \u201cCheck Locally.\u201d These are guidelines about whether the item can be recycled in most places or only in specific areas.\nUnderstanding these labels helps you sort waste correctly and avoid contamination in recycling bins. When in doubt, check local guidelines or ask your recycling provider. Following these simple steps contributes to a cleaner, more sustainable future.\nPlastics are categorized into seven classes.

Crude oil is a complex mixture of thousands of compounds and needs to be processed before it can be used. The production of plastics begins with the distillation of crude oil in an oil refinery. This separates the heavy crude oil into groups of lighter components, called fractions.

According to Greenpeace, humanity produced approximately 9.2 billion tonnes of this material as of the 1950s. In 2019, that number was 368 million tonnes, and only 9% was recycled.\nThis low recycling rate highlights significant challenges, from inefficient systems to the complexity of recycling different types of plastics. Despite this, technological advancements and growing awareness pave the way for more effective solutions. Communities, businesses, and governments are working with RTS and institutions to address the problem and develop better recycling methods.\nLet\u2019s explore how to recycle plastics and how we can contribute to the evolution toward a sustainable future.\nPlastic recycling is vital in managing waste and creating a more sustainable future. It supports a circular economy, which reduces waste and reuses materials. Plastic waste has severe impacts on our environment, health, and economy. For example, microplastics pollute our oceans and even enter the food we eat. In addition, plastic pollution costs industries like fishing and tourism an estimated $2.5 trillion annually. These facts highlight just how urgent it is to address this problem.\nStill, solving the plastic waste crisis isn\u2019t easy. Many people don\u2019t fully understand how big the problem is. Efforts to tackle it have often faced resistance, especially from industries that profit from plastic production.\nWhile concerns about plastic waste were first raised in the 1960s, progress has been slow. Thankfully, things are starting to change with RTS at the forefront. We have a webinar on compostable plastics, which you can download to spread awareness of the subject.\nBecause of such initiatives, more people and businesses are learning about the issue, recycling plastic, and making sustainable choices. This growing awareness gives hope for a cleaner, healthier planet.\nToday, consumers and businesses are trying to recycle more, but many lack the knowledge to do it correctly. This often leads to problems like contamination. For instance, mixing non-recyclable plastics with recyclable ones or attempting to recycle plastics with food residue, chemicals, or adhesives can disrupt the recycling process. These mistakes often send plastics to landfills instead of being recycled.\nAnother challenge lies in the products themselves. Items like water bottles, usually made from a single type of plastic (such as PETE), are easier to recycle. However, many products are made from a combination of plastics or a mix of plastics and other materials like metal or wood. These mixed-material items cannot be processed in most recycling facilities and often become waste.\nDespite these challenges, plastic recycling has improved significantly in recent years. The process can now be broken down into six steps, making it more efficient and effective.\nJust like any other waste RTS deals with, we have a process for recycling plastics. Those steps are as follows:\nIn this step, collectors from the government or private companies gather all post-consumer materials from establishments like homes, schools, and other institutions.\nSorting entails grouping plastics into their respective types. Beyond chemical composition, sorting is also done by color, thickness, and usage. This step can be done manually or by machines at recycling plants.\nWashing is the process of removing all the impurities that may impede the following processes. Here, product labels, adhesives, and food residue are removed.\nAfter washing comes shredding, which is basically breaking down the sorted and washed plastics into smaller-sized pieces. In this state, they might be used as additives within asphalt or sold as a raw material. Shredding also allows the removal of more impurities like metals.\nHere, plastics are tested for their class and quality. So, they are first segregated based on density, where testing is done by floatation on water. The next process is called air classification, where plastics are categorized based on thickness. Air classification occurs in a wind tunnel\u2014thinner pieces float while thicker ones stay at the bottom.\nThe final stage of plastic recycling is when the plastics are crushed and melted to form pallets called nurdles. After they become nurdles, they are transformed to take a new shape to make a new product. Please note that different classes of plastics might need specific plants to finalize this step.\nRecycling labels on plastic packaging are designed to help people sort and recycle their waste correctly. However, these symbols can often be confusing. Knowing what they mean can significantly affect how effectively we recycle. Let\u2019s break down some of the most common labels and what they tell us about plastic packaging.\nThe Mobius Loop is a triangle made of three arrows. If you see this symbol, it means the item is recyclable. However, it doesn\u2019t guarantee that it can be recycled everywhere. Recycling programs vary by location, so confirm with your local recycling center.\nThe triangle symbol often includes a number from 1 to 7. This is called the Resin Identification Code, which tells you the type of plastic used.\nThe Green Dot doesn\u2019t mean the item is recyclable. Instead, it shows that the manufacturer contributes to recycling programs.\nSome packaging includes phrases like \u201cWidely Recycled\u201d or \u201cCheck Locally.\u201d These are guidelines about whether the item can be recycled in most places or only in specific areas.\nUnderstanding these labels helps you sort waste correctly and avoid contamination in recycling bins. When in doubt, check local guidelines or ask your recycling provider. Following these simple steps contributes to a cleaner, more sustainable future.\nPlastics are categorized into seven classes.

People love to recycle, but most people don't realize a typical batch of plastic material can only be melted down once or twice before they're no longer usable at all from chemical breakdown under high temperature. You may run into this. Don't expect your reused plastic to behave as well as the original feedstock.\nI'm a little curious as to what you want to build out of plastic. One of the issues with making things out of plastic is the high viscosity of the polymer melt, which means that you usually need machinery that can generate a ton of pressure to force the polymer into a mold. Simply pouring a molten polymer into something like a sand cast mold won't work, as the viscosity is too high for gravity to overcome.\nRemember that polymers are very unlike other materials like metal or ceramics. Polymers at the atomic scale look like giant strands of spaghetti that get tangled up in each other and make it difficult to move. When companies buy polymer material to make their plastic bottles out of, they carefully pick material with a well-defined length of the polymer chains. This means that their particular water bottle will have consistent properties and hold together. When you melt a bunch of plastic bottles together, though, you'll be getting material with all different chain lengths, which will do screwy things and make it difficult to actually form something.\nI would certainly stick to reclaiming plastic objects used for food things from a safety perspective. Polymers used for other things typically incorporate plasticizers and low-molecular weight compounds to improve the mechanical properties of the material. However, food-safe stuff should be generally safe to melt (and burn).\nIf the 250C melting temperature for PET is too hot for you to work with, try high density polyethylene (HDPE), used in milk jugs. Ensure anything you try to melt is a thermoplastic (will melt) and not a thermoset (will not melt - just will burn). Don't melt PVC or any other halogenated polymers (PVDF/PTFE) - if it is non-stick, don't screw with it.\nI agree with L4NGOS, stick to one material at a time. Some people have gone before you. You might get some ideas from these links for plastic filament extruders; although, I'm not saying either of these is the solution you are looking for. http://www.instructables.com/id/Build-your-own-3d-printing-filament-factory-Filame/ http://www.filabot.com/\nRecycle plastic is usually melted in and then extruded through a pelletizer for use in an injection molding machine.

According to Greenpeace, humanity produced approximately 9.2 billion tonnes of this material as of the 1950s. In 2019, that number was 368 million tonnes, and only 9% was recycled.\nThis low recycling rate highlights significant challenges, from inefficient systems to the complexity of recycling different types of plastics. Despite this, technological advancements and growing awareness pave the way for more effective solutions. Communities, businesses, and governments are working with RTS and institutions to address the problem and develop better recycling methods.\nLet\u2019s explore how to recycle plastics and how we can contribute to the evolution toward a sustainable future.\nPlastic recycling is vital in managing waste and creating a more sustainable future. It supports a circular economy, which reduces waste and reuses materials. Plastic waste has severe impacts on our environment, health, and economy. For example, microplastics pollute our oceans and even enter the food we eat. In addition, plastic pollution costs industries like fishing and tourism an estimated $2.5 trillion annually. These facts highlight just how urgent it is to address this problem.\nStill, solving the plastic waste crisis isn\u2019t easy. Many people don\u2019t fully understand how big the problem is. Efforts to tackle it have often faced resistance, especially from industries that profit from plastic production.\nWhile concerns about plastic waste were first raised in the 1960s, progress has been slow. Thankfully, things are starting to change with RTS at the forefront. We have a webinar on compostable plastics, which you can download to spread awareness of the subject.\nBecause of such initiatives, more people and businesses are learning about the issue, recycling plastic, and making sustainable choices. This growing awareness gives hope for a cleaner, healthier planet.\nToday, consumers and businesses are trying to recycle more, but many lack the knowledge to do it correctly. This often leads to problems like contamination. For instance, mixing non-recyclable plastics with recyclable ones or attempting to recycle plastics with food residue, chemicals, or adhesives can disrupt the recycling process. These mistakes often send plastics to landfills instead of being recycled.\nAnother challenge lies in the products themselves. Items like water bottles, usually made from a single type of plastic (such as PETE), are easier to recycle. However, many products are made from a combination of plastics or a mix of plastics and other materials like metal or wood. These mixed-material items cannot be processed in most recycling facilities and often become waste.\nDespite these challenges, plastic recycling has improved significantly in recent years. The process can now be broken down into six steps, making it more efficient and effective.\nJust like any other waste RTS deals with, we have a process for recycling plastics. Those steps are as follows:\nIn this step, collectors from the government or private companies gather all post-consumer materials from establishments like homes, schools, and other institutions.\nSorting entails grouping plastics into their respective types. Beyond chemical composition, sorting is also done by color, thickness, and usage. This step can be done manually or by machines at recycling plants.\nWashing is the process of removing all the impurities that may impede the following processes. Here, product labels, adhesives, and food residue are removed.\nAfter washing comes shredding, which is basically breaking down the sorted and washed plastics into smaller-sized pieces. In this state, they might be used as additives within asphalt or sold as a raw material. Shredding also allows the removal of more impurities like metals.\nHere, plastics are tested for their class and quality. So, they are first segregated based on density, where testing is done by floatation on water. The next process is called air classification, where plastics are categorized based on thickness. Air classification occurs in a wind tunnel\u2014thinner pieces float while thicker ones stay at the bottom.\nThe final stage of plastic recycling is when the plastics are crushed and melted to form pallets called nurdles. After they become nurdles, they are transformed to take a new shape to make a new product. Please note that different classes of plastics might need specific plants to finalize this step.\nRecycling labels on plastic packaging are designed to help people sort and recycle their waste correctly. However, these symbols can often be confusing. Knowing what they mean can significantly affect how effectively we recycle. Let\u2019s break down some of the most common labels and what they tell us about plastic packaging.\nThe Mobius Loop is a triangle made of three arrows. If you see this symbol, it means the item is recyclable. However, it doesn\u2019t guarantee that it can be recycled everywhere. Recycling programs vary by location, so confirm with your local recycling center.\nThe triangle symbol often includes a number from 1 to 7. This is called the Resin Identification Code, which tells you the type of plastic used.\nThe Green Dot doesn\u2019t mean the item is recyclable. Instead, it shows that the manufacturer contributes to recycling programs.\nSome packaging includes phrases like \u201cWidely Recycled\u201d or \u201cCheck Locally.\u201d These are guidelines about whether the item can be recycled in most places or only in specific areas.\nUnderstanding these labels helps you sort waste correctly and avoid contamination in recycling bins. When in doubt, check local guidelines or ask your recycling provider. Following these simple steps contributes to a cleaner, more sustainable future.\nPlastics are categorized into seven classes. You may have already seen these symbols on products but perhaps never paid attention. While they look like the \u201crecycling symbol,\u201d they indicate \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This growing awareness gives hope for a cleaner, healthier planet.\nToday, consumers and businesses are trying to recycle more, but many lack the knowledge to do it correctly. This often leads to problems like contamination. For instance, mixing non-recyclable plastics with recyclable ones or attempting to recycle plastics with food residue, chemicals, or adhesives can disrupt the recycling process. These mistakes often send plastics to landfills instead of being recycled.\nAnother challenge lies in the products themselves. Items like water bottles, usually made from a single type of plastic (such as PETE), are easier to recycle. However, many products are made from a combination of plastics or a mix of plastics and other materials like metal or wood. These mixed-material items cannot be processed in most recycling facilities and often become waste.\nDespite these challenges, plastic recycling has improved significantly in recent years. The process can now be broken down into six steps, making it more efficient and effective.\nJust like any other waste RTS deals with, we have a process for recycling plastics. Those steps are as follows:\nIn this step, collectors from the government or private companies gather all post-consumer materials from establishments like homes, schools, and other institutions.\nSorting entails grouping plastics into their respective types. Beyond chemical composition, sorting is also done by color, thickness, and usage. This step can be done manually or by machines at recycling plants.\nWashing is the process of removing all the impurities that may impede the following processes. Here, product labels, adhesives, and food residue are removed.\nAfter washing comes shredding, which is basically breaking down the sorted and washed plastics into smaller-sized pieces. In this state, they might be used as additives within asphalt or sold as a raw material. Shredding also allows the removal of more impurities like metals.\nHere, plastics are tested for their class and quality. So, they are first segregated based on density, where testing is done by floatation on water. The next process is called air classification, where plastics are categorized based on thickness. Air classification occurs in a wind tunnel\u2014thinner pieces float while thicker ones stay at the bottom.\nThe final stage of plastic recycling is when the plastics are crushed and melted to form pallets called nurdles. After they become nurdles, they are transformed to take a new shape to make a new product. Please note that different classes of plastics might need specific plants to finalize this step.\nRecycling labels on plastic packaging are designed to help people sort and recycle their waste correctly. However, these symbols can often be confusing. Knowing what they mean can significantly affect how effectively we recycle. Let\u2019s break down some of the most common labels and what they tell us about plastic packaging.\nThe Mobius Loop is a triangle made of three arrows. If you see this symbol, it means the item is recyclable. However, it doesn\u2019t guarantee that it can be recycled everywhere. Recycling programs vary by location, so confirm with your local recycling center.\nThe triangle symbol often includes a number from 1 to 7. This is called the Resin Identification Code, which tells you the type of plastic used.\nThe Green Dot doesn\u2019t mean the item is recyclable. Instead, it shows that the manufacturer contributes to recycling programs.\nSome packaging includes phrases like \u201cWidely Recycled\u201d or \u201cCheck Locally.\u201d These are guidelines about whether the item can be recycled in most places or only in specific areas.\nUnderstanding these labels helps you sort waste correctly and avoid contamination in recycling bins. When in doubt, check local guidelines or ask your recycling provider. Following these simple steps contributes to a cleaner, more sustainable future.\nPlastics are categorized into seven classes. You may have already seen these symbols on products but perhaps never paid attention. While they look like the \u201crecycling symbol,\u201d they indicate \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",
