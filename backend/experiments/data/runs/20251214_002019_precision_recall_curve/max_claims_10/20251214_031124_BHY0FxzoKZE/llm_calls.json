    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nWhat if I told you there was something that you can do right now that would have an immediate, positive benefit for your brain including your mood and your focus? And what if I told you that same thing could actually last a long time and protect your brain from different conditions like depression, Alzheimer's disease or dementia. Would you do it? Yes! I am talking about the powerful effects of physical activity. Simply moving your body, has immediate, long-lasting and protective benefits for your brain. And that can last for the rest of your life. So what I want to do today is tell you a story about how I used my deep understanding of neuroscience, as a professor of neuroscience, to essentially do an experiment on myself in which I discovered the science underlying why exercise is the most transformative thing that you can do for your brain today. Now, as a neuroscientist, I know that our brains, that is the thing in our head right now, that is the most complex structure known to humankind. But it's one thing to talk about the brain, and it's another to see it. So here is a real preserved human brain. And it's going to illustrate two key areas that we are going to talk about today. The first is the prefrontal cortex, right behind your forehead, critical for things like decision-making, focus, attention and your personality. The second key area is located in the temporal lobe, shown right here. You have two temporal lobes in your brain, the right and the left, and deep in the temporal lobe is a key structure critical for your ability to form and retain new long-term memories for facts and events. And that structure is called the hippocampus. So I've always been fascinated with the hippocampus. How could it be that an event that lasts just a moment, say, your first kiss, or the moment your first child was born, can form a memory that has changed your brain, that lasts an entire lifetime? That's what I want to understand. I wanted to start and record the activity of individual brain cells in the hippocampus as subjects were forming new memories. And essentially try and decode how those brief bursts of electrical activity, which is how neurons communicate with each other, how those brief bursts either allowed us to form a new memory, or did not. But a few years ago, I did something very unusual in science. As a full professor of neural science, I decided to completely switch my research program. Because I encountered something that was so amazing, with the potential to change so many lives that I had to study it. I discovered and I experienced the brain-changing effects of exercise. And I did it in a completely inadvertent way. I was actually at the height of all the memory work that I was doing -- data was pouring in, I was becoming known in my field for all of this memory work. And it should have been going great. It was, scientifically. But when I stuck my head out of my lab door, I noticed something. I had no social life. I spent too much time listening to those brain cells in a dark room, by myself. (Laughter) I didn't move my body at all. I had gained 25 pounds. And actually, it took me many years to realize it, I was actually miserable. And I shouldn't be miserable. And I went on a river-rafting trip -- by myself, because I had no social life. And I came back -- (Laughter) thinking, \"Oh, my God, I was the weakest person on that trip.\" And I came back with a mission. I said, \"I'm never going to feel like the weakest person on a river-rafting trip again.\" And that's what made me go to the gym. And I focused my type-A personality on going to all the exercise classes at the gym. I tried everything. I went to kickbox, dance, yoga, step class, and at first it was really hard. But what I noticed is that after every sweat-inducing workout that I tried, I had this great mood boost and this great energy boost. And that's what kept me going back to the gym. Well, I started feeling stronger. I started feeling better, I even lost that 25 pounds. And now, fast-forward a year and a half into this regular exercise program and I noticed something that really made me sit up and take notice. I was sitting at my desk, writing a research grant, and a thought went through my mind that had never gone through my mind before. And that thought was, \"Gee, grant-writing is going well today.\" And all the scientists -- (Laughter) yeah, all the scientists always laugh when I say that, because grant-writing never goes well. It is so hard; you're always pulling your hair out, trying to come up with that million-dollar-winning idea. But I realized that the grant-writing was going well, because I was able to focus and maintain my attention for longer than I had before. And my long-term memory -- what I was studying in my own lab -- seemed to be better in me. And that's when I put it together. Maybe all that exercise that I had included and added to my life was changing my brain. Maybe I did an experiment on myself without even knowing it. So as a curious neuroscientist, I went to the literature to see what I could find about what we knew about the effects of exercise on the brain. And what I found was an exciting and a growing literature that was essentially showing everything that I noticed in myself. Better mood, better energy, better memory, better attention. And the more I learned, the more I realized how powerful exercise was. Which eventually led me to the big decision to completely shift my research focus. And so now, after several years of really focusing on this question, I've come to the following conclusion: that exercise is the most transformative thing that you can do for your brain today for the following three reasons. Number one: it has immediate effects on your brain. A single workout that you do will immediately increase levels of neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline. That is going to increase your mood right after that workout, exactly what I was feeling. My lab showed that a single workout can improve your ability to shift and focus attention, and that focus improvement will last for at least two hours. And finally, studies have shown that a single workout will improve your reaction times which basically means that you are going to be faster at catching that cup of Starbucks that falls off the counter, which is very, very important. (Laughter) But these immediate effects are transient, they help you right after. What you have to do is do what I did, that is change your exercise regime, increase your cardiorespiratory function, to get the long-lasting effects. And these effects are long-lasting because exercise actually changes the brain's anatomy, physiology and function. Let's start with my favorite brain area, the hippocampus. The hippocampus -- or exercise actually produces brand new brain cells, new brain cells in the hippocampus, that actually increase its volume, as well as improve your long-term memory, OK? And that including in you and me. Number two: the most common finding in neuroscience studies, looking at effects of long-term exercise, is improved attention function dependent on your prefrontal cortex. You not only get better focus and attention, but the volume of the hippocampus increases as well. And finally, you not only get immediate effects of mood with exercise but those last for a long time. So you get long-lasting increases in those good mood neurotransmitters. But really, the most transformative thing that exercise will do is its protective effects on your brain. Here you can think about the brain like a muscle. The more you're working out, the bigger and stronger your hippocampus and prefrontal cortex gets. Why is that important? Because the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus are the two areas that are most susceptible to neurodegenerative diseases and normal cognitive decline in aging. So with increased exercise over your lifetime, you're not going to cure dementia or Alzheimer's disease, but what you're going to do is you're going to create the strongest, biggest hippocampus and prefrontal cortex so it takes longer for these diseases to actually have an effect. You can think of exercise, therefore, as a supercharged 401K for your brain, OK? And it's even better, because it's free. So this is the point in the talk where everybody says, \"That sounds so interesting, Wendy, but I really will only want to know one thing. And that is, just tell me the minimum amount of exercise I need to get all these changes.\" (Laughter) And so I'm going to tell you the answer to that question. First, good news: you don't have to become a triathlete to get these effects. The rule of thumb is you want to get three to four times a week exercise minimum 30 minutes an exercise session, and you want to get aerobic exercise in. That is, get your heart rate up. And the good news is, you don't have to go to the gym to get a very expensive gym membership. Add an extra walk around the block in your power walk. You see stairs -- take stairs. And power-vacuuming can be as good as the aerobics class that you were going to take at the gym. So I've gone from memory pioneer to exercise explorer. From going into the innermost workings of the brain, to trying to understand how exercise can improve our brain function, and my goal in my lab right now is to go beyond that rule of thumb that I just gave you -- three to four times a week, 30 minutes. I want to understand the optimum exercise prescription for you, at your age, at your fitness level, for your genetic background, to maximize the effects of exercise today and also to improve your brain and protect your brain the best for the rest of your life. But it's one thing to talk about exercise, and it's another to do it. So I'm going to invoke my power as a certified exercise instructor, to ask you all to stand up. (Laughter) We're going to do just one minute of exercise. It's call-and-response, just do what I do, say what I say, and make sure you don't punch your neighbor, OK? Music! (Upbeat music) Five, six, seven, eight, it's right, left, right, left. And I say, I am strong now. Let's hear you. Audience: I am strong now. Wendy Suzuki: Ladies, I am Wonder Woman-strong. Let's hear you! Audience: I am Wonder Woman-strong. WS: New move -- uppercut, right and left. I am inspired now. You say it! Audience: I am inspired now. WS: Last move -- pull it down, right and left, right and left. I say, I am on fire now! You say it. Audience: I am on fire now. WS: And done! OK, good job! (Applause) Thank you. I want to leave you with one last thought. And that is, bringing exercise in your life will not only give you a happier, more protective life today, but it will protect your brain from incurable diseases. And in this way it will change the trajectory of your life for the better. Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)",

It helps you weigh pros and cons, set goals, and ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nPsychology \u00bb Biopsychology\nThe frontal lobe is one of the most important and largest parts of your brain. Located directly behind your forehead, it\u2019s critical for many complex activities that make us uniquely human, such as reasoning, planning, and social interaction.\nThe frontal lobe lies at the front of the brain, just behind the forehead.\nIt extends from the front of the cerebral cortex to the central sulcus, a deep groove that separates it from the parietal lobe. Beneath it lies the temporal lobe.\nThis lobe is divided into several key regions, including:\nThe frontal lobe is involved in many of the brain\u2019s most complex and vital functions.\nHave you ever wondered how you stay organized or control your impulses? You can thank your frontal lobe!\nThink of your frontal lobe as the control room of your brain\u2014it helps you make choices, plan your day, and keep your emotions balanced.\nIn fact, the frontal lobe handles many of your brain\u2019s most complex and vital functions.\nPsychologists call these executive functions, which include skills like managing your time, paying attention, and controlling your behavior.\nKey functions include:\nThe primary motor cortex (in the precentral gyrus) sends signals to muscles, enabling voluntary movements.\nIt is organized somatotopically, meaning different areas control different body parts.\nBroca\u2019s area, located in the left frontal lobe, helps form spoken words.\nDamage here can cause Broca\u2019s aphasia, where speech becomes effortful and broken.\nThe prefrontal cortex is central to abstract thinking, planning, and decision-making.\nIt helps you weigh pros and cons, set goals, and understand consequences.\nThis lobe also helps manage social behavior and emotional reactions.\nIt helps you feel empathy, keeps your impulses in check, and makes sure you act appropriately in social situations.\nWhen you accidentally snap at someone because you\u2019re tired or stressed, that\u2019s partly your frontal lobe struggling with emotional regulation.\nThe frontal lobe supports short-term memory (working memory) and attention, allowing you to focus and hold information temporarily for reasoning or calculations.\nThe frontal lobes \u2013 especially the prefrontal cortex (and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex)-are among the last brain areas to fully develop, undergoing major changes throughout adolescence and not reaching maturity until about age 25 (Arain et al., 2013).\nEver noticed how teenagers often take more risks? That\u2019s because their frontal lobes\u2014the brain\u2019s \u2018brakes\u2019 \u2013 haven\u2019t fully developed yet.\nMRI studies show that the frontal lobes fully mature around age 25, explaining why younger people might take more risks (Gogtay et al., 2004).\nBecause this region governs executive functions like planning, impulse control, and decision-making, its prolonged maturation helps explain why teens and young adults often exhibit more risk-taking and impulsivity.\nIn adolescence, reward-seeking circuits mature earlier than the frontal \u201cbrakes\u201d on behavior, creating a gap where young people have strong drives but limited impulse control (Romer, 2010).\nBy early adulthood, as the frontal lobes finish maturing, individuals typically develop stronger self-control, better judgment, and an improved ability to weigh consequences.\nDamage to the frontal lobe can dramatically affect personality, behavior, and cognitive abilities.\nPeople with frontal lobe damage might suddenly struggle with making decisions, controlling anger, or managing daily routines.\nDepending on the area affected, symptoms may include:\nFrontal lobe damage can result from traumatic brain injuries (TBI), strokes, tumors, or degenerative diseases like frontotemporal dementia.\nOne of the most well-known cases in neuroscience involves Phineas Gage, a railroad worker who survived a devastating brain injury in 1848. A large iron rod pierced his frontal lobe.\nGage lived, but his personality was reported to have changed. Once responsible and polite, he was now reported to be impulsive and rude.\nHis case revealed the importance of the frontal lobe in personality, self-regulation, and social behavior. It was a landmark in understanding the brain-behavior relationship.\nSeveral neurological and psychiatric conditions involve the frontal lobe:\nCaring for your frontal lobe means supporting brain health as a whole. Healthy lifestyle habits can strengthen cognitive function and help protect against decline:\nFor individuals affected by frontal lobe disorders, several therapeutic approaches can offer support:\nEarly intervention and consistent support can make a significant difference in managing symptoms and improving quality of life.\nArain, M., Haque, M., Johal, L., Mathur, P., Nel, W., Rais, A., \u2026 & Sharma, S.

The World Health Organization identifies it as the primary cause of disability worldwide, affecting over 264 million individuals. This condition can lead to enduring feelings of sadness and diminished interest in activities, significantly influencing an individual\u2019s daily life and overall well-being [1]. Modern treatment approaches for depression often involve psychotherapy, antidepressant medications, or a combination of these methods. Psychotherapies, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), target the modification of negative thought patterns and behaviors that play a role in depression. Antidepressant drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), work by adjusting the brain chemicals that influence mood and emotions. However, these methods have limitations. Psychotherapy can be time-consuming and expensive, and not all individuals have access to qualified therapists. The term \u2018qualified therapist\u2019 typically refers to a professional with specific credentials and training in psychotherapy. These qualifications often include advanced degrees in psychology, counseling, social work, or a related field, along with licensure or certification from relevant professional boards or organizations. Additionally, ongoing professional development and adherence to ethical guidelines are essential for maintaining one\u2019s status as a qualified therapist. Antidepressant medications may have side effects, take several weeks to show effect, and may not be effective for everyone. Moreover, the high cost of medication and the risk of addiction and dependency are concerns associated with antidepressant medication [2]. Millions of individuals worldwide suffer from depression, a common mental health condition that makes them feel low and uninterested in their activities. Current forms of treatment for depression such as psychotherapy and antidepressant drugs have drawbacks in terms of cost, accessibility, side effects, and different levels of efficacy. Therefore, investigating alternative methods for managing depression is required. Exercise is one such strategy that has shown promise in reducing depression symptoms.

These sequelae are interdependent, as depressive mood and cognitive impairment are two main factors influencing QoL [1, 2, 4-8], while cognition is negatively influenced by depression [9]. Moreover, these general sequelae are associated with various adverse consequences such as poor treatment compliance, loss of independence and even mortality [10]. In treatment of brain disorders, current clinical practice tends to focus on improving disease-specific symptoms (e.g., tremor and rigidity in Parkinson\u2019s disease, psychosis in schizophrenia). Notably, however, patients with brain disorders regard QoL and depressive mood as more important for their health status than disease-specific physical and mental symptoms [11]. Therefore, improvement of these common features should become an important target in treatment of chronic brain disorders.\nExercise therapy may positively affect QoL, depression and cognition across disorders. A leading example is stroke, in which physical exercise has shown favorable effects in improving a wide range of symptoms, such that it has now been incorporated and recommended in guidelines as part of the standard treatment [12\u201316]. In contrast, research on the efficacy of physical exercise in treatment of other brain disorders is still in its infancy and therefore not part of the standard care. Although several studies have investigated the effect of physical exercise in different chronic brain disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) [17, 18], multiple sclerosis (MS) [19\u201321], Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) [22, 23], Schizophrenia (Sz) [24, 25] and unipolar depression (UD) [26\u201328], results and mainly recommendations for clinical practice have been highly diverse [29]. As a consequence, current evidence for efficacy of exercise therapy is still disputed and exercise is not part of the regular care offer for patients with aforementioned disorders in most countries.\nOf note, the above-mentioned chronic brain disorders share underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. As such, neuroinflammation [30\u201333], imbalance in same neurotransmitter (e.g., dopamine in Sz and PD [34, 35], serotonin in Sz and UD [36]) and growth factors (e.g., brain-derived neurotrophic factor; BDNF) [37, 38], and disturbed connectivity (e.g., in default-mode network) [39\u201342] have been implicated in the pathophysiology of many of these brain disorders. Furthermore, a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) showed high degree of genetic overlap among many psychiatric disorders stating that the different psychiatric disorders do not reflect independent diseases but rather represent different overlapping phenotypes of the same clinical spectra [43].\nThe aforementioned shows how disease-specific research has de-emphasized and limited our understanding of substantial commonalities that exist across disorders. Considering the overlap in pathophysiology and clinical picture across chronic brain disorders, commonalities across disorders outweigh the differences indicating that transdiagnostic and disease-specific treatments might be at least equally effective. Therefore, by targeting the common functional relationships across disorders with transdiagnostic treatments, both disease-specific and common shared factors can be targeted during treatment. Physical exercise can be such a transdiagnostic treatment for chronic brain disorders.\nThe objective of this study is to quantitatively review the effect of additional physical exercise on QoL, depressive symptoms and cognition across the above-mentioned disorders. In addition, we aim to estimate the safety of exercise in aforementioned groups.

It is the association cortex in the frontal lobe.[2][3] This region is responsible for processing and adapting one's thinking in order to meet certain goals in different situations.[4] These processes of thinking can include the brain allowing one to focus, control how they behave, and make different decisions.[5]\nThe PFC contains the Brodmann areas BA8, BA9, BA10, BA11, BA12, BA13, BA14, BA24, BA25, BA32, BA44, BA45, BA46, and BA47.[1]\nThis brain region is involved in a wide range of higher-order cognitive functions, including speech formation (Broca's area), gaze (frontal eye fields), working memory (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), and risk processing (e.g. ventromedial prefrontal cortex). The basic activity of this brain region is considered to be orchestration of thoughts and actions in accordance with internal goals.[6] Many authors have indicated an integral link between a person's will to live, personality, and the functions of the prefrontal cortex.[7]\nThis brain region has been implicated in executive functions, such as planning, decision making, working memory, personality expression, moderating social behavior and controlling certain aspects of speech and language.[8][9][10][11] Executive function relates to abilities to differentiate among conflicting thoughts, determine good and bad, better and best, same and different, future consequences of current activities, working toward a defined goal, prediction of outcomes, expectation based on actions, and social \"control\" (the ability to suppress urges that, if not suppressed, could lead to socially unacceptable outcomes).\nThe frontal cortex supports concrete rule learning, with more anterior regions supporting rule learning at higher levels of abstraction.[12]\nThere are three possible ways to define the prefrontal cortex:[citation needed]\nThe prefrontal cortex has been defined based on cytoarchitectonics by the presence of a cortical granular layer IV. It is not entirely clear who first used this criterion. Many of the early cytoarchitectonic researchers restricted the use of the term prefrontal to a much smaller region of cortex including the gyrus rectus and the gyrus rostralis (Campbell, 1905; G. E. Smith, 1907; Brodmann, 1909; von Economo and Koskinas, 1925). In 1935, however, Jacobsen used the term prefrontal to distinguish granular prefrontal areas from agranular motor and premotor areas.[13] In terms of Brodmann areas, the prefrontal cortex traditionally includes areas 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 24, 25, 32, 44, 45, 46, and 47,[1] however, not all of these areas are strictly granular \u2013 44 is dysgranular, caudal 11 and orbital 47 are agranular.[14] The main problem with this definition is that it works well only in primates but not in nonprimates, as the latter lack a granular layer IV.[15] In a recent research study, scientists stimulated the amygdala area in monkeys, where they found that the auditory and prefrontal cortices got activated, which is similar to what happens in humans.[16]\nTo define the prefrontal cortex as the projection zone of the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus builds on the work of Rose and Woolsey,[17] who showed that this nucleus projects to anterior and ventral parts of the brain in nonprimates, however, Rose and Woolsey termed this projection zone \"orbitofrontal.\" It seems to have been Akert, who, for the first time in 1964, explicitly suggested that this criterion could be used to define homologues of the prefrontal cortex in primates and nonprimates.[18] This allowed the establishment of homologies despite the lack of a granular frontal cortex in nonprimates.\nThe projection zone definition is still widely accepted today (e.g. Fuster[19]), although its usefulness has been questioned.[14][20] Modern tract tracing studies have shown that projections of the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus are not restricted to the granular frontal cortex in primates. As a result, it was suggested to define the prefrontal cortex as the region of cortex that has stronger reciprocal connections with the mediodorsal nucleus than with any other thalamic nucleus.[15] Uylings et al.[15] acknowledge, however, that even with the application of this criterion, it might be rather difficult to define the prefrontal cortex unequivocally.\nA third definition of the prefrontal cortex is the area of frontal cortex whose electrical stimulation does not lead to observable movements. For example, in 1890, David Ferrier[21] used the term in this sense. One complication with this definition is that the electrically \"silent\" frontal cortex includes both granular and non-granular areas.[14]\nAccording to Striedter,[22] the PFC of humans can be delineated into two functionally, morphologically, and evolutionarily different regions: the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) consisting of:\nand the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), consisting of:\nThe LPFC contains the Brodmann areas BA8, BA9, BA10, BA45, BA46, and BA47. Some researchers also include BA44. The vmPFC contains the Brodmann areas BA12, BA25, BA32, BA33, BA24, BA11, BA13, and BA14.\nThe table below shows different ways to subdivide parts of the human prefrontal cortex based upon Brodmann areas.[1]\nThe prefrontal cortex is highly interconnected with much of the brain, including extensive connections with other cortical, subcortical and brain stem sites.[25] The dorsal prefrontal cortex is especially interconnected with brain regions involved with attention, cognition and action,[26] while the ventral prefrontal cortex interconnects with brain regions involved with emotion.[27] The prefrontal cortex also receives inputs from the brainstem arousal systems, and its function is particularly dependent on its neurochemical environment.[28] Thus, there is coordination between one's state of arousal and mental state.[29] The interplay between the prefrontal cortex and socioemotional system \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Check out these exercises now!\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nIt is widely accepted that physical exercise can be used as a tool for the prevention and treatment of various diseases or disorders. In addition, in the recent years, exercise has also been successfully used to enhance people's cognition. There is a large amount of research that has supported the benefits of physical exercise on human cognition, both in children and adults. Among these studies, some have focused on the acute or transitory effects of exercise on cognition, while others have focused on the effects of regular physical exercise. However, the relation between exercise and cognition is complex and we still have limited knowledge about the moderators and mechanisms underlying this relation. Most of human studies have focused on the behavioral aspects of exercise-effects on cognition, while animal studies have deepened in its possible neuro-physiological mechanisms. Even so, thanks to advances in neuroimaging techniques, there is a growing body of evidence that provides valuable information regarding these mechanisms in the human population. This review aims to analyze the effects of regular and acute aerobic exercise on cognition. The exercise-cognition relationship will be reviewed both from the behavioral perspective and from the neurophysiological mechanisms. The effects of exercise on animals, adult humans, and infant humans will be analyzed separately. Finally, physical exercise intervention programs aiming to increase cognitive performance in scholar and workplace environments will be reviewed.\nKeywords: physical activity, cognition, learning, animals, young adults, children, brain, neuro-physiological mechanisms, school exercise-intervention, workplace exercise-intervention\nNew scientific evidence is added daily to justify the prescription or recommendation of regular physical activity practice. Physical exercise has been shown to be a primary tool in the prevention and treatment of diseases or disorders of very diverse origin such as obesity [1], colon or breast cancer [2], Parkinson disease [3],[4], developmental coordination disorder [5],[6], attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [7],[8], learning impairment [9], or in a multitude of psychological problems, such as depression and anxiety [10].\nBeyond its function as an instrument for the prevention or treatment of disorders and pathologies, physical activity, and especially aerobic exercise, has been attributed the property of positively influencing cognitive performance [11]\u2013[14]. Cognition or cognitive function can be defined as a set of mental abilities that can be grouped into areas or dimensions, among which we highlight executive function (including inhibition, cognitive flexibility, planning and execution, and updating short-term memory), attention and memory, as they are closely related to learning capacity [15]\u2013[18]. In this way, the practice of physical exercise could be a tool for the stimulation of cognitive function and learning capacity [16],[19],[20], either from regular exercise (long-term exercise or training) or from participation in a single session of physical exercise (acute exercise).\nTo understand how aerobic exercise affects cognitive function, researchers have not only studies changes in behavior but have also focused on the biological mechanisms that underpin these changes. Thanks to advances in neuroimaging techniques, there is a growing volume of scientific evidence that allows determining the anatomical and functional changes that occur in different brain areas and the magnitude of the benefits that exercise can induce related to cognitive function [3],[21],[22]. Greater difficulties exist when trying to investigate the physiological effects of exercise on the human brain due to the high degree of invasiveness that data collection techniques would entail. For this reason, the direct observation of exercise effects on brain's physiology is usually approached with animal studies [23], while indirect evaluation in humans is usually approached through analysis of blood biomarkers [24].\nKnowledge of the benefits of physical exercise and the neuro-physiological mechanisms involved could provide a greater scientific basis for the development of intervention plans based on increasing regular aerobic physical exercise to enhance cognitive performance and even academic and professional performance. In addition, the findings derived from acute exercise interventions may be especially important for their specific use in populations that are in their formative stages or in situations where the improvement of cognitive function would especially benefit their learning capacity, for example, in elementary schools, middle or high schools, or even university level.\nThus, below, some of the latest advances in the study of the effects of aerobic physical exercise on cognitive function (especially the effects on these dimensions of cognitive function most associated with learning capacity) and learning capacity will be reviewed in child and youth (6\u201317 years) and young adult (18\u201335 years) ages. The results obtained from studies with long-term interventions (training) will be differentiated from those obtained from participation in a single session of physical exercise (acute exercise). Likewise, knowing the existing difficulties in studying the physiological effects of exercise on the human brain, we will also rely on studies carried out in animals to expose the biological factors involved in the exercise-cognitive capacity association. Finally, after analyzing the state of the question, we will present some successful intervention studies aimed at improving cognitive function and learning capacity in young adult populations and children in specific contexts (i.e., current work and academic, respectively).\nStudies of the effect of regular exercise on cognitive function carried out in animals have made it possible to observe directly (from their dis\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",
