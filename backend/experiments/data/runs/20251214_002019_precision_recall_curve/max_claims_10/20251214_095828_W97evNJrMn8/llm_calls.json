    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nthe Labour party has won this general election and that's it 14 years of conservative rule has this morning come to a rather brutal end after a relatively short but terribly bruising campaign the conservatives have been reduced to their lowest seat share ever with them dropping below the 156 seats that they won in the 1906 general election on the other side of things though laor have achieved almost the highest seat share in their history getting very close to the huge 400 18 seats that they won in the 1997 general election it's not only labor who've had a good night though the liberal Democrats have also had a very good night with their seat share ticking up to a huge 71 seats the highest seat share ever and up from only 11 in 2019 this is in fact even higher than their seat share in 2010 when they agreed to a formal Coalition with the conservative party similarly it seems that reform UK have had a pretty good night too they've gone from no seats to a pretty respectable four seats even more impressively it seems they've achieved an even more respectable 14.3% of the vote the greens didn't have a terrible night either with them not only holding on to Brighton Pavilion but also gaining Bristol Central waveny Valley and North herfordshire the only other party that had a pretty bad night was the SNP who were damaged by their ongoing scandals and their very recent change of leader despite their electoral dominance in Scotland over the last decade or so last night they received their lowest seat share since 2010 winning only nine seats this is a significant decline since 2019 when they won 48 out of the 56 available in Scotland obviously this will raise a couple of key questions the first is whether this is the beginning of the end of S&P dominance in Scotland and secondly is what such a terrible result will mean for the cause of Scottish independence so anyway these are the headline results from the election but let's dive a little deeper and have a look at what [Music] happened before we start if you haven't already please consider subscribing and ringing the bell to stay in the loop and be notified when we release new videos now the key event from last night occurred at 10 p.m. when we got our first indication of what was to come in the release of the exit Pole now the most shocking thing to note in the exit poll here was the number of expected reform seats the exit pole predicted that reform would get 13 seats significantly higher than most of the MRP polls in the run up to the election however there were some wobbles through the night with some polls suggesting that the exit pole had overestimated the number of seats the more observant of you will notice that it turns out that the exit pole had indeed overestimated and in the end reform achieved only four seats the other shocking find from the exit pole was the number of predicted Tory seats prior to election day many of the MRP polls were predicting below 100 Tory seats while the exit poll predicted icted that the Tories were going to win 131 seats What followed was deeply chaotic and something that made writing this video through the night even more difficult as the results started coming in it appeared that the exit pole was slightly wrong although the BBC and ITV couldn't quite agree in what direction in the we hours of Friday morning the BBC updated their prediction with them suggesting that the conservatives were going to win more seats while ITV updated theirs and predicted that they would in fact win fewer as things stand it appears that the Tories have won slightly fewer than originally predicted but not significantly anyway overall results aside the night was also particularly interesting when it came to individuals there were two properly shocking and unexpected results the first was Jonathan Ashworth unexpectedly losing his seat to an independent candidate Ashworth has previously been the shadow Health secretary and up until today was the shadow pay Master General it appears that the loss of his seat has been a result of labor stance on Gaza something that could cause problems from the incoming labor government more generally the second unexpected result was Jeremy Corbin's election in Islington North having been deselected as a labor MP Corbin opted to stand in his constituency as an independent he did however make the decision to stand rather late in the election cycle something that led to a decent proportion of journalists and pundits to believe that he was going to lose the constituency to the new labor candidate this wasn't the case though and Corbin secured himself a pretty decent majority so now that we've gone through exactly what happened through the night it's worth going through what this all means for the main parties now the most interesting party to discuss right now are the conservatives who as we've just discussed lost some pretty major figures through the night at the time of writing sunak has not yet announced his resignation as conservative leader although he is expected to either this morning or in the coming days and weeks this will naturally Kickstart a leadership election the question now is who would take over while it's a little too soon to tell there are some candidates that were in a particularly strong position right now KY Bok is in the strongest position she's got a rather strong following among right-wing Tories both in Parliament and among the membership what really bolsters this position is the fact that one of her key Rivals for the leadership Penny Morant lost her seat last night is worth mentioning though that there has been an issue in bok's constituency with postal votes and if this is challenging the courts it could cause problems for her candidacy in the Tory leadership election anyway someone else that there's some chatter about in terms of taking over the Tory leadership is Nigel farage and his potential defection from reform UK in order to lead the Tories after all he now has a seat in the House of Commons and there are some relatively senior members of the conservative party who have gone on the record as saying that they would like farage to join their party only the next few weeks will show exactly what happens here but if you do want to stay informed on this make sure you subscribe to the channel anyway what happens next for labor is quite simple the new prime minister K sta will meet the king and agree to form a government in his name he'll take office at Downing Street assemble his first cabinet and could even represent his party in a pmq session before the imminent summer recess they will soon begin implementing their policy platform as outlined in their Manifesto whether they're successful at implementing this is not yet known though and something we'll need to keep an eye on through the next few years of lab government regardless this is clearly a Monumental election for labor and the UK and when these kinds of Elections happen people tend to like to save newspapers and magazines with the headlines for posterity the

Nominations closed on 24 February 2023 with three candidates: Kate Forbes, Ash Regan, and Humza Yousaf being presented to the electorate of party members. Yousaf was elected the new leader on 27 March with 48.2% of first preference votes and 52.1% of the vote after third-placed candidate Regan's second preferences were redistributed. Yousaf was elected as the First Minister of Scotland on 28 March 2023.\nThis was the first contested leadership election in the SNP in nearly twenty years as Sturgeon was elected unopposed in the previous election held in 2014. During the course of the election, both the party's chief executive, Peter Murrell (also Sturgeon's husband), and MSP group media chief, Murray Foote, resigned from their positions on 18 and 17 March, respectively, over inaccurate party's membership numbers being communicated.[1]\nIn 2004, Alex Salmond became leader of the SNP, having previously led the party from 1990 to 2000. In the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, the SNP won a plurality of votes and seats and Salmond became the first minister of Scotland. In the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, the SNP won a majority of seats on a platform of delivering a referendum on Scottish independence. This referendum took place in 2014, with the question \"should Scotland become an independent country?\". A majority of voters, 55.3%, answered \"no\", and Salmond resigned as leader and first minister.[2] His deputy first minister since 2007 and depute leader of the SNP since 2004, Nicola Sturgeon, was elected unopposed as his successor.[3]\nSturgeon led the SNP in the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, forming a minority government. She again led the party into the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, which led to a power-sharing agreement with the Scottish Greens. Over the same period, the party won a majority of seats in each of the 2015, 2017, and 2019 general elections, winning all but three seats in Scotland in the 2015 election. Sturgeon's government advocated for another Scottish independence referendum, but in 2022 the UK Supreme Court ruled they did not have the legal standing to hold one without agreement from Westminster.[4][5][6] On 25 May 2022, she became the longest-serving first minister of Scotland since the role was established in 1999, surpassing the record held by Salmond.[7]\nOn 15 February 2023, Sturgeon announced her intention to stand down as the leader of the SNP and first minister, saying that she would remain in office until a new leader was elected.[8][9] Sturgeon insisted that her resignation was not due to \"short term pressures\" but said that the job \"takes its toll on you.\"[10] She said she would remain in office as a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) until the next Scottish Parliament election, expected to be held in 2026.[11] On 2 March, John Swinney, the Deputy First Minister, and only person other than Sturgeon to be in Cabinet since the SNP came to power in 2007, also announced that after 16 years he planned to leave Government following the contest.[12] Sturgeon's husband, Peter Murrell, initially remained the SNP's chief executive, although there were calls for him to resign.[13][14][15] However, he would subsequently resign on 18 March.[1]\nSturgeon said that the timing of her decision was determined by an impending special SNP conference to decide the party's strategy on independence, which had been due to take place on 19 March 2023. Her proposal for the event was that the next general or Scottish Parliament election should be treated as a de facto referendum on independence.[16] This plan was controversial within the party.[17] Among others, the leader of the SNP in the House of Commons, Stephen Flynn, called for the conference to be postponed following Sturgeon's resignation.[18][19] The party's national executive committee decided on 16 February 2023 to postpone it.[20]\nSturgeon's resignation came following years during which the party's reputation for discipline had been frayed, two years after the conclusion of an inquiry into the handling of complaints of sexual harassment against her predecessor, of which he was acquitted in court in 2020, after which inquiry Salmond launched the electorally unsuccessful splinter Alba Party. It came during an ongoing dispute over the Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill and an ongoing fraud investigation into the SNP.[21][22] It followed two months after a change in leadership at the SNP Westminster group, after Ian Blackford, seen as an ally of Sturgeon, denied being forced out by other MPs,[23] where Alison Thewliss, also seen as an ally of Sturgeon,[24] was defeated.\nThe Scottish Greens stated they would decide whether to continue the power-sharing agreement with the SNP after the new leader was chosen.[25]\nThere were three main issues in the leadership campaign: economics, Scottish independence, and gender recognition reform.[26]\nBefore the leadership election, the SNP government in Scotland and their coalition partners in the Scottish Green Party were criticised by critics on the right of being \"anti-growth\" with a rejection of new drilling for oil and gas, a bottle recycling scheme, and curbs on advertising alcohol. Meanwhile, critics on the left have accused the government of adopting neoliberal economic policies, selling off green energy resources, and supporting free ports.[26]\nForbes was seen as being the most friendly candidate for business. The power-sharing agreement with the Greens was seen to be under threat from either Forbes or Regan winning. All three candidates expressed concerns over the bottle recycling scheme.[26]\nThe SNP's strategy for achieving Scottish independence, the central goal of the party, was expected to be one of the main issue\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The opposition Labour Party, led by Keir Starmer, won a landslide victory over the governing Conservative Party under Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, ending 14 years of Conservative government.[3]\nLabour secured 411 seats[f][b] and a 174-seat majority, the third-best showing in the party's history and its best since 2001. The party's vote share was 33.7%, the lowest of any governing party on record, making this the least proportional general election in British history.[4] They became the largest party in England, Scotland and Wales. The Conservatives suffered their worst-ever defeat, winning 121 seats with 23.7% of the vote and losing 251 seats, including those of the former prime minister Liz Truss and 12 Cabinet ministers.[5]\nSmaller parties saw record support, with 42.6% of the total vote. The Liberal Democrats, led by Ed Davey, became the third-largest party with 72 seats, their best result ever and better than any Liberal Party result since 1923. Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, won five seats and 14.3% of the vote, the third-highest vote share, and the Green Party won four seats. For both parties this was their best parliamentary result to date.\nIn Scotland the Scottish National Party dropped from 48 to 9 seats, losing its status as Scotland's largest party.[6] In Wales, Plaid Cymru won four seats. In Northern Ireland, which has a distinct set of political parties,[7] Sinn F\u00e9in retained seven seats; the first election in which an Irish nationalist party won the most seats in Northern Ireland. The Democratic Unionist Party dropped from 8 to 5 seats.\nCampaign issues included the economy, healthcare, housing, energy and immigration. There was relatively little discussion of Brexit, which was a major issue during the 2019 general election. This was the first general election under the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act 2022, the first with photo identification required to vote in Great Britain,[g] and the first fought using the new constituency boundaries implemented following the 2023 review of Westminster constituencies.[8]\nThe Conservative Party under Boris Johnson won a large majority at the 2019 general election and the new government passed the Brexit withdrawal agreement.[9][10] The COVID-19 pandemic saw the government institute extensive public health restrictions, including limitations on social interaction, that Johnson and some of his staff were later found to have broken. The resulting political scandal (Partygate), one of many controversies during Johnson's premiership, saw the Conservatives lose their poll lead.[11][12] These scandals culminated in the resignation of over 50 ministers from the Government following allegations of sexual misconduct against a government minister. Johnson resigned as prime minister in July 2022.[13] He resigned as an MP the following year,[14] after an investigation unanimously found that he had lied to Parliament.[15]\nLiz Truss won the resultant leadership election and succeeded Johnson in September.[16][17] Truss announced large-scale tax cuts and borrowing in a mini-budget on 23 September, although many of its measures were reversed following financial instability.[18] She resigned in October, making her the shortest-serving prime minister in British history,[19] and was succeeded unopposed by Rishi Sunak.[20]\nDuring his premiership, Sunak was credited with improving the economy and stabilising national politics following the premierships of his predecessors,[21] although many of his pledges and policy announcements ultimately went unfulfilled.[22][23] He did not avert further unpopularity for the Conservatives who, by the time of Sunak's election, had been in government for 12 years. Public opinion in favour of a change in government was reflected in the Conservatives' poor performance at the 2022, 2023 and 2024 local elections.[24]\nKeir Starmer won the Labour Party's 2020 leadership election, succeeding Jeremy Corbyn.[25] Under his leadership, Starmer repositioned the party away from the left and toward the political centre, and emphasised the elimination of antisemitism within the party.[26][27] Starmer's leading his party rightward in order to improve its electability has been widely compared to Tony Blair's development of New Labour in the 1990s. The political turmoil from the Conservative scandals and government crises led to Labour having a significant lead in polling over the Conservatives, often by very wide margins, since late 2021, coinciding with the start of the Partygate scandal.[11][12] Labour made gains in local elections: in the 2023 local elections, Labour gained more than 500 councillors and 22 councils, becoming the largest party in local government for the first time since 2002.[28]\nEd Davey, who previously served in the Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition, won the Liberal Democrats' 2020 leadership election, succeeding Jo Swinson, who lost her seat in the previous general election.[29] Davey prioritised defeating the Conservatives and ruled out working with them following the election.[30] The Liberal Democrats made gains in local elections: in the 2024 local elections, the Liberal Democrats finished second for the first time in a local election cycle since 2009.[31]\nLike the Conservatives, the Scottish National Party (SNP) suffered political turmoil and saw a decrease in their popularity in opinion polling, with multiple party leaders and First Ministers (Nicola Sturgeon, Humza Yousaf and John Swinney) and the Operation Branchform police investigation. Sturgeon claimed occupational burnout was the reason for her resignation,[32] while Yousaf resigned amid a government crisis following his termination of a power-sharing agreement with the Scottish Greens.[33] When Swinney assumed the leadership after being elected unopposed to succeed Yousaf, the SNP had been \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Labour was the big winner on the night.\n\nFull Page Content:\nNicola Sturgeon\nHumza Yousaf\nThe 2023 Scottish National Party leadership election took place in February and March 2023 to choose the leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP) to succeed Nicola Sturgeon, who announced her resignation on 15 February. Nominations closed on 24 February 2023 with three candidates: Kate Forbes, Ash Regan, and Humza Yousaf being presented to the electorate of party members. Yousaf was elected the new leader on 27 March with 48.2% of first preference votes and 52.1% of the vote after third-placed candidate Regan's second preferences were redistributed. Yousaf was elected as the First Minister of Scotland on 28 March 2023.\nThis was the first contested leadership election in the SNP in nearly twenty years as Sturgeon was elected unopposed in the previous election held in 2014. During the course of the election, both the party's chief executive, Peter Murrell (also Sturgeon's husband), and MSP group media chief, Murray Foote, resigned from their positions on 18 and 17 March, respectively, over inaccurate party's membership numbers being communicated.[1]\nIn 2004, Alex Salmond became leader of the SNP, having previously led the party from 1990 to 2000. In the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, the SNP won a plurality of votes and seats and Salmond became the first minister of Scotland. In the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, the SNP won a majority of seats on a platform of delivering a referendum on Scottish independence. This referendum took place in 2014, with the question \"should Scotland become an independent country?\". A majority of voters, 55.3%, answered \"no\", and Salmond resigned as leader and first minister.[2] His deputy first minister since 2007 and depute leader of the SNP since 2004, Nicola Sturgeon, was elected unopposed as his successor.[3]\nSturgeon led the SNP in the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, forming a minority government. She again led the party into the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, which led to a power-sharing agreement with the Scottish Greens. Over the same period, the party won a majority of seats in each of the 2015, 2017, and 2019 general elections, winning all but three seats in Scotland in the 2015 election. Sturgeon's government advocated for another Scottish independence referendum, but in 2022 the UK Supreme Court ruled they did not have the legal standing to hold one without agreement from Westminster.[4][5][6] On 25 May 2022, she became the longest-serving first minister of Scotland since the role was established in 1999, surpassing the record held by Salmond.[7]\nOn 15 February 2023, Sturgeon announced her intention to stand down as the leader of the SNP and first minister, saying that she would remain in office until a new leader was elected.[8][9] Sturgeon insisted that her resignation was not due to \"short term pressures\" but said that the job \"takes its toll on you.\"[10] She said she would remain in office as a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) until the next Scottish Parliament election, expected to be held in 2026.[11] On 2 March, John Swinney, the Deputy First Minister, and only person other than Sturgeon to be in Cabinet since the SNP came to power in 2007, also announced that after 16 years he planned to leave Government following the contest.[12] Sturgeon's husband, Peter Murrell, initially remained the SNP's chief executive, although there were calls for him to resign.[13][14][15] However, he would subsequently resign on 18 March.[1]\nSturgeon said that the timing of her decision was determined by an impending special SNP conference to decide the party's strategy on independence, which had been due to take place on 19 March 2023. Her proposal for the event was that the next general or Scottish Parliament election should be treated as a de facto referendum on independence.[16] This plan was controversial within the party.[17] Among others, the leader of the SNP in the House of Commons, Stephen Flynn, called for the conference to be postponed following Sturgeon's resignation.[18][19] The party's national executive committee decided on 16 February 2023 to postpone it.[20]\nSturgeon's resignation came following years during which the party's reputation for discipline had been frayed, two years after the conclusion of an inquiry into the handling of complaints of sexual harassment against her predecessor, of which he was acquitted in court in 2020, after which inquiry Salmond launched the electorally unsuccessful splinter Alba Party. It came during an ongoing dispute over the Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill and an ongoing fraud investigation into the SNP.[21][22] It followed two months after a change in leadership at the SNP Westminster group, after Ian Blackford, seen as an ally of Sturgeon, denied being forced out by other MPs,[23] where Alison Thewliss, also seen as an ally of Sturgeon,[24] was defeated.\nThe Scottish Greens stated they would decide whether to continue the power-sharing agreement with the SNP after the new leader was chosen.[25]\nThere were three main issues in the leadership campaign: economics, Scottish independence, and gender recognition reform.[26]\nBefore the leadership election, the SNP government in Scotland and their coalition partners in the Scottish Green Party were criticised by critics on the right of being \"anti-growth\" with a rejection of new drilling for oil and gas, a bottle recycling scheme, and curbs on advertising alcohol. Meanwhile, critics on the left have accused the government of adopting neoliberal economic policies, selling off green energy resources, and supporting free ports.[26]\nForbes was seen as being the most friendly candidate for business. The power-sharing agreement with the Greens was seen to be under threat from either Forbes or Regan winning. All three candidates expressed concerns over the bottle recycling scheme.[26]\nThe SNP's strategy for achieving Scottish independence, the central goal of the party, was expected to be one of the main issue\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The political turmoil from the Conservative scandals and government crises led to Labour having a significant lead in polling over the Conservatives, often by very wide margins, since late 2021, coinciding with the start of the Partygate scandal.[11][12] Labour made gains in local elections: in the 2023 local elections, Labour gained more than 500 councillors and 22 councils, becoming the largest party in local government for the first time since 2002.[28]\nEd Davey, who previously served in the Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition, won the Liberal Democrats' 2020 leadership election, succeeding Jo Swinson, who lost her seat in the previous general election.[29] Davey prioritised defeating the Conservatives and ruled out working with them following the election.[30] The Liberal Democrats made gains in local elections: in the 2024 local elections, the Liberal Democrats finished second for the first time in a local election cycle since 2009.[31]\nLike the Conservatives, the Scottish National Party (SNP) suffered political turmoil and saw a decrease in their popularity in opinion polling, with multiple party leaders and First Ministers (Nicola Sturgeon, Humza Yousaf and John Swinney) and the Operation Branchform police investigation. Sturgeon claimed occupational burnout was the reason for her resignation,[32] while Yousaf resigned amid a government crisis following his termination of a power-sharing agreement with the Scottish Greens.[33] When Swinney assumed the leadership after being elected unopposed to succeed Yousaf, the SNP had been \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Nominations closed on 24 February 2023 with three candidates: Kate Forbes, Ash Regan, and Humza Yousaf being presented to the electorate of party members. Yousaf was elected the new leader on 27 March with 48.2% of first preference votes and 52.1% of the vote after third-placed candidate Regan's second preferences were redistributed. Yousaf was elected as the First Minister of Scotland on 28 March 2023.\nThis was the first contested leadership election in the SNP in nearly twenty years as Sturgeon was elected unopposed in the previous election held in 2014. During the course of the election, both the party's chief executive, Peter Murrell (also Sturgeon's husband), and MSP group media chief, Murray Foote, resigned from their positions on 18 and 17 March, respectively, over inaccurate party's membership numbers being communicated.[1]\nIn 2004, Alex Salmond became leader of the SNP, having previously led the party from 1990 to 2000. In the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, the SNP won a plurality of votes and seats and Salmond became the first minister of Scotland. In the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, the SNP won a majority of seats on a platform of delivering a referendum on Scottish independence. This referendum took place in 2014, with the question \"should Scotland become an independent country?\". A majority of voters, 55.3%, answered \"no\", and Salmond resigned as leader and first minister.[2] His deputy first minister since 2007 and depute leader of the SNP since 2004, Nicola Sturgeon, was elected unopposed as his successor.[3]\nSturgeon led the SNP in the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, forming a minority government. She again led the party into the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, which led to a power-sharing agreement with the Scottish Greens. Over the same period, the party won a majority of seats in each of the 2015, 2017, and 2019 general elections, winning all but three seats in Scotland in the 2015 election. Sturgeon's government advocated for another Scottish independence referendum, but in 2022 the UK Supreme Court ruled they did not have the legal standing to hold one without agreement from Westminster.[4][5][6] On 25 May 2022, she became the longest-serving first minister of Scotland since the role was established in 1999, surpassing the record held by Salmond.[7]\nOn 15 February 2023, Sturgeon announced her intention to stand down as the leader of the SNP and first minister, saying that she would remain in office until a new leader was elected.[8][9] Sturgeon insisted that her resignation was not due to \"short term pressures\" but said that the job \"takes its toll on you.\"[10] She said she would remain in office as a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) until the next Scottish Parliament election, expected to be held in 2026.[11] On 2 March, John Swinney, the Deputy First Minister, and only person other than Sturgeon to be in Cabinet since the SNP came to power in 2007, also announced that after 16 years he planned to leave Government following the contest.[12] Sturgeon's husband, Peter Murrell, initially remained the SNP's chief executive, although there were calls for him to resign.[13][14][15] However, he would subsequently resign on 18 March.[1]\nSturgeon said that the timing of her decision was determined by an impending special SNP conference to decide the party's strategy on independence, which had been due to take place on 19 March 2023. Her proposal for the event was that the next general or Scottish Parliament election should be treated as a de facto referendum on independence.[16] This plan was controversial within the party.[17] Among others, the leader of the SNP in the House of Commons, Stephen Flynn, called for the conference to be postponed following Sturgeon's resignation.[18][19] The party's national executive committee decided on 16 February 2023 to postpone it.[20]\nSturgeon's resignation came following years during which the party's reputation for discipline had been frayed, two years after the conclusion of an inquiry into the handling of complaints of sexual harassment against her predecessor, of which he was acquitted in court in 2020, after which inquiry Salmond launched the electorally unsuccessful splinter Alba Party. It came during an ongoing dispute over the Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill and an ongoing fraud investigation into the SNP.[21][22] It followed two months after a change in leadership at the SNP Westminster group, after Ian Blackford, seen as an ally of Sturgeon, denied being forced out by other MPs,[23] where Alison Thewliss, also seen as an ally of Sturgeon,[24] was defeated.\nThe Scottish Greens stated they would decide whether to continue the power-sharing agreement with the SNP after the new leader was chosen.[25]\nThere were three main issues in the leadership campaign: economics, Scottish independence, and gender recognition reform.[26]\nBefore the leadership election, the SNP government in Scotland and their coalition partners in the Scottish Green Party were criticised by critics on the right of being \"anti-growth\" with a rejection of new drilling for oil and gas, a bottle recycling scheme, and curbs on advertising alcohol. Meanwhile, critics on the left have accused the government of adopting neoliberal economic policies, selling off green energy resources, and supporting free ports.[26]\nForbes was seen as being the most friendly candidate for business. The power-sharing agreement with the Greens was seen to be under threat from either Forbes or Regan winning. All three candidates expressed concerns over the bottle recycling scheme.[26]\nThe SNP's strategy for achieving Scottish independence, the central goal of the party, was expected to be one of the main issue\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Anderson\u2019s old party was beaten into fourth place by an independent candidate.\nReform was projected to win as many as 13 seats in the general election, according to the 10pm exit poll. Declarations in north-east England showed it outpolling the Conservatives to come second to Labour.\nThe projection also indicated that Farage, who returned as leader of the party last month, was set to win the Essex seat of Clacton.\nFarage used a video posted on X to deliver his first response to the exit poll, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s midnight, there are two results in from the north-east of England that put Reform on 30% of the vote; that is way more than any possible prediction or projection. It is almost unbelievable.\n\u201cAnd what does it mean? It means we\u2019re going to win seats, many many seats, I think, right now, across the country. But to watch the TV coverage, it\u2019s almost comical.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a single representative on there from Reform UK. Mainstream media are in denial just as much as our political parties. This is going to be 6 million votes-plus. This, folks, is huge.\u201d\nWhile there was caution about how the poll of 20,000 would ultimately translate into seats, it was clear that millions of people had voted for the hard-right, anti-immigration party, which has previously indicated its intent to destroy the Conservative party.\nBen Habib, Reform\u2019s deputy leader, was the first of the party\u2019s senior figures to seize on the BBC/ITV/Sky survey projection. He tweeted: \u201cThis is a huge bridgehead. This is politically seismic. This is the beginning of the fightback for the nation state of the United Kingdom.\u201d\nEarly declarations underlined the surge in support for the party in what had been strong Brexit-supporting areas of north-east England, where Reform outpolled the Tories in a number of seats.\nWhile Farage has always kept his cards close to his chest about how many seats he expected to win, the projected seat share is believed to be much higher than what he could have hoped for.\nFarage\u2019s agent, Peter Harris, told the Guardian that it was early days but the party appeared to be in a strong position. \u201cWe could see that there was a strong turnout. In places like Jaywick, the queues were long, and had people in there who had not voted before or had given up on voting until now,\u201d he said.\nThe expected vote share opened up the possibility of the electorate returning Reform MPs in target seats from Essex, the Kent Coast, south Wales and Yorkshire and the Humber.\nRichard Tice, Reform\u2019s chair and the man who stepped aside so that Farage could return, appeared to be in a strong position to win in the Lincolnshire constituency of Boston and Skegness, which has been represented by Tory Matt Warman since 2015.\nOthers who were in a strong position included the former Southampton Football Club chair, Rupert Lowe, who was running in Great Yarmouth, which has been held by the Conservatives since 2010.\nMargaret Hodge, the former Labour minister, likened the challenge of Reform to that posed by the British National party, which she faced down during a battle for her Barking seat in 2010. She told the BBC: \u201cIt\u2019s where they put their vote if they don\u2019t have trust.\u201d\nA note of caution was sounded by Prof Sir John Curtice, the psephologist and lead election analyst for the BBC, who said that the projected seat shares for Reform UK and the SNP were the two figures about which he and others were least certain.\nMore from the Guardian\nAnalysis: Anatomy of an earthquake: 2024 election delivers savage verdict\nOpinion: \u2018This exit poll portends total rejection of these amoral Tories \u2013 and incredible vindication for Labour\u2019\nAnalysis: Labour hardly dared to believe.

It is based on the definitive results which are published in Britain ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nSTUDY NOTES\nLast updated 20 Nov 2017\nLet's look in this study note at some key aspects of social class and partisanship as they relate to the 1997 General Election.\nClass dealignment\nIn the early 1990s, a standard politics essay title was \u201cmust Labour lose?\u201d and the reason for the question was not just the four election defeats from 1979 to 1992, but the idea that the UK had changed in such a way that Labour no longer had a core vote large enough to sustain an election victory. The idea was that because of embourgeoisement (people becoming more middle class) and the decline in traditional manufacturing industries and trade union membership, there was not a traditional working class big enough to bring the Labour Party an election victory. Some of Labour\u2019s vote had always come from middle-class individuals, particularly those working in education and the public sector, but it was never a big enough constituency to give Labour a victory without a strong showing from the traditional working class.\nA section of Labour\u2019s traditional vote moved to the Conservatives in the late 1970s and 1980s, attracted by Thatcherism. Again, some working-class people had always voted Conservative, but this section of the party\u2019s support base had grown significantly over issues like being able to purchase their own council house (which Labour opposed).\nMondeo Man\nMondeo Man was Tony Blair\u2019s idea of the sort of person who had to switch from Conservative to Labour in order for Labour to win in 1997. He was in his 30s, married, owned his home (semi-detached), lived in the South East and drove a Ford Mondeo. He was also, critically, \u201caspirational\u201d. He saw himself socially advancing in the years to come and was interested in political policies that would help that and reward that, rather than those that sought to redistribute money from the wealthy to the poorest.\nIn the 1980s and 1990s \u201cEssex Man\u201d had been presented as the bedrock of support for Margaret Thatcher and John Major: someone from a working-class background who had profited from Thatcherite politics and now had some money and aspired to make more. Mondeo Man was a similar character. Psephologists also talk about C1s \u2013 the aspirational lower middle class. These were identified as swing voters (and also often lived in marginal seats) and New Labour targeted them pretty ruthlessly and effectively.\nAlthough voting in elections is a secret ballot there are a few ways in which we can get quite an accurate picture of how people actually voted in the 1997 election. One is because of the social demographic of different constituencies: if a party does particularly well in a constituency that is predominantly middle-class, for instance, that can give some indication. More detailed data comes from exit polls where a representative sample were asked about how they voted on leaving the polling station.\nExit poll data for 1997 shows:\n3rd June 2024\n10th January 2024\n16th October 2023\n29th June 2023\n15th May 2023\n20th March 2023\n29th September 2022\n24th May 2022\nSubscribe to our email updates and we'll let you know whenever new blog posts are published.\n\u00a9 2025 Tutor2u Limited.

The idea was that because of embourgeoisement (people becoming more middle class) and the decline in traditional manufacturing industries and trade union membership, there was not a traditional working class big enough to bring the Labour Party an election victory. Some of Labour\u2019s vote had always come from middle-class individuals, particularly those working in education and the public sector, but it was never a big enough constituency to give Labour a victory without a strong showing from the traditional working class.\nA section of Labour\u2019s traditional vote moved to the Conservatives in the late 1970s and 1980s, attracted by Thatcherism. Again, some working-class people had always voted Conservative, but this section of the party\u2019s support base had grown significantly over issues like being able to purchase their own council house (which Labour opposed).\nMondeo Man\nMondeo Man was Tony Blair\u2019s idea of the sort of person who had to switch from Conservative to Labour in order for Labour to win in 1997. He was in his 30s, married, owned his home (semi-detached), lived in the South East and drove a Ford Mondeo. He was also, critically, \u201caspirational\u201d. He saw himself socially advancing in the years to come and was interested in political policies that would help that and reward that, rather than those that sought to redistribute money from the wealthy to the poorest.\nIn the 1980s and 1990s \u201cEssex Man\u201d had been presented as the bedrock of support for Margaret Thatcher and John Major: someone from a working-class background who had profited from Thatcherite politics and now had some money and aspired to make more. Mondeo Man was a similar character. Psephologists also talk about C1s \u2013 the aspirational lower middle class. These were identified as swing voters (and also often lived in marginal seats) and New Labour targeted them pretty ruthlessly and effectively.\nAlthough voting in elections is a secret ballot there are a few ways in which we can get quite an accurate picture of how people actually voted in the 1997 election. One is because of the social demographic of different constituencies: if a party does particularly well in a constituency that is predominantly middle-class, for instance, that can give some indication. More detailed data comes from exit polls where a representative sample were asked about how they voted on leaving the polling station.\nExit poll data for 1997 shows:\n3rd June 2024\n10th January 2024\n16th October 2023\n29th June 2023\n15th May 2023\n20th March 2023\n29th September 2022\n24th May 2022\nSubscribe to our email updates and we'll let you know whenever new blog posts are published.\n\u00a9 2025 Tutor2u Limited.

Formed in 1900, it is one of the two main political parties along with the Conservative Party.

Since the 2010 general election, Labour was the second largest party in the UK for 14 years until the 2024 United Kingdom General election. Since 1918, Labour have formed 13 governments.\nThis article encompasses detailed results of previous UK general elections, devolved national elections in Scotland and Wales, devolved London elections and European Parliament elections which the Labour Party have participated in.\nThe Labour Party was founded at a conference in February 1900 in London as the Labour Representation Committee (LRC).[1] The party was formed as an alliance between trade unions, ethical socialists and state socialists.[1] Following the 1906 general election, the LRC became the current Labour Party.[2]\nLabour are one of the two main political parties in the United Kingdom, along with the Conservative Party. The Labour Party sits on the centre-left of the political spectrum.[8] In all general elections since 1918, Labour has been either the governing party or the Official Opposition.[9] There have been six Labour prime ministers.[7] Since 1918, Labour have formed 12 governments, compared to 13 for the Conservatives within this period.[10]\nThe voting system for general elections in the UK is the first past the post system.[11] The first general election the party faced, then the Labour Representation Committee, was only six months after the inauguration of the party.[12] Fifteen LRC candidates were put forward for the election, two of which were elected in 1900.[12] In 1903, the Secretary of the LRC Ramsay MacDonald and the Liberal Party's Chief Whip Herbert Gladstone formed a secret electoral pact between the two parties.[13] The party continued to grow over the following decade and by the December 1910 general election, Labour had 42 MPs.[14][15]\nFollowing the 1918 general election, Labour became the Official Opposition after the Conservatives went into coalition with the Liberal Party.[9] Labour's first minority governments came following the 1923 and 1929 general elections, the latter being the first time Labour were the largest party in parliament by seats won.[9] They formed their first majority government following the 1945 general election.[9] However, after winning the 1950 general election, Labour would lose the following election in 1951 to the Conservatives despite gaining their highest share of votes to date at 48.8%.[9] During the 1983 election, Labour posted their worst vote share in the post-war period at 27.6%.[9] In 1997, a party record of 418 Labour MPs were elected.[9] After losing power after the 2010 general election, Labour lost four consecutive general elections.[16][9] At the 2019 general election, 202 Labour MPs were elected, the lowest for the party since 1935.[9] At the 2024 general election, Labour returned to power after winning the election with a 174 seat majority.[17]\nFollowing a referendum on devolution in September 1997, the Scottish people voted 'Yes' leading to the Scotland Act 1998.[55][56] This act led to the formation of the Scottish Parliament in 1999.[57] After Scotland voted 'No' in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, additional powers were devolved to the Scottish Parliament after the Scotland Act 2016 reached royal assent.[56] Elections to determine the composition of the Parliament take place once every five years under the additional member system.[57] Overall, there are 73 constituency members (MSPs) and 56 regional members elected.[57] Before 2016, elections were held every four years.[57]\nIn the inaugural two elections, Labour were the largest party and formed a coalition with the Scottish Liberal Democrats on both occasions.[57] However, Labour narrowly lost the 2007 election to the Scottish National Party (SNP).[57] By seats won, Labour have been the third largest party in the Scottish Parliament behind the SNP and Conservatives since 2016.[57] In the most recent election in 2021, Labour suffered their worst defeat in Holyrood after returning 22 MSPs.[58]\nAs part of Labour's 1997 winning UK general election manifesto, Labour committed to devolving power to Wales and Scotland subject to public consent from referendums.[60] In July 1997, Labour released its white paper for devolution in Wales.[60] This devolution deal would include 60 elected members who would take responsibility for \u00a37 billion of funding.[60] Furthermore, this new Assembly would have the right to pass secondary legislation in order to modify already existing laws.[60] The devolution plans were endorsed by the public in the 1997 Welsh devolution referendum by 50.3% of the vote.[60] The Government of Wales Act 1998 would receive royal assent with the Assembly to be formed following the first election in May 1999.[60]\nIn 1999, the Welsh Assembly or Senedd Cymru was founded.[61] From 1999 until 2011, Welsh Assembly elections were held once every four years, they are now held every five years.[61] 40 Constituency Assembly Members (AMs) and 20 regional Assembly Members are elected at each election.[61] The current voting system is the additional member system.[61]\nAt every Senedd election, Labour has received the most votes and seats at each election, but has never formed a clear majority of seats.[61] Labour formed a coalition with the Welsh Liberal Democrats from 2000 to 2003.[61] From 2003 to 2007, Labour governed alone as a minority administration before serving in coalition with Plaid Cymru from 2007 to 2011.[61] Labour have governed alone as a minority administration since 2011.[61] Since 2021, Labour have had a formal cooperation agreement with Plaid Cymru to help pass budgets and to work together on several policy areas.[62]\nLondon Assembly elections are held every four years.[64] O\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The Labour Party sits on the centre-left of the political spectrum.[8] In all general elections since 1918, Labour has been either the governing party or the Official Opposition.[9] There have been six Labour prime ministers.[7] Since 1918, Labour have formed 12 governments, compared to 13 for the Conservatives within this period.[10]\nThe voting system for general elections in the UK is the first past the post system.[11] The first general election the party faced, then the Labour Representation Committee, was only six months after the inauguration of the party.[12] Fifteen LRC candidates were put forward for the election, two of which were elected in 1900.[12] In 1903, the Secretary of the LRC Ramsay MacDonald and the Liberal Party's Chief Whip Herbert Gladstone formed a secret electoral pact between the two parties.[13] The party continued to grow over the following decade and by the December 1910 general election, Labour had 42 MPs.[14][15]\nFollowing the 1918 general election, Labour became the Official Opposition after the Conservatives went into coalition with the Liberal Party.[9] Labour's first minority governments came following the 1923 and 1929 general elections, the latter being the first time Labour were the largest party in parliament by seats won.[9] They formed their first majority government following the 1945 general election.[9] However, after winning the 1950 general election, Labour would lose the following election in 1951 to the Conservatives despite gaining their highest share of votes to date at 48.8%.[9] During the 1983 election, Labour posted their worst vote share in the post-war period at 27.6%.[9] In 1997, a party record of 418 Labour MPs were elected.[9] After losing power after the 2010 general election, Labour lost four consecutive general elections.[16][9] At the 2019 general election, 202 Labour MPs were elected, the lowest for the party since 1935.[9] At the 2024 general election, Labour returned to power after winning the election with a 174 seat majority.[17]\nFollowing a referendum on devolution in September 1997, the Scottish people voted 'Yes' leading to the Scotland Act 1998.[55][56] This act led to the formation of the Scottish Parliament in 1999.[57] After Scotland voted 'No' in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, additional powers were devolved to the Scottish Parliament after the Scotland Act 2016 reached royal assent.[56] Elections to determine the composition of the Parliament take place once every five years under the additional member system.[57] Overall, there are 73 constituency members (MSPs) and 56 regional members elected.[57] Before 2016, elections were held every four years.[57]\nIn the inaugural two elections, Labour were the largest party and formed a coalition with the Scottish Liberal Democrats on both occasions.[57] However, Labour narrowly lost the 2007 election to the Scottish National Party (SNP).[57] By seats won, Labour have been the third largest party in the Scottish Parliament behind the SNP and Conservatives since 2016.[57] In the most recent election in 2021, Labour suffered their worst defeat in Holyrood after returning 22 MSPs.[58]\nAs part of Labour's 1997 winning UK general election manifesto, Labour committed to devolving power to Wales and Scotland subject to public consent from referendums.[60] In July 1997, Labour released its white paper for devolution in Wales.[60] This devolution deal would include 60 elected members who would take responsibility for \u00a37 billion of funding.[60] Furthermore, this new Assembly would have the right to pass secondary legislation in order to modify already existing laws.[60] The devolution plans were endorsed by the public in the 1997 Welsh devolution referendum by 50.3% of the vote.[60] The Government of Wales Act 1998 would receive royal assent with the Assembly to be formed following the first election in May 1999.[60]\nIn 1999, the Welsh Assembly or Senedd Cymru was founded.[61] From 1999 until 2011, Welsh Assembly elections were held once every four years, they are now held every five years.[61] 40 Constituency Assembly Members (AMs) and 20 regional Assembly Members are elected at each election.[61] The current voting system is the additional member system.[61]\nAt every Senedd election, Labour has received the most votes and seats at each election, but has never formed a clear majority of seats.[61] Labour formed a coalition with the Welsh Liberal Democrats from 2000 to 2003.[61] From 2003 to 2007, Labour governed alone as a minority administration before serving in coalition with Plaid Cymru from 2007 to 2011.[61] Labour have governed alone as a minority administration since 2011.[61] Since 2021, Labour have had a formal cooperation agreement with Plaid Cymru to help pass budgets and to work together on several policy areas.[62]\nLondon Assembly elections are held every four years.[64] O\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The opposition Labour Party, led by Keir Starmer, won a landslide victory over the governing Conservative Party under Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, ending 14 years of Conservative government.[3]\nLabour secured 411 seats[f][b] and a 174-seat majority, the third-best showing in the party's history and its best since 2001. The party's vote share was 33.7%, the lowest of any governing party on record, making this the least proportional general election in British history.[4] They became the largest party in England, Scotland and Wales. The Conservatives suffered their worst-ever defeat, winning 121 seats with 23.7% of the vote and losing 251 seats, including those of the former prime minister Liz Truss and 12 Cabinet ministers.[5]\nSmaller parties saw record support, with 42.6% of the total vote. The Liberal Democrats, led by Ed Davey, became the third-largest party with 72 seats, their best result ever and better than any Liberal Party result since 1923. Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, won five seats and 14.3% of the vote, the third-highest vote share, and the Green Party won four seats. For both parties this was their best parliamentary result to date.\nIn Scotland the Scottish National Party dropped from 48 to 9 seats, losing its status as Scotland's largest party.[6] In Wales, Plaid Cymru won four seats. In Northern Ireland, which has a distinct set of political parties,[7] Sinn F\u00e9in retained seven seats; the first election in which an Irish nationalist party won the most seats in Northern Ireland. The Democratic Unionist Party dropped from 8 to 5 seats.\nCampaign issues included the economy, healthcare, housing, energy and immigration. There was relatively little discussion of Brexit, which was a major issue during the 2019 general election. This was the first general election under the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act 2022, the first with photo identification required to vote in Great Britain,[g] and the first fought using the new constituency boundaries implemented following the 2023 review of Westminster constituencies.[8]\nThe Conservative Party under Boris Johnson won a large majority at the 2019 general election and the new government passed the Brexit withdrawal agreement.[9][10] The COVID-19 pandemic saw the government institute extensive public health restrictions, including limitations on social interaction, that Johnson and some of his staff were later found to have broken. The resulting political scandal (Partygate), one of many controversies during Johnson's premiership, saw the Conservatives lose their poll lead.[11][12] These scandals culminated in the resignation of over 50 ministers from the Government following allegations of sexual misconduct against a government minister. Johnson resigned as prime minister in July 2022.[13] He resigned as an MP the following year,[14] after an investigation unanimously found that he had lied to Parliament.[15]\nLiz Truss won the resultant leadership election and succeeded Johnson in September.[16][17] Truss announced large-scale tax cuts and borrowing in a mini-budget on 23 September, although many of its measures were reversed following financial instability.[18] She resigned in October, making her the shortest-serving prime minister in British history,[19] and was succeeded unopposed by Rishi Sunak.[20]\nDuring his premiership, Sunak was credited with improving the economy and stabilising national politics following the premierships of his predecessors,[21] although many of his pledges and policy announcements ultimately went unfulfilled.[22][23] He did not avert further unpopularity for the Conservatives who, by the time of Sunak's election, had been in government for 12 years. Public opinion in favour of a change in government was reflected in the Conservatives' poor performance at the 2022, 2023 and 2024 local elections.[24]\nKeir Starmer won the Labour Party's 2020 leadership election, succeeding Jeremy Corbyn.[25] Under his leadership, Starmer repositioned the party away from the left and toward the political centre, and emphasised the elimination of antisemitism within the party.[26][27] Starmer's leading his party rightward in order to improve its electability has been widely compared to Tony Blair's development of New Labour in the 1990s. The political turmoil from the Conservative scandals and government crises led to Labour having a significant lead in polling over the Conservatives, often by very wide margins, since late 2021, coinciding with the start of the Partygate scandal.[11][12] Labour made gains in local elections: in the 2023 local elections, Labour gained more than 500 councillors and 22 councils, becoming the largest party in local government for the first time since 2002.[28]\nEd Davey, who previously served in the Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition, won the Liberal Democrats' 2020 leadership election, succeeding Jo Swinson, who lost her seat in the previous general election.[29] Davey prioritised defeating the Conservatives and ruled out working with them following the election.[30] The Liberal Democrats made gains in local elections: in the 2024 local elections, the Liberal Democrats finished second for the first time in a local election cycle since 2009.[31]\nLike the Conservatives, the Scottish National Party (SNP) suffered political turmoil and saw a decrease in their popularity in opinion polling, with multiple party leaders and First Ministers (Nicola Sturgeon, Humza Yousaf and John Swinney) and the Operation Branchform police investigation. Sturgeon claimed occupational burnout was the reason for her resignation,[32] while Yousaf resigned amid a government crisis following his termination of a power-sharing agreement with the Scottish Greens.[33] When Swinney assumed the leadership after being elected unopposed to succeed Yousaf, the SNP had been \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Most of the seats up this year were last fought in 2021. Table 1 shows how party support in the opinion polls has changed since then. Reform UK are ahead, just, and never before in England has vote intention been so evenly divided between five parties.\nTable 1. Opinion poll changes from 2021 locals to 2025 locals (GB)\nHow might these changes translate into net changes in local council seats?\nThe first two graphs below show how \u2014 under Conservative governments \u2014 the shares of seats up gained or lost by the Conservatives and Labour were relatively closely related to the Conservative-Labour swing in the polls. Swings to Labour were followed by council seat gains for Labour and losses for the Conservatives. Last year was no exception.\nNow we have a Labour government, things may be different. During the Blair-Brown years Labour consistently suffered net losses and the Conservatives consistently made net gains, almost regardless of the swing in the polls between those two parties. (The regression lines in the two graphs below are essentially flat.) Moreover, in the first set of local elections after Labour came to power, the Conservatives made gains and Labour suffered net losses despite a swing to Labour in the polls between 1994 and 1998. On the basis of the pattern of local elections under New Labour, we might expect net gains and losses in the order of 8 per cent of the seats up every year. If that happens this week then it will roughly Labour -130 and Conservative +130.\nLiberal Democrat local seat tallies in England have historically been linked primarily to the swing between them and the Conservatives. In the graph below the regression line is fitted excluding the coalition years (2011 to 2014), when the Lib Dems suffered even heavier losses than the Lib Dem to Conservative poll swings would normally imply.\nDuring the Labour government years, Liberal Democrat gains and losses were modest, but they were positively correlated with the party\u2019s performance in the polls.\nIn recent years the Greens have been making steady gains at local elections. But intriguingly the scale of the net gains (as a proportion of the seats up for election) has not varied much with their performance in the polls.\nReform UK won just 2 seats in each of the last three rounds of local elections. Their predecessor, the Brexit Party, did not contest the 2019 local elections. Before that, UKIP were the largest populist right party. Under Nigel Farage they made net gains of +139 and +163 in 2013 and 2014 respectively. At the time these developments were big news, but as the graph below shows \u2014 as a proportion of the seats up \u2014 only the 2013 performance was comparable to their rise in the opinion polls. In 2014 UKIP were up 14 points in the polls but made net gains of seats amounting to less than 4 per cent of the seats up. Even more strikingly, last year Reform were up nearly 12 points in the polls, but they only won 2 seats out of 2659: less than 0.08%.

Both 2013 and this year are English county council election years. In 2013 UKIP contested 72.8% of the seats, much more than the party typically managed. Last year Reform only contested 11.5% of seats. This year Reform are contesting virtually all the seats, with more candidates than any other party. That greater number of candidates, together with their support in the polls reaching a critical level, might mean Reform translate their level of support in the polls into a similar, or greater, share of seats.\nLocal Seat Forecasts\nMy local election forecasts are based on regression models of seat share change on opinion poll share.

Instead of swing, for Table 2 the regression model for the Conservatives uses just the Conservative poll change, and likewise for Labour. Both parties are down heavily in the polls since 2021, so both are projected to make substantial net losses.

For the Greens, that method produces a forecast very similar to the 50+ net gains a regression model suggests. For Reform, regression models only project +100 gains, because they extrapolate the generally poor record of UKIP and Reform in translating popularity in the polls to seats in councils.

Most of the seats up this year were last fought in 2021. Table 1 shows how party support in the opinion polls has changed since then. Reform UK are ahead, just, and never before in England has vote intention been so evenly divided between five parties.\nTable 1. Opinion poll changes from 2021 locals to 2025 locals (GB)\nHow might these changes translate into net changes in local council seats?\nThe first two graphs below show how \u2014 under Conservative governments \u2014 the shares of seats up gained or lost by the Conservatives and Labour were relatively closely related to the Conservative-Labour swing in the polls. Swings to Labour were followed by council seat gains for Labour and losses for the Conservatives. Last year was no exception.\nNow we have a Labour government, things may be different. During the Blair-Brown years Labour consistently suffered net losses and the Conservatives consistently made net gains, almost regardless of the swing in the polls between those two parties. (The regression lines in the two graphs below are essentially flat.) Moreover, in the first set of local elections after Labour came to power, the Conservatives made gains and Labour suffered net losses despite a swing to Labour in the polls between 1994 and 1998. On the basis of the pattern of local elections under New Labour, we might expect net gains and losses in the order of 8 per cent of the seats up every year. If that happens this week then it will roughly Labour -130 and Conservative +130.\nLiberal Democrat local seat tallies in England have historically been linked primarily to the swing between them and the Conservatives. In the graph below the regression line is fitted excluding the coalition years (2011 to 2014), when the Lib Dems suffered even heavier losses than the Lib Dem to Conservative poll swings would normally imply.\nDuring the Labour government years, Liberal Democrat gains and losses were modest, but they were positively correlated with the party\u2019s performance in the polls.\nIn recent years the Greens have been making steady gains at local elections. But intriguingly the scale of the net gains (as a proportion of the seats up for election) has not varied much with their performance in the polls.\nReform UK won just 2 seats in each of the last three rounds of local elections. Their predecessor, the Brexit Party, did not contest the 2019 local elections. Before that, UKIP were the largest populist right party. Under Nigel Farage they made net gains of +139 and +163 in 2013 and 2014 respectively. At the time these developments were big news, but as the graph below shows \u2014 as a proportion of the seats up \u2014 only the 2013 performance was comparable to their rise in the opinion polls. In 2014 UKIP were up 14 points in the polls but made net gains of seats amounting to less than 4 per cent of the seats up. Even more strikingly, last year Reform were up nearly 12 points in the polls, but they only won 2 seats out of 2659: less than 0.08%. At that rate they will again win just 2 seats this year despite being first in the opinion polls.\nBut there are good reasons to think Reform UK will do a better job of translating votes to local council seats this week.

Nominations closed on 24 February 2023 with three candidates: Kate Forbes, Ash Regan, and Humza Yousaf being presented to the electorate of party members. Yousaf was elected the new leader on 27 March with 48.2% of first preference votes and 52.1% of the vote after third-placed candidate Regan's second preferences were redistributed. Yousaf was elected as the First Minister of Scotland on 28 March 2023.\nThis was the first contested leadership election in the SNP in nearly twenty years as Sturgeon was elected unopposed in the previous election held in 2014. During the course of the election, both the party's chief executive, Peter Murrell (also Sturgeon's husband), and MSP group media chief, Murray Foote, resigned from their positions on 18 and 17 March, respectively, over inaccurate party's membership numbers being communicated.[1]\nIn 2004, Alex Salmond became leader of the SNP, having previously led the party from 1990 to 2000. In the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, the SNP won a plurality of votes and seats and Salmond became the first minister of Scotland. In the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, the SNP won a majority of seats on a platform of delivering a referendum on Scottish independence. This referendum took place in 2014, with the question \"should Scotland become an independent country?\". A majority of voters, 55.3%, answered \"no\", and Salmond resigned as leader and first minister.[2] His deputy first minister since 2007 and depute leader of the SNP since 2004, Nicola Sturgeon, was elected unopposed as his successor.[3]\nSturgeon led the SNP in the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, forming a minority government. She again led the party into the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, which led to a power-sharing agreement with the Scottish Greens. Over the same period, the party won a majority of seats in each of the 2015, 2017, and 2019 general elections, winning all but three seats in Scotland in the 2015 election. Sturgeon's government advocated for another Scottish independence referendum, but in 2022 the UK Supreme Court ruled they did not have the legal standing to hold one without agreement from Westminster.[4][5][6] On 25 May 2022, she became the longest-serving first minister of Scotland since the role was established in 1999, surpassing the record held by Salmond.[7]\nOn 15 February 2023, Sturgeon announced her intention to stand down as the leader of the SNP and first minister, saying that she would remain in office until a new leader was elected.[8][9] Sturgeon insisted that her resignation was not due to \"short term pressures\" but said that the job \"takes its toll on you.\"[10] She said she would remain in office as a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) until the next Scottish Parliament election, expected to be held in 2026.[11] On 2 March, John Swinney, the Deputy First Minister, and only person other than Sturgeon to be in Cabinet since the SNP came to power in 2007, also announced that after 16 years he planned to leave Government following the contest.[12] Sturgeon's husband, Peter Murrell, initially remained the SNP's chief executive, although there were calls for him to resign.[13][14][15] However, he would subsequently resign on 18 March.[1]\nSturgeon said that the timing of her decision was determined by an impending special SNP conference to decide the party's strategy on independence, which had been due to take place on 19 March 2023. Her proposal for the event was that the next general or Scottish Parliament election should be treated as a de facto referendum on independence.[16] This plan was controversial within the party.[17] Among others, the leader of the SNP in the House of Commons, Stephen Flynn, called for the conference to be postponed following Sturgeon's resignation.[18][19] The party's national executive committee decided on 16 February 2023 to postpone it.[20]\nSturgeon's resignation came following years during which the party's reputation for discipline had been frayed, two years after the conclusion of an inquiry into the handling of complaints of sexual harassment against her predecessor, of which he was acquitted in court in 2020, after which inquiry Salmond launched the electorally unsuccessful splinter Alba Party. It came during an ongoing dispute over the Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill and an ongoing fraud investigation into the SNP.[21][22] It followed two months after a change in leadership at the SNP Westminster group, after Ian Blackford, seen as an ally of Sturgeon, denied being forced out by other MPs,[23] where Alison Thewliss, also seen as an ally of Sturgeon,[24] was defeated.\nThe Scottish Greens stated they would decide whether to continue the power-sharing agreement with the SNP after the new leader was chosen.[25]\nThere were three main issues in the leadership campaign: economics, Scottish independence, and gender recognition reform.[26]\nBefore the leadership election, the SNP government in Scotland and their coalition partners in the Scottish Green Party were criticised by critics on the right of being \"anti-growth\" with a rejection of new drilling for oil and gas, a bottle recycling scheme, and curbs on advertising alcohol. Meanwhile, critics on the left have accused the government of adopting neoliberal economic policies, selling off green energy resources, and supporting free ports.[26]\nForbes was seen as being the most friendly candidate for business. The power-sharing agreement with the Greens was seen to be under threat from either Forbes or Regan winning. All three candidates expressed concerns over the bottle recycling scheme.[26]\nThe SNP's strategy for achieving Scottish independence, the central goal of the party, was expected to be one of the main issue\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

What does this mean for the ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nRishi Sunak Conservative\nKeir Starmer Labour\nThe 2024 United Kingdom general election was held on Thursday, 4 July 2024 to elect all 650 members of the House of Commons. The opposition Labour Party, led by Keir Starmer, won a landslide victory over the governing Conservative Party under Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, ending 14 years of Conservative government.[3]\nLabour secured 411 seats[f][b] and a 174-seat majority, the third-best showing in the party's history and its best since 2001. The party's vote share was 33.7%, the lowest of any governing party on record, making this the least proportional general election in British history.[4] They became the largest party in England, Scotland and Wales. The Conservatives suffered their worst-ever defeat, winning 121 seats with 23.7% of the vote and losing 251 seats, including those of the former prime minister Liz Truss and 12 Cabinet ministers.[5]\nSmaller parties saw record support, with 42.6% of the total vote. The Liberal Democrats, led by Ed Davey, became the third-largest party with 72 seats, their best result ever and better than any Liberal Party result since 1923. Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, won five seats and 14.3% of the vote, the third-highest vote share, and the Green Party won four seats. For both parties this was their best parliamentary result to date.\nIn Scotland the Scottish National Party dropped from 48 to 9 seats, losing its status as Scotland's largest party.[6] In Wales, Plaid Cymru won four seats. In Northern Ireland, which has a distinct set of political parties,[7] Sinn F\u00e9in retained seven seats; the first election in which an Irish nationalist party won the most seats in Northern Ireland. The Democratic Unionist Party dropped from 8 to 5 seats.\nCampaign issues included the economy, healthcare, housing, energy and immigration. There was relatively little discussion of Brexit, which was a major issue during the 2019 general election. This was the first general election under the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act 2022, the first with photo identification required to vote in Great Britain,[g] and the first fought using the new constituency boundaries implemented following the 2023 review of Westminster constituencies.[8]\nThe Conservative Party under Boris Johnson won a large majority at the 2019 general election and the new government passed the Brexit withdrawal agreement.[9][10] The COVID-19 pandemic saw the government institute extensive public health restrictions, including limitations on social interaction, that Johnson and some of his staff were later found to have broken. The resulting political scandal (Partygate), one of many controversies during Johnson's premiership, saw the Conservatives lose their poll lead.[11][12] These scandals culminated in the resignation of over 50 ministers from the Government following allegations of sexual misconduct against a government minister. Johnson resigned as prime minister in July 2022.[13] He resigned as an MP the following year,[14] after an investigation unanimously found that he had lied to Parliament.[15]\nLiz Truss won the resultant leadership election and succeeded Johnson in September.[16][17] Truss announced large-scale tax cuts and borrowing in a mini-budget on 23 September, although many of its measures were reversed following financial instability.[18] She resigned in October, making her the shortest-serving prime minister in British history,[19] and was succeeded unopposed by Rishi Sunak.[20]\nDuring his premiership, Sunak was credited with improving the economy and stabilising national politics following the premierships of his predecessors,[21] although many of his pledges and policy announcements ultimately went unfulfilled.[22][23] He did not avert further unpopularity for the Conservatives who, by the time of Sunak's election, had been in government for 12 years. Public opinion in favour of a change in government was reflected in the Conservatives' poor performance at the 2022, 2023 and 2024 local elections.[24]\nKeir Starmer won the Labour Party's 2020 leadership election, succeeding Jeremy Corbyn.[25] Under his leadership, Starmer repositioned the party away from the left and toward the political centre, and emphasised the elimination of antisemitism within the party.[26][27] Starmer's leading his party rightward in order to improve its electability has been widely compared to Tony Blair's development of New Labour in the 1990s. The political turmoil from the Conservative scandals and government crises led to Labour having a significant lead in polling over the Conservatives, often by very wide margins, since late 2021, coinciding with the start of the Partygate scandal.[11][12] Labour made gains in local elections: in the 2023 local elections, Labour gained more than 500 councillors and 22 councils, becoming the largest party in local government for the first time since 2002.[28]\nEd Davey, who previously served in the Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition, won the Liberal Democrats' 2020 leadership election, succeeding Jo Swinson, who lost her seat in the previous general election.[29] Davey prioritised defeating the Conservatives and ruled out working with them following the election.[30] The Liberal Democrats made gains in local elections: in the 2024 local elections, the Liberal Democrats finished second for the first time in a local election cycle since 2009.[31]\nLike the Conservatives, the Scottish National Party (SNP) suffered political turmoil and saw a decrease in their popularity in opinion polling, with multiple party leaders and First Ministers (Nicola Sturgeon, Humza Yousaf and John Swinney) and the Operation Branchform police investigation. Sturgeon claimed occupational burnout was the reason for her resignation,[32] while Yousaf resigned amid a government crisis following his termination of a power-sharing agreement with the Scottish Greens.[33] When Swinney assumed the leadership after being elected unopposed to succeed Yousaf, the SNP had been \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

With the Tories' reputation for economic excellence in shreds, from this stage on Labour was ascendant in the polls.\nThe whole of the parliament was dominated by open Tory feuding on Europe and this bickering was responsible for the government's defeat on the Maastricht Bill in 1993 as well as for John Redwood's 1995 leadership challenge.\nSleaze, as well as splits, also hit the party with 12 resignations from office taking place over allegations of personal impropriety, among the most famous being Jonathan Aitken and Neil Hamilton.\nLabour also had an eventful parliament. John Smith replaced Neil Kinnock as leader, but died of a heart attack in May 1994.\nHe was replaced by the shadow home secretary, Tony Blair.\nUnder Blair the \"modernisation\" process set in train by Neil Kinnock stepped up several gears, as the party ditched the commitment to nationalisation set out in Clause IV of its constitution and took to referring to itself as New Labour.\nWith Blair at the helm the polls briefly registered a Labour lead over the Tories' of above 30%. After the best part of 20 years in opposition, Labour's return to power at the next election looked a sure thing.\nCampaign\nJohn Major left it until the last possible minute before calling the 1997 election, in the hope that the \"feel-good factor\" that accompanies economic prosperity would turn around Tory fortunes in the polls.\nUnluckily for him, it never did.\nLeft with little alternative, Major hoped a long campaign - six weeks, from 17 March to polling day on 1 May - would expose New Labour's policies to scrutiny and see the party's relatively inexperienced leadership crack under pressure.\nBut in the face of a professional, super-disciplined and highly cautious campaign by a Labour Party fearful of losing an election it was overwhelmingly expected to win, the Tory strategy had little impact.\nLabour had adopted campaigning techniques from the US, including a rapid rebuttal unit designed to ensure a swift and sure response to any Conservative attacks on the party.\nThe party's campaigners were kept ruthlessly on-message for the duration by fax, bleeper and mobile phone.\nThroughout the campaign the Tories experienced nothing but bad news. The Sun newspaper turned traitor on the party it had energetically championed at the previous four elections, now coming out for New Labour.\nSleaze blew the Tory campaign off course. An MP was revealed to be having an affair with a night-club hostess.\nAnd as the long weeks passed the Tories failed to land any punches on New Labour. Even the old bogey of Labour's relations with the unions failed to chime with many voters - many of whom had never lived under a Labour government.\nNeil Hamilton lost his Tatton seat to independent candidate Martin Bell With Tory splits on Europe on painful display throughout the campaign Major's party did much of Labour's work for it.\nOne of the few memorable episodes came when Labour and the Liberal Democrats agreed not to field candidates in Tatton after they had persuaded BBC journalist Martin Bell to stand on a independent ticket against Neil Hamilton.\nThe Tory MP strongly denied the sleaze allegations against him, and with his formidable wife confronted the war correspondent on Knutsford Heath in full view of the media.\nPersonalities\nTony Blair was by no means alone in creating what was to become New Labour, but he more than anyone else came to personify it.\nIt was under his leadership that the \"modernisation\" of the party was escalated to a degree not previously thought possible. The priority remained to strip away policies that he believed had lost the party the crucial support of the middle classes in 1992.\nBlair - a public school, Oxford-educated barrister - was no son of the left or the Labour movement, although he was a onetime supporter of CND.\nBefore becoming leader in 1994 he was shadow home secretary, but having entered Parliament in the Thatcher years he had no experience of government.\nAfter gaining the support of his powerful colleague and potential rival Gordon Brown for his leadership bid after John Smith's death, Blair won hands down in the contest between himself, John Prescott and Margaret Beckett.\nThe dramatic changes - in the face of disquiet - Blair oversaw to his own party allowed him to cast himself in the role of a strong, commanding leader, taunting John Major: \"l lead my party, he follows his\".\nFor John Major the 1992-1997 parliament had been a bruising ride.\nThe Tories lost their way as feuding over European policy and sleaze both pointed to a party tired after having spent nearly 20 years in office.\nPaddy Ashdown was the oldest party leader Things got so bad between Major and members of his own cabinet he was even caught on tape referring to several of them as \"bastards\".\nBut despite the Tor\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

In recent years, changes in vote-intention opinion polls have generally provided a reasonable guide to ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nBy Stephen Fisher, 30th April 2025.\nIn recent years, changes in vote-intention opinion polls have generally provided a reasonable guide to headline gains and losses at local elections. Most of the seats up this year were last fought in 2021. Table 1 shows how party support in the opinion polls has changed since then. Reform UK are ahead, just, and never before in England has vote intention been so evenly divided between five parties.\nTable 1. Opinion poll changes from 2021 locals to 2025 locals (GB)\nHow might these changes translate into net changes in local council seats?\nThe first two graphs below show how \u2014 under Conservative governments \u2014 the shares of seats up gained or lost by the Conservatives and Labour were relatively closely related to the Conservative-Labour swing in the polls. Swings to Labour were followed by council seat gains for Labour and losses for the Conservatives. Last year was no exception.\nNow we have a Labour government, things may be different. During the Blair-Brown years Labour consistently suffered net losses and the Conservatives consistently made net gains, almost regardless of the swing in the polls between those two parties. (The regression lines in the two graphs below are essentially flat.) Moreover, in the first set of local elections after Labour came to power, the Conservatives made gains and Labour suffered net losses despite a swing to Labour in the polls between 1994 and 1998. On the basis of the pattern of local elections under New Labour, we might expect net gains and losses in the order of 8 per cent of the seats up every year. If that happens this week then it will roughly Labour -130 and Conservative +130.\nLiberal Democrat local seat tallies in England have historically been linked primarily to the swing between them and the Conservatives. In the graph below the regression line is fitted excluding the coalition years (2011 to 2014), when the Lib Dems suffered even heavier losses than the Lib Dem to Conservative poll swings would normally imply.\nDuring the Labour government years, Liberal Democrat gains and losses were modest, but they were positively correlated with the party\u2019s performance in the polls.\nIn recent years the Greens have been making steady gains at local elections. But intriguingly the scale of the net gains (as a proportion of the seats up for election) has not varied much with their performance in the polls.\nReform UK won just 2 seats in each of the last three rounds of local elections. Their predecessor, the Brexit Party, did not contest the 2019 local elections. Before that, UKIP were the largest populist right party. Under Nigel Farage they made net gains of +139 and +163 in 2013 and 2014 respectively. At the time these developments were big news, but as the graph below shows \u2014 as a proportion of the seats up \u2014 only the 2013 performance was comparable to their rise in the opinion polls. In 2014 UKIP were up 14 points in the polls but made net gains of seats amounting to less than 4 per cent of the seats up. Even more strikingly, last year Reform were up nearly 12 points in the polls, but they only won 2 seats out of 2659: less than 0.08%. At that rate they will again win just 2 seats this year despite being first in the opinion polls.\nBut there are good reasons to think Reform UK will do a better job of translating votes to local council seats this week. There was one year when the size of UKIP\u2019s local election seat tally reflected their rise in the polls, which is a particularly relevant point of comparison this year. Both 2013 and this year are English county council election years. In 2013 UKIP contested 72.8% of the seats, much more than the party typically managed. Last year Reform only contested 11.5% of seats. This year Reform are contesting virtually all the seats, with more candidates than any other party. That greater number of candidates, together with their support in the polls reaching a critical level, might mean Reform translate their level of support in the polls into a similar, or greater, share of seats.\nLocal Seat Forecasts\nMy local election forecasts are based on regression models of seat share change on opinion poll share. In recent years I have used Conservative to Labour swing in the polls to forecast seats for those parties. This year, given the rise of Reform, that approach would implausibly suggest a modest set of gains for Labour and losses for the Conservatives. Instead of swing, for Table 2 the regression model for the Conservatives uses just the Conservative poll change, and likewise for Labour. Both parties are down heavily in the polls since 2021, so both are projected to make substantial net losses. (Given that experience of the Blair/Brown years discussed above may not be repeated, the regressions are run using all local elections since 1985 that were not on the same day as a general election.)\nTable 2. Model-based forecasts for net seat gains/losses at 2025 local elections\nThe Liberal Democrat model is unchanged from last year. It is based on Con-LD swing, with allowance for additional losses during the coalition years.\nFor the Greens and Reform, the forecasts are simply what those parties should get if they get an additional 1% of the seats up for every extra percentage point increase in their poll rating since 2021. For the Greens, that method produces a forecast very similar to the 50+ net gains a regression model suggests. For Reform, regression models only project +100 gains, because they extrapolate the generally poor record of UKIP and Reform in translating popularity in the polls to seats in councils. Instead, the +375 forecast Reform gains provides a reasonable benchmark of what Reform should achieve to match their showing in the opinion polls.\nThe figure for Others in Table 2 is just an accounting balance. All five party forecasts are estimated separately.\nThe models do not take into account the number of seats each party is defending. Since English shires are traditionally Conser\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

With the Tories' reputation for economic excellence in shreds, from this stage on Labour was ascendant in the polls.\nThe whole of the parliament was dominated by open Tory feuding on Europe and this bickering was responsible for the government's defeat on the Maastricht Bill in 1993 as well as for John Redwood's 1995 leadership challenge.\nSleaze, as well as splits, also hit the party with 12 resignations from office taking place over allegations of personal impropriety, among the most famous being Jonathan Aitken and Neil Hamilton.\nLabour also had an eventful parliament. John Smith replaced Neil Kinnock as leader, but died of a heart attack in May 1994.\nHe was replaced by the shadow home secretary, Tony Blair.\nUnder Blair the \"modernisation\" process set in train by Neil Kinnock stepped up several gears, as the party ditched the commitment to nationalisation set out in Clause IV of its constitution and took to referring to itself as New Labour.\nWith Blair at the helm the polls briefly registered a Labour lead over the Tories' of above 30%. After the best part of 20 years in opposition, Labour's return to power at the next election looked a sure thing.\nCampaign\nJohn Major left it until the last possible minute before calling the 1997 election, in the hope that the \"feel-good factor\" that accompanies economic prosperity would turn around Tory fortunes in the polls.\nUnluckily for him, it never did.\nLeft with little alternative, Major hoped a long campaign - six weeks, from 17 March to polling day on 1 May - would expose New Labour's policies to scrutiny and see the party's relatively inexperienced leadership crack under pressure.\nBut in the face of a professional, super-disciplined and highly cautious campaign by a Labour Party fearful of losing an election it was overwhelmingly expected to win, the Tory strategy had little impact.\nLabour had adopted campaigning techniques from the US, including a rapid rebuttal unit designed to ensure a swift and sure response to any Conservative attacks on the party.\nThe party's campaigners were kept ruthlessly on-message for the duration by fax, bleeper and mobile phone.\nThroughout the campaign the Tories experienced nothing but bad news. The Sun newspaper turned traitor on the party it had energetically championed at the previous four elections, now coming out for New Labour.\nSleaze blew the Tory campaign off course. An MP was revealed to be having an affair with a night-club hostess.\nAnd as the long weeks passed the Tories failed to land any punches on New Labour. Even the old bogey of Labour's relations with the unions failed to chime with many voters - many of whom had never lived under a Labour government.\nNeil Hamilton lost his Tatton seat to independent candidate Martin Bell With Tory splits on Europe on painful display throughout the campaign Major's party did much of Labour's work for it.\nOne of the few memorable episodes came when Labour and the Liberal Democrats agreed not to field candidates in Tatton after they had persuaded BBC journalist Martin Bell to stand on a independent ticket against Neil Hamilton.\nThe Tory MP strongly denied the sleaze allegations against him, and with his formidable wife confronted the war correspondent on Knutsford Heath in full view of the media.\nPersonalities\nTony Blair was by no means alone in creating what was to become New Labour, but he more than anyone else came to personify it.\nIt was under his leadership that the \"modernisation\" of the party was escalated to a degree not previously thought possible. The priority remained to strip away policies that he believed had lost the party the crucial support of the middle classes in 1992.\nBlair - a public school, Oxford-educated barrister - was no son of the left or the Labour movement, although he was a onetime supporter of CND.\nBefore becoming leader in 1994 he was shadow home secretary, but having entered Parliament in the Thatcher years he had no experience of government.\nAfter gaining the support of his powerful colleague and potential rival Gordon Brown for his leadership bid after John Smith's death, Blair won hands down in the contest between himself, John Prescott and Margaret Beckett.\nThe dramatic changes - in the face of disquiet - Blair oversaw to his own party allowed him to cast himself in the role of a strong, commanding leader, taunting John Major: \"l lead my party, he follows his\".\nFor John Major the 1992-1997 parliament had been a bruising ride.\nThe Tories lost their way as feuding over European policy and sleaze both pointed to a party tired after having spent nearly 20 years in office.\nPaddy Ashdown was the oldest party leader Things got so bad between Major and members of his own cabinet he was even caught on tape referring to several of them as \"bastards\".\nBut despite the Tor\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The party's vote share was 33.7%, the lowest of any governing party on record, making this the least proportional general election in British history.[4] They became the largest party in England, Scotland and Wales. The Conservatives suffered their worst-ever defeat, winning 121 seats with 23.7% of the vote and losing 251 seats, including those of the former prime minister Liz Truss and 12 Cabinet ministers.[5]\nSmaller parties saw record support, with 42.6% of the total vote. The Liberal Democrats, led by Ed Davey, became the third-largest party with 72 seats, their best result ever and better than any Liberal Party result since 1923. Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, won five seats and 14.3% of the vote, the third-highest vote share, and the Green Party won four seats. For both parties this was their best parliamentary result to date.\nIn Scotland the Scottish National Party dropped from 48 to 9 seats, losing its status as Scotland's largest party.[6] In Wales, Plaid Cymru won four seats.

The party's vote share was 33.7%, the lowest of any governing party on record, making this the least proportional general election in British history.[4] They became the largest party in England, Scotland and Wales. The Conservatives suffered their worst-ever defeat, winning 121 seats with 23.7% of the vote and losing 251 seats, including those of the former prime minister Liz Truss and 12 Cabinet ministers.[5]\nSmaller parties saw record support, with 42.6% of the total vote. The Liberal Democrats, led by Ed Davey, became the third-largest party with 72 seats, their best result ever and better than any Liberal Party result since 1923. Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, won five seats and 14.3% of the vote, the third-highest vote share, and the Green Party won four seats. For both parties this was their best parliamentary result to date.\nIn Scotland the Scottish National Party dropped from 48 to 9 seats, losing its status as Scotland's largest party.[6] In Wales, Plaid Cymru won four seats. In Northern Ireland, which has a distinct set of political parties,[7] Sinn F\u00e9in retained seven seats; the first election in which an Irish nationalist party won the most seats in Northern Ireland.

The election saw a resurgence of Labour within Scotland, with the party winning 37 seats, an increase of 36 from the previous election and becoming the largest party in Scotland for the first time since 2010. The Liberal Democrats also saw gains, increasing their Scottish representation in Parliament from four seats to six. The Scottish National Party, the dominant party in Scotland since 2007, saw a collapse of support in which they lost 39 seats, bringing their total from 48 seats won at the previous election to nine. This was their worst Westminster election result since 2010. The Conservative Party lost one seat, taking their total down to five. Turnout dropped to 59%, eclipsed for the first time by a preceding Scottish Parliament election (63.5%). This was a reduction in turnout of 8.4% from 2019 and in a few constituencies the turnout was down 10%.\nThe Scottish National Party (SNP) suffered political turmoil through having multiple party leaders and First Ministers including Nicola Sturgeon, Humza Yousaf and John Swinney, as well as the Operation Branchform police investigation into the party's finances. Sturgeon resigned following heavy criticism for her positions on gender reforms and claimed occupational burnout was the reason for her resignation,[2] while Yousaf resigned amid a government crisis following his termination of a power-sharing agreement with the Scottish Greens.[3] Swinney assumed the leadership after being elected unopposed.[4] Like the Conservative Party in the UK, the SNP's popularity also suffered from being in government for a long time, which led to speculation that Scottish Labour could win the election for the first time since their near-wipeout in the 2015 general election.\nAll polling companies listed here are members of the British Polling Council (BPC) and abide by its disclosure and sample size rules.\nThe dates for these opinion polls range from the 2019 general election on 12 December to the election day itself.\nIn March 2020, Cabinet Office minister Chloe Smith confirmed that the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies would be based on retaining 650 seats.[10][11] The previous relevant legislation was amended by the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 2020[12] and the four boundary commissions formally launched their 2023 reviews on 5 January 2021.[13][14][15][16] They were required to issue their final reports prior to 1 July 2023. The Scottish commission published its own report on 28 June.[17][18] As the reports were laid before Parliament, Orders in Council giving effect to the final proposals must be made within four months, unless \"there are exceptional circumstances\". Prior to the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 2020, boundary changes could not be implemented until they were approved by both Houses of Parliament.\nFifty-seven single member constituencies were used in Scotland for this election, a reduction of two since 2019. A number of constituencies are unchanged, including the two protected constituencies of Na h-Eileanan an Iar covering the Western Isles, and Orkney and Shetland, covering the Northern Isles.[19]\nBold meant the candidate was elected.\nThe SNP ultimately won nine seats in the 2024 election, a loss of 38 seats on its 2019 result, reducing it to the second-largest party in Scotland, behind Scottish Labour, and the fourth-largest party in Westminster. Swinney took full responsibility but said that he would not resign as leader. He said of the results, \"There will have to be a lot of soul searching as a party as a consequence of these results that have come in tonight\", and that the SNP has to be \"better at governing on behalf of the people of Scotland\", admitting the party was not \"winning the argument\" on Scottish independence.[32]\nOn 7 July 2024, newly elected Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Keir Starmer travelled to Edinburgh on the first stop of his tour of the four countries of the United Kingdom and met with Swinney at the official residence of the First Minister, Bute House. During the meeting, both Swinney and Starmer agreed to \"work together\" and to \"reset the relationship between their two governments\".[33]\nVoting closed at 22:00, which was followed by an exit poll. The first seat, Houghton and Sunderland South, declared at 23:15 with Bridget Phillipson winning for Labour.[34][35] Inverness, Skye and West Ross-shire was the last seat to declare, after a recount took place on Saturday 6 July.[36]\nThe Scottish Labour Party gained the majority of seats in Scotland for the first time since 2010, regaining most of the seats lost to the SNP in 2015. Labour gained every seat in Glasgow, all but one seat in Edinburgh, and all but one seat in the Central Belt (both of these exceptions being seats won by the Scottish Liberal Democrats). Labour also gained Na h-Eileanan an Iar for the first time since 2001. Labour was also runner-up in four other constituencies, around Aberdeen and Dundee. Three of the Labour candidates elected were also members of the Co-operative Party, designated as Labour-Co-op, but usually simply counted under the Labour party figure.\nThe Scottish National Party elected nine MPs, a net loss of thirty-nine compared to 2019. The SNP lost most of their seats gained in 2015, including every seat in Glasgow, Edinburgh and the Central Belt. Most of the remaining SNP seats are large rural constituencies in the Scottish Highlands, along with Aberdeen North, Aberdeen South and Dundee Central, Dundee Central had the lowest majority of any Scottish constituency (675 votes between SNP and Labour). The only SNP gain was Aberdeenshire North and Moray East, the predecessor seat of Banff and Buchan had been previously Conservative. The SNP was the runner-up in every constituency it did not win.\nThe Scottish Liberal Democrats elected six MPs, gaining M\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The Conservatives suffered their worst-ever defeat, winning 121 seats with 23.7% of the vote and losing 251 seats, including those of the former prime minister Liz Truss and 12 Cabinet ministers.[5]\nSmaller parties saw record support, with 42.6% of the total vote. The Liberal Democrats, led by Ed Davey, became the third-largest party with 72 seats, their best result ever and better than any Liberal Party result since 1923. Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, won five seats and 14.3% of the vote, the third-highest vote share, and the Green Party won four seats. For both parties this was their best parliamentary result to date.\nIn Scotland the Scottish National Party dropped from 48 to 9 seats, losing its status as Scotland's largest party.[6] In Wales, Plaid Cymru won four seats. In Northern Ireland, which has a distinct set of political parties,[7] Sinn F\u00e9in retained seven seats; the first election in which an Irish nationalist party won the most seats in Northern Ireland. The Democratic Unionist Party dropped from 8 to 5 seats.\nCampaign issues included the economy, healthcare, housing, energy and immigration. There was relatively little discussion of Brexit, which was a major issue during the 2019 general election. This was the first general election under the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act 2022, the first with photo identification required to vote in Great Britain,[g] and the first fought using the new constituency boundaries implemented following the 2023 review of Westminster constituencies.[8]\nThe Conservative Party under Boris Johnson won a large majority at the 2019 general election and the new government passed the Brexit withdrawal agreement.[9][10] The COVID-19 pandemic saw the government institute extensive public health restrictions, including limitations on social interaction, that Johnson and some of his staff were later found to have broken. The resulting political scandal (Partygate), one of many controversies during Johnson's premiership, saw the Conservatives lose their poll lead.[11][12] These scandals culminated in the resignation of over 50 ministers from the Government following allegations of sexual misconduct against a government minister. Johnson resigned as prime minister in July 2022.[13] He resigned as an MP the following year,[14] after an investigation unanimously found that he had lied to Parliament.[15]\nLiz Truss won the resultant leadership election and succeeded Johnson in September.[16][17] Truss announced large-scale tax cuts and borrowing in a mini-budget on 23 September, although many of its measures were reversed following financial instability.[18] She resigned in October, making her the shortest-serving prime minister in British history,[19] and was succeeded unopposed by Rishi Sunak.[20]\nDuring his premiership, Sunak was credited with improving the economy and stabilising national politics following the premierships of his predecessors,[21] although many of his pledges and policy announcements ultimately went unfulfilled.[22][23] He did not avert further unpopularity for the Conservatives who, by the time of Sunak's election, had been in government for 12 years. Public opinion in favour of a change in government was reflected in the Conservatives' poor performance at the 2022, 2023 and 2024 local elections.[24]\nKeir Starmer won the Labour Party's 2020 leadership election, succeeding Jeremy Corbyn.[25] Under his leadership, Starmer repositioned the party away from the left and toward the political centre, and emphasised the elimination of antisemitism within the party.[26][27] Starmer's leading his party rightward in order to improve its electability has been widely compared to Tony Blair's development of New Labour in the 1990s. The political turmoil from the Conservative scandals and government crises led to Labour having a significant lead in polling over the Conservatives, often by very wide margins, since late 2021, coinciding with the start of the Partygate scandal.[11][12] Labour made gains in local elections: in the 2023 local elections, Labour gained more than 500 councillors and 22 councils, becoming the largest party in local government for the first time since 2002.[28]\nEd Davey, who previously served in the Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition, won the Liberal Democrats' 2020 leadership election, succeeding Jo Swinson, who lost her seat in the previous general election.[29] Davey prioritised defeating the Conservatives and ruled out working with them following the election.[30] The Liberal Democrats made gains in local elections: in the 2024 local elections, the Liberal Democrats finished second for the first time in a local election cycle since 2009.[31]\nLike the Conservatives, the Scottish National Party (SNP) suffered political turmoil and saw a decrease in their popularity in opinion polling, with multiple party leaders and First Ministers (Nicola Sturgeon, Humza Yousaf and John Swinney) and the Operation Branchform police investigation.

Most of the seats up this year were last fought in 2021. Table 1 shows how party support in the opinion polls has changed since then. Reform UK are ahead, just, and never before in England has vote intention been so evenly divided between five parties.\nTable 1. Opinion poll changes from 2021 locals to 2025 locals (GB)\nHow might these changes translate into net changes in local council seats?\nThe first two graphs below show how \u2014 under Conservative governments \u2014 the shares of seats up gained or lost by the Conservatives and Labour were relatively closely related to the Conservative-Labour swing in the polls. Swings to Labour were followed by council seat gains for Labour and losses for the Conservatives. Last year was no exception.\nNow we have a Labour government, things may be different. During the Blair-Brown years Labour consistently suffered net losses and the Conservatives consistently made net gains, almost regardless of the swing in the polls between those two parties. (The regression lines in the two graphs below are essentially flat.) Moreover, in the first set of local elections after Labour came to power, the Conservatives made gains and Labour suffered net losses despite a swing to Labour in the polls between 1994 and 1998. On the basis of the pattern of local elections under New Labour, we might expect net gains and losses in the order of 8 per cent of the seats up every year. If that happens this week then it will roughly Labour -130 and Conservative +130.\nLiberal Democrat local seat tallies in England have historically been linked primarily to the swing between them and the Conservatives. In the graph below the regression line is fitted excluding the coalition years (2011 to 2014), when the Lib Dems suffered even heavier losses than the Lib Dem to Conservative poll swings would normally imply.\nDuring the Labour government years, Liberal Democrat gains and losses were modest, but they were positively correlated with the party\u2019s performance in the polls.\nIn recent years the Greens have been making steady gains at local elections. But intriguingly the scale of the net gains (as a proportion of the seats up for election) has not varied much with their performance in the polls.\nReform UK won just 2 seats in each of the last three rounds of local elections. Their predecessor, the Brexit Party, did not contest the 2019 local elections. Before that, UKIP were the largest populist right party. Under Nigel Farage they made net gains of +139 and +163 in 2013 and 2014 respectively. At the time these developments were big news, but as the graph below shows \u2014 as a proportion of the seats up \u2014 only the 2013 performance was comparable to their rise in the opinion polls. In 2014 UKIP were up 14 points in the polls but made net gains of seats amounting to less than 4 per cent of the seats up. Even more strikingly, last year Reform were up nearly 12 points in the polls, but they only won 2 seats out of 2659: less than 0.08%. At that rate they will again win just 2 seats this year despite being first in the opinion polls.\nBut there are good reasons to think Reform UK will do a better job of translating votes to local council seats this week. There was one year when the size of UKIP\u2019s local election seat tally reflected their rise in the polls, which is a particularly relevant point of comparison this year. Both 2013 and this year are English county council election years. In 2013 UKIP contested 72.8% of the seats, much more than the party typically managed. Last year Reform only contested 11.5% of seats. This year Reform are contesting virtually all the seats, with more candidates than any other party. That greater number of candidates, together with their support in the polls reaching a critical level, might mean Reform translate their level of support in the polls into a similar, or greater, share of seats.\nLocal Seat Forecasts\nMy local election forecasts are based on regression models of seat share change on opinion poll share. In recent years I have used Conservative to Labour swing in the polls to forecast seats for those parties. This year, given the rise of Reform, that approach would implausibly suggest a modest set of gains for Labour and losses for the Conservatives. Instead of swing, for Table 2 the regression model for the Conservatives uses just the Conservative poll change, and likewise for Labour. Both parties are down heavily in the polls since 2021, so both are projected to make substantial net losses. (Given that experience of the Blair/Brown years discussed above may not be repeated, the regressions are run using all local elections since 1985 that were not on the same day as a general election.)\nTable 2. Model-based forecasts for net seat gains/losses at 2025 local elections\nThe Liberal Democrat model is unchanged from last year. It is based on Con-LD swing, with allowance for additional losses during the coalition years.\nFor the Greens and Reform, the forecasts are simply what those parties should get if they get an additional 1% of the seats up for every extra percentage point increase in their poll rating since 2021. For the Greens, that method produces a forecast very similar to the 50+ net gains a regression model suggests. For Reform, regression models only project +100 gains, because they extrapolate the generally poor record of UKIP and Reform in translating popularity in the polls to seats in councils. Instead, the +375 forecast Reform gains provides a reasonable benchmark of what Reform should achieve to match their showing in the opinion polls.\nThe figure for Others in Table 2 is just an accounting balance. All five party forecasts are estimated separately.\nThe models do not take into account the number of seats each party is defending. Since English shires are traditionally Conser\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

In Northern Ireland, which has a distinct set of political parties,[7] Sinn F\u00e9in retained seven seats; the first election in which an Irish nationalist party won the most seats in Northern Ireland. The Democratic Unionist Party dropped from 8 to 5 seats.\nCampaign issues included the economy, healthcare, housing, energy and immigration. There was relatively little discussion of Brexit, which was a major issue during the 2019 general election. This was the first general election under the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act 2022, the first with photo identification required to vote in Great Britain,[g] and the first fought using the new constituency boundaries implemented following the 2023 review of Westminster constituencies.[8]\nThe Conservative Party under Boris Johnson won a large majority at the 2019 general election and the new government passed the Brexit withdrawal agreement.[9][10] The COVID-19 pandemic saw the government institute extensive public health restrictions, including limitations on social interaction, that Johnson and some of his staff were later found to have broken. The resulting political scandal (Partygate), one of many controversies during Johnson's premiership, saw the Conservatives lose their poll lead.[11][12] These scandals culminated in the resignation of over 50 ministers from the Government following allegations of sexual misconduct against a government minister. Johnson resigned as prime minister in July 2022.[13] He resigned as an MP the following year,[14] after an investigation unanimously found that he had lied to Parliament.[15]\nLiz Truss won the resultant leadership election and succeeded Johnson in September.[16][17] Truss announced large-scale tax cuts and borrowing in a mini-budget on 23 September, although many of its measures were reversed following financial instability.[18] She resigned in October, making her the shortest-serving prime minister in British history,[19] and was succeeded unopposed by Rishi Sunak.[20]\nDuring his premiership, Sunak was credited with improving the economy and stabilising national politics following the premierships of his predecessors,[21] although many of his pledges and policy announcements ultimately went unfulfilled.[22][23] He did not avert further unpopularity for the Conservatives who, by the time of Sunak's election, had been in government for 12 years. Public opinion in favour of a change in government was reflected in the Conservatives' poor performance at the 2022, 2023 and 2024 local elections.[24]\nKeir Starmer won the Labour Party's 2020 leadership election, succeeding Jeremy Corbyn.[25] Under his leadership, Starmer repositioned the party away from the left and toward the political centre, and emphasised the elimination of antisemitism within the party.[26][27] Starmer's leading his party rightward in order to improve its electability has been widely compared to Tony Blair's development of New Labour in the 1990s. The political turmoil from the Conservative scandals and government crises led to Labour having a significant lead in polling over the Conservatives, often by very wide margins, since late 2021, coinciding with the start of the Partygate scandal.[11][12] Labour made gains in local elections: in the 2023 local elections, Labour gained more than 500 councillors and 22 councils, becoming the largest party in local government for the first time since 2002.[28]\nEd Davey, who previously served in the Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition, won the Liberal Democrats' 2020 leadership election, succeeding Jo Swinson, who lost her seat in the previous general election.[29] Davey prioritised defeating the Conservatives and ruled out working with them following the election.[30] The Liberal Democrats made gains in local elections: in the 2024 local elections, the Liberal Democrats finished second for the first time in a local election cycle since 2009.[31]\nLike the Conservatives, the Scottish National Party (SNP) suffered political turmoil and saw a decrease in their popularity in opinion polling, with multiple party leaders and First Ministers (Nicola Sturgeon, Humza Yousaf and John Swinney) and the Operation Branchform police investigation. Sturgeon claimed occupational burnout was the reason for her resignation,[32] while Yousaf resigned amid a government crisis following his termination of a power-sharing agreement with the Scottish Greens.[33] When Swinney assumed the leadership after being elected unopposed to succeed Yousaf, the SNP had been \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Ideologically adhering to liberalism ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nThe Liberal Democrats, colloquially known as the Lib Dems, is one of the major political parties in the United Kingdom. Ideologically adhering to liberalism, it was founded in 1988. The party is based at Liberal Democrat Headquarters, which since September 2025 has been based at Buckingham Gate,[1] in the Westminster area of Central London. The party's leader is Ed Davey. It is the third-largest party in the United Kingdom, with 72 members of Parliament (MPs) in the House of Commons. It has 75 members of the House of Lords,[7] 5 in the Scottish Parliament, 1 in the Welsh Senedd, and around 3,200 local council seats. The party holds a twice yearly Liberal Democrat Conference, at which policy is formulated. In contrast to its main opponents,[8][9][10] the Lib Dems grant all members attending Conference the right to vote on policy, under a one member, one vote system.[11][12] As well as voting in the Conference Hall, the party allows its members to vote online for its policies and leadership elections.[13] Members are also free to join organisations representing strands of party thinking, such as Liberal Reform and Social Liberal Forum, and for those under 30 years, Young Liberals.\nIn 1981, an electoral alliance was established between the Liberal Party, a group which descended from the 18th-century Whigs, and the Social Democratic Party (SDP), a splinter group from the Labour Party. In 1988, the parties merged as the Social and Liberal Democrats, adopting their present name a year later. Under the leaderships of Paddy Ashdown and Charles Kennedy, the party grew in the 1990s and 2000s, focusing its campaigns on specific seats and retained the third-largest party status in the House of Commons, although with significantly more seats than the predecessor Liberal Party. In the 1997 election, the Liberal Democrats doubled their seat count to 46.[14] In 2010, under Nick Clegg's leadership, the Lib Dems were junior partners in the Conservative-led coalition government, in which Clegg served as deputy prime minister. Though it allowed the party to implement some of its policies, the coalition damaged its electoral standing; it lost 48 of its 56 MPs at the 2015 general election, which relegated it to fourth-largest party in the House of Commons. Under the leaderships of Tim Farron, Vince Cable and Jo Swinson, the party refocused as a pro-Europeanist party opposing Brexit. In the 2019 general election, the party garnered 11.5% of the vote on an anti-Brexit platform, but this did not translate into seat gains.[15] However, the party's success was renewed under the leadership of Ed Davey, winning hundreds of councillors and 72 MPs in the 2024 general election, its highest result since 1923, and resuming its status as the third largest party in the House of Commons.\nA centrist[16] to centre-left[17] party, the Lib Dems ideologically draw upon liberalism and social democracy. Different factions have dominated the party at different times, each with its own ideological bent. Some factions leaned towards the centre-left, while others were in the centre. The party is a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party (ALDE), and Liberal International. It calls for constitutional reform, including a change from first-past-the-post voting to proportional representation. Emphasising stronger protections for civil liberties, the party promotes social-liberal approaches[18] to issues like LGBT rights, drug liberalisation, education and criminal justice. It favours a market-based economy supplemented with social welfare spending. The party has been described as progressive,[19][20][21] and is internationalist and pro-European,[22] and supported the People's Vote for UK membership of the European Union and greater European integration, having previously called for adoption of the euro. The Lib Dems have promoted further environmental protections and opposed British military ventures such as the Iraq War.\nThe Lib Dems have historically been strongest in northern Scotland, south-west London, South West England, and mid Wales. Membership is primarily made up of middle-class professionals and has a higher proportion of university-educated members than other UK parties.[not verified in body] The party is a federation of the English, Scottish, and Welsh Liberal Democrats, and is in a partnership with the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, while still organising there.\nThe Liberal Party had existed in different forms for over 300 years.[23] During the 19th and early 20th century, it had been one of the United Kingdom's two dominant political parties, along with the Conservative Party. Following World War I, it was pushed into third place by the Labour Party and underwent a gradual decline throughout the rest of the 20th century.[24] In the 1970s, the Liberal leader David Steel began contemplating how an alliance with other parties could return it to political power.[25] In 1977, he formed a pact with Labour Prime Minister James Callaghan to back Callaghan's government in a motion of no confidence. This angered many Liberals and damaged them electorally.[26] In the 1979 general election, the Liberals lost three seats in the House of Commons; the Conservatives, led by Margaret Thatcher, won the election.[27]\nWithin the Labour Party, many centrists were uncomfortable with the growing influence of the hard left, who were calling for the UK to leave the European Economic Community and unilaterally disarm as a nuclear power. In January 1981, four senior Labour MPs\u2014Bill Rodgers, Shirley Williams, Roy Jenkins, and David Owen, known as the \"Gang of Four\"\u2014issued the Limehouse Declaration in which they announced their split from Labour. This led to the formal launch of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in March.[28] One of its first decisions was to negotiate an electoral arrangement with the Liberals, facilitated between Jenkins, who was the first SDP leader, and Steel.[29]\nThe new alliance initially did well in\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Ideologically adhering to liberalism, it was founded in 1988. The party is based at Liberal Democrat Headquarters, which since September 2025 has been based at Buckingham Gate,[1] in the Westminster area of Central London. The party's leader is Ed Davey. It is the third-largest party in the United Kingdom, with 72 members of Parliament (MPs) in the House of Commons. It has 75 members of the House of Lords,[7] 5 in the Scottish Parliament, 1 in the Welsh Senedd, and around 3,200 local council seats. The party holds a twice yearly Liberal Democrat Conference, at which policy is formulated. In contrast to its main opponents,[8][9][10] the Lib Dems grant all members attending Conference the right to vote on policy, under a one member, one vote system.[11][12] As well as voting in the Conference Hall, the party allows its members to vote online for its policies and leadership elections.[13] Members are also free to join organisations representing strands of party thinking, such as Liberal Reform and Social Liberal Forum, and for those under 30 years, Young Liberals.\nIn 1981, an electoral alliance was established between the Liberal Party, a group which descended from the 18th-century Whigs, and the Social Democratic Party (SDP), a splinter group from the Labour Party. In 1988, the parties merged as the Social and Liberal Democrats, adopting their present name a year later. Under the leaderships of Paddy Ashdown and Charles Kennedy, the party grew in the 1990s and 2000s, focusing its campaigns on specific seats and retained the third-largest party status in the House of Commons, although with significantly more seats than the predecessor Liberal Party. In the 1997 election, the Liberal Democrats doubled their seat count to 46.[14] In 2010, under Nick Clegg's leadership, the Lib Dems were junior partners in the Conservative-led coalition government, in which Clegg served as deputy prime minister. Though it allowed the party to implement some of its policies, the coalition damaged its electoral standing; it lost 48 of its 56 MPs at the 2015 general election, which relegated it to fourth-largest party in the House of Commons. Under the leaderships of Tim Farron, Vince Cable and Jo Swinson, the party refocused as a pro-Europeanist party opposing Brexit. In the 2019 general election, the party garnered 11.5% of the vote on an anti-Brexit platform, but this did not translate into seat gains.[15] However, the party's success was renewed under the leadership of Ed Davey, winning hundreds of councillors and 72 MPs in the 2024 general election, its highest result since 1923, and resuming its status as the third largest party in the House of Commons.\nA centrist[16] to centre-left[17] party, the Lib Dems ideologically draw upon liberalism and social democracy. Different factions have dominated the party at different times, each with its own ideological bent. Some factions leaned towards the centre-left, while others were in the centre. The party is a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party (ALDE), and Liberal International. It calls for constitutional reform, including a change from first-past-the-post voting to proportional representation. Emphasising stronger protections for civil liberties, the party promotes social-liberal approaches[18] to issues like LGBT rights, drug liberalisation, education and criminal justice. It favours a market-based economy supplemented with social welfare spending. The party has been described as progressive,[19][20][21] and is internationalist and pro-European,[22] and supported the People's Vote for UK membership of the European Union and greater European integration, having previously called for adoption of the euro. The Lib Dems have promoted further environmental protections and opposed British military ventures such as the Iraq War.\nThe Lib Dems have historically been strongest in northern Scotland, south-west London, South West England, and mid Wales. Membership is primarily made up of middle-class professionals and has a higher proportion of university-educated members than other UK parties.[not verified in body] The party is a federation of the English, Scottish, and Welsh Liberal Democrats, and is in a partnership with the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, while still organising there.\nThe Liberal Party had existed in different forms for over 300 years.[23] During the 19th and early 20th century, it had been one of the United Kingdom's two dominant political parties, along with the Conservative Party. Following World War I, it was pushed into third place by the Labour Party and underwent a gradual decline throughout the rest of the 20th century.[24] In the 1970s, the Liberal leader David Steel began contemplating how an alliance with other parties could return it to political power.[25] In 1977, he formed a pact with Labour Prime Minister James Callaghan to back Callaghan's government in a motion of no confidence. This angered many Liberals and damaged them electorally.[26] In the 1979 general election, the Liberals lost three seats in the House of Commons; the Conservatives, led by Margaret Thatcher, won the election.[27]\nWithin the Labour Party, many centrists were uncomfortable with the growing influence of the hard left, who were calling for the UK to leave the European Economic Community and unilaterally disarm as a nuclear power. In January 1981, four senior Labour MPs\u2014Bill Rodgers, Shirley Williams, Roy Jenkins, and David Owen, known as the \"Gang of Four\"\u2014issued the Limehouse Declaration in which they announced their split from Labour.
