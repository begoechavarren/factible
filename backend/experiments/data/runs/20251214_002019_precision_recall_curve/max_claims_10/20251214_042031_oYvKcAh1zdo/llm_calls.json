    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\n\u201cGive me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free\u2026\u201d These poetic lines, engraved on a bronze plaque beneath the Statue of Liberty, speak to who we are: a nation of immigrants. Until now . . . As Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer lamented, \u201cTears are running down the cheeks of the Statue of Liberty.\u201d We\u2019ve turned our backs on those huddled masses. Closed our borders. Separated families. Hardened our hearts. Or so you would think if you only read the headlines or watch TV news. Just one problem: It\u2019s not true. The United States still maintains the most generous immigration policies in the world. Generous to a fault...because the overwhelming numbers have stymied our ability to assimilate the huddled masses. 50 million residents of America are foreign-born. In fact, today the United States has more immigrants as a percentage of its total population than at any time since 1890. That\u2019s why, to give one illustration, 176 different languages are spoken among students in the New York City school system. How did we get here? For starters, America grants permanent residence to a million people every single year. And that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg because of something you\u2019ve probably heard referred to as \u201cchain migration.\u201d Chain migration allows immigrants to sponsor not only their immediate family\u2014parents, spouses and children under age 21, but much of their extended family once they gain citizenship: unmarried adult children and any children they might have, married adult children and their children, and brothers and sisters and their children. Princeton University researchers, using the most recently available data, found that immigrants sponsored an average of 3.45 additional relatives each. So, the one million immigrants granted permanent residence each year potentially adds, over time, another three and a half million. In addition, an estimated 100,000 refugees and asylum-seekers\u2014people who claim to be fleeing political or personal strife abroad\u2014enter the country annually. From 2008 to 2017, the U.S. gave green cards to well over a million people for humanitarian reasons, allowing them to live and work here permanently. After five years, they can apply for full citizenship. We\u2019re not done yet. In that same time frame, nearly half a million more people came to America through the diversity visa lottery\u2014a program designed to admit more people from \u201cunderrepresented\u201d countries into the U.S. Diversity visa applicants don't need a high school education, job skills \u2014or pretty much anything. And, thanks again to chain migration, spouses and unmarried children under 21 of visa lottery winners also get to come to America. This non-stop flow of new legal immigrants\u2014based on family ties instead of skills, abilities, and allegiance to American values\u2014has, of course, been supplemented by millions who enter the country illegally and stay illegally. Dominant media outlets use the euphemism \u201cundocumented,\u201d but the official U.S. government term used in federal statutes is \u201cillegal alien\u201d: an unlawful entrant who came without permission and stays in open defiance of our laws. The number of illegal aliens in the country is usually given as 11 million, but have you noticed that number never seems to change? Common sense suggests it\u2019s higher\u2014much higher. And though illegal aliens themselves don\u2019t qualify for welfare, they receive free health care in our clinics and hospitals, and through their American-born children they can expect to receive all manner of benefits\u2014cash aid, food stamps, and housing vouchers. Their children are entitled to a free education in public schools. Building a high-tech border barrier would certainly help stem this flow. Ending chain migration is another obvious remedy. E-Verify, the national database that allows employers to check workers\u2019 immigration status, is also essential. So is a fully-functioning entry-exit system to track visa overstayers. But all solutions will ultimately fail unless we get control of the numbers and enforce our laws consistently. It\u2019s Sovereignty 101: This is our home and we have not only the right, but the responsibility, to determine who comes in, how many come in, and what qualities and qualifications they bring. The truth is, we let in millions. And, of course, millions more want to come. Who can blame them? But it\u2019s simply not possible or desirable to let in everyone. And it\u2019s not hateful to say so. It\u2019s not hateful to protect our borders. It\u2019s not hateful to protect our citizens. It\u2019s not hateful to protect our values. Lady Liberty may be shedding tears\u2014not because we\u2019ve stopped welcoming immigrants, but because our ill-conceived immigration policies are threatening the American Dream.

In the ensuing months, however, more immigrants left the country or were deported than arrived. By June, the country\u2019s foreign-born population had shrunk by more than a million people, marking its first decline since the 1960s.\nA new Pew Research Center analysis of Census Bureau data finds that, as of June 2025:\nStarting in mid-2024, several policy changes have affected the U.S. immigrant population:\nPew Research Center regularly publishes research on the U.S. immigrant population and international migration trends. Here are answers to some key questions about U.S. immigrants, based on the most recent detailed data available. (In some cases, this data is from mid-2023.)\nAs of June 2025, 51.9 million immigrants lived in the U.S., making up 15.4% of the nation\u2019s population. This was down from January, when there were a record 53.3 million immigrants in the U.S., accounting for 15.8% of the country\u2019s population \u2013 the highest percentage on record.\nEven as the nation\u2019s immigrant population has declined in recent months \u2013 a change that may be partly artificial due to a declining survey response rate among immigrants \u2013 the U.S. is home to more immigrants than any other country.\nAs of 2024, the second-largest immigrant population is in Germany, numbering around 17 million, according to the latest estimates from the United Nations.\nWhile the U.S. is home to the largest number of immigrants, dozens of countries (including Germany) have a higher proportion of immigrants in their populations than the U.S. does. In neighboring Canada, for example, immigrants account for 22% of the population. And in the United Arab Emirates, about three-quarters of all residents were born elsewhere.\nAs of mid-2023 \u2013 the latest year for which detailed data is available \u2013 more than 11 million U.S. residents were born in Mexico, representing 22% of all immigrants nationally. The second-largest immigrant group was from India (3.2 million, or 6%), followed by China (3 million, or 6%), the Philippines (2.1 million, or 4%) and Cuba (1.7 million, or 3%).\nAbout half of all U.S. immigrants (52%, or 26.7 million people) were born in Latin America. In addition to the millions of migrants from Mexico and Cuba, more than a million hail from El Salvador (1.6 million), Guatemala (1.4 million), the Dominican Republic (1.4 million), Colombia (1.2 million), Honduras (1.1 million) and Venezuela (1.1 million).\nAfter Latin America, Asia is the second-largest region of birth for U.S. immigrants. In 2023, around a quarter of all immigrants (27%, or nearly 14 million people) were born in Asia.\nAs of 2023, there were about 11 million immigrants from every other world region combined, accounting for 22% of the U.S. foreign-born population: 10% were born in Europe, 5% in sub-Saharan Africa, 4% in the Middle East-North Africa region, and 2% in Canada or another North American country (a category that includes Bermuda and some smaller countries).\nAn unprecedented number of immigrants \u2013 more than 11 million \u2013 arrived in the U.S. between 2020 and 2025. That included more than 3 million in 2023 alone, the largest annual total ever recorded, according to a Center analysis of government data sources.\nAlongside this increase, immigrants\u2019 origin regions have also shifted, with a growing share coming from South America and Europe and a declining share coming from Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.\nBetween 2021 and 2023, 20% of newly arrived immigrants were from South America, up from 13% in the period between 2015 and 2019. Another 12% of new arrivals between 2021 and 2023 were from Europe or Canada, up from 9% in the earlier period.\nAt the same time, 24% of new arrivals between 2021 and 2023 were from South and East Asia, down from 29% in 2015-19. And 5% of new arrivals between 2021 and 2023 involved people from sub-Saharan Africa, down from 8% in 2015-19.\nMexico was the largest origin country for immigrants who arrived between 2021 and 2023. About 11% of immigrants who came to the U.S. during this period were born in Mexico. Rounding out the top five countries of origin for immigrants who arrived during this period were India (8%), Venezuela (7%), Cuba (6%) and Colombia (5%).\nThroughout this period, unauthorized immigrants accounted for most new immigrant arrivals, with many coming from Central and South America.\nSince 1965, more than 76 million immigrants have come to the U.S.\nBefore then, U.S. immigration law favored immigrants from Northern and Western Europe and mostly barred immigration from Asia. The 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act opened up immigration from Asia and Latin America. The Immigration Act of 1990 further increased legal immigration and allowed immigrants from more countries to enter the U.S. legally.\nImmigration flows after 1965 have been larger and come from different and more countries than earlier flows:\nToday, Mexico remains the largest origin country among U.S. immigrants. However, immigration from Mexico has slowed since 2007, and the Mexican-born population in the U.S. has since dropped. The Mexican share of the U.S. immigrant population declined from 29% in 2010 to 22% in 2023.\nAs of 2023, 46% of immigrants were naturalized U.S. citizens. Nearly a quarter (23%) were lawful permanent residents, often referred to as \u201cgreen card holders,\u201d and another 4% were lawful temporary residents who were permitted to stay in the U.S. for a limited period of time, usually for work or study.

In the ensuing months, however, more immigrants left the country or were deported than arrived. By June, the country\u2019s foreign-born population had shrunk by more than a million people, marking its first decline since the 1960s.\nA new Pew Research Center analysis of Census Bureau data finds that, as of June 2025:\nStarting in mid-2024, several policy changes have affected the U.S. immigrant population:\nPew Research Center regularly publishes research on the U.S. immigrant population and international migration trends. Here are answers to some key questions about U.S. immigrants, based on the most recent detailed data available. (In some cases, this data is from mid-2023.)\nAs of June 2025, 51.9 million immigrants lived in the U.S., making up 15.4% of the nation\u2019s population. This was down from January, when there were a record 53.3 million immigrants in the U.S., accounting for 15.8% of the country\u2019s population \u2013 the highest percentage on record.\nEven as the nation\u2019s immigrant population has declined in recent months \u2013 a change that may be partly artificial due to a declining survey response rate among immigrants \u2013 the U.S. is home to more immigrants than any other country.\nAs of 2024, the second-largest immigrant population is in Germany, numbering around 17 million, according to the latest estimates from the United Nations.\nWhile the U.S. is home to the largest number of immigrants, dozens of countries (including Germany) have a higher proportion of immigrants in their populations than the U.S. does. In neighboring Canada, for example, immigrants account for 22% of the population. And in the United Arab Emirates, about three-quarters of all residents were born elsewhere.\nAs of mid-2023 \u2013 the latest year for which detailed data is available \u2013 more than 11 million U.S. residents were born in Mexico, representing 22% of all immigrants nationally. The second-largest immigrant group was from India (3.2 million, or 6%), followed by China (3 million, or 6%), the Philippines (2.1 million, or 4%) and Cuba (1.7 million, or 3%).\nAbout half of all U.S. immigrants (52%, or 26.7 million people) were born in Latin America. In addition to the millions of migrants from Mexico and Cuba, more than a million hail from El Salvador (1.6 million), Guatemala (1.4 million), the Dominican Republic (1.4 million), Colombia (1.2 million), Honduras (1.1 million) and Venezuela (1.1 million).\nAfter Latin America, Asia is the second-largest region of birth for U.S. immigrants. In 2023, around a quarter of all immigrants (27%, or nearly 14 million people) were born in Asia.\nAs of 2023, there were about 11 million immigrants from every other world region combined, accounting for 22% of the U.S. foreign-born population: 10% were born in Europe, 5% in sub-Saharan Africa, 4% in the Middle East-North Africa region, and 2% in Canada or another North American country (a category that includes Bermuda and some smaller countries).\nAn unprecedented number of immigrants \u2013 more than 11 million \u2013 arrived in the U.S. between 2020 and 2025. That included more than 3 million in 2023 alone, the largest annual total ever recorded, according to a Center analysis of government data sources.\nAlongside this increase, immigrants\u2019 origin regions have also shifted, with a growing share coming from South America and Europe and a declining share coming from Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.\nBetween 2021 and 2023, 20% of newly arrived immigrants were from South America, up from 13% in the period between 2015 and 2019. Another 12% of new arrivals between 2021 and 2023 were from Europe or Canada, up from 9% in the earlier period.\nAt the same time, 24% of new arrivals between 2021 and 2023 were from South and East Asia, down from 29% in 2015-19. And 5% of new arrivals between 2021 and 2023 involved people from sub-Saharan Africa, down from 8% in 2015-19.\nMexico was the largest origin country for immigrants who arrived between 2021 and 2023. About 11% of immigrants who came to the U.S. during this period were born in Mexico. Rounding out the top five countries of origin for immigrants who arrived during this period were India (8%), Venezuela (7%), Cuba (6%) and Colombia (5%).\nThroughout this period, unauthorized immigrants accounted for most new immigrant arrivals, with many coming from Central and South America.\nSince 1965, more than 76 million immigrants have come to the U.S.\nBefore then, U.S. immigration law favored immigrants from Northern and Western Europe and mostly barred immigration from Asia. The 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act opened up immigration from Asia and Latin America. The Immigration Act of 1990 further increased legal immigration and allowed immigrants from more countries to enter the U.S. legally.\nImmigration flows after 1965 have been larger and come from different and more countries than earlier flows:\nToday, Mexico remains the largest origin country among U.S. immigrants. However, immigration from Mexico has slowed since 2007, and the Mexican-born population in the U.S. has since dropped. The Mexican share of the U.S. immigrant population declined from 29% in 2010 to 22% in 2023.\nAs of 2023, 46% of immigrants were naturalized U.S. citizens. Nearly a quarter (23%) were lawful permanent residents, often referred to as \u201cgreen card holders,\u201d and another 4% were lawful temporary residents who were permitted to stay in the U.S. for a limited period of time, usually for work or study. The remaining immigrants in the U.S. fell into the \u201cunauthorized\u201d category and constituted 27% of all U.S. immigrants.\nRelated: U.S. Unauthorized Immigrant Population Reached a Record 14 Million in 2023\nUnauthorized immigrants are those without full legal status.

SO EXCITING! Our Great American Companies can finally keep their invaluable Talent.\"\nFor a $5 million contribution, foreign high-rollers can now also avail of a \"Platinum Card,\" which comes with the ability to spend up to 270 days in the U.S. without being subject to U.S. taxes on non-U.S. income.\nThe first step to apply requires a non-refundable $15,000 processing fee to the Department of Homeland Security. The applicants will then be vetted and approved by the DHS and following a $1 million donation can expect to receive U.S. residency in \"record time,\" according to the website.\nThere\u2019s also a remedy for corporations looking to procure foreign talent. But that would require a $2 million gift. While Trump has defended H-1B visas, which corporations utilize to bring in foreign skilled workers, he's made it harder for companies by increasing the application cost to $100,000. But his defense of the program has drawn ire from his MAGA base.\nFor an individual applicant or corporate sponsor looking to sponsor a spouse or unmarried children under the age of 21, they'd be required to pay an additional $15,000 DHS processing fee and $1 million gift per person, according to the site, which accepts the fees online.\nA family of four would be looking at shelling out north of $4.6 million.\nTrump has said that he is not seeking approval from Congress as he is not providing gold card buyers with citizenship \u2013 only a path to citizenship.\nOther countries also have immigration programs that offer permanent residency or citizenship to foreign investors in exchange for investment. Portugal, for example, offers residency and a path to EU citizenship after five years.\nWhen he first floated the idea in February, Trump said the card would replace the \"EB-5\" immigrant investor green card visa program. However, according to the website, the immigrants coming on the new gold card would be on an EB-1 or EB-2 visa, which are employment-based visas for highly skilled professionals with advanced degrees or exceptional ability in a particular field.\n\"A $1 million gift upon completion of the individual\u2019s vetting is evidence that the individual will substantially benefit the United States,\" the site says.\nThe EB-5 visa allows immigrant investors the option to invest between $800,000 and $1.05 million to obtain a green card. The investment money is used to help create or preserve U.S. jobs. And at some point, the investment is also something the immigrant can claim back. However, the program currently has long wait times and country caps.\nThe new $1 million Trump Gold Card is a donation, with no indication of any of the money ever going back to the people buying it.\n\"Wealthy people will be coming into our country by buying this card,\" Trump said in February when he first introduced the concept. \"They'll be wealthy, and they'll be successful, and they'll be spending a lot of money, and paying a lot of taxes and employing a lot of people.\"\nSwapna Venugopal Ramaswamy is a White House correspondent for USA TODAY.
