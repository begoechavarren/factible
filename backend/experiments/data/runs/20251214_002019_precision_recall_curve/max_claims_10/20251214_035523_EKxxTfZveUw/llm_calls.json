    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nsomething happened this month that I want to make sure that people do not miss Donald Trump posted on Truth social this document it is a 32-page document containing all the latest information about what has been exposed about fraud in the 2020 election we're going to walk through this document this week on wolves and [Music] finance I need to start this video with a disclaimer YouTube policy does not allow you to say in videos that the certified results of elections were wrong so in keeping with this policy I will not be saying in this video whether Donald Trump did or did not win the 2020 election instead I'm going to be laying out all the facts and I'll let you decide for yourselves what I want you to do is watch this video all the way to the end and then leave a comment down below letting me know what you think do you think the 2020 election was stolen let me know in the comments below it's important to understand the context of President Trump's post he is currently facing a criminal Rico trial in Fulton County Georgia because he questioned the results of the 2020 election the case is based on a bizarre legal theory that Donald Trump knew that he lost the election but lied about it and committed fraud by trying to convince everyone that he actually won so the key question in the case was whether Donald Trump was lying when he claimed he won the 2020 election the district attorney bringing the case against Donald Trump is Fanny Willis it was revealed in a court filing this week that Fanny Willis has been sleeping with the special prosecutor she hired to handle the case against Trump the special prosecutor is named Nathan Wade and he has never filed a RICO case Fanny Willis has paid Nathan Wade more than $650,000 while they were sleeping together Fanny Willis has other attorneys working in her office with experience in Rico cases why in the world would she pay someone $650,000 who has no experience it turns out they would then use the money to pay for trips to places like the Caribbean this looks like obvious corruption and there is currently a motion filed to dismiss let's go back to when the case was first filed when President Trump was first arrested by Fanny Willis in August he announced that he was going to release a 100-page report containing evidence of fraud in the 2020 election that would prove the election was stolen he claimed it was a conclusive report and that all charges should be dropped against me and others now at the time he never released that report saying that his legal counsel wanted him to wait until trial I believe this new report that was just released this month is part of the president's conclusive report so what is in this new report it goes through all the swing states in the 2020 election for each state it gives a list of bullet points with evidence of fraud in the election each one of the bullet points comes with citations to sources backing up these claims this is important to understand these are not just random statements of fact the bullet points are backed up by detailed investigations which you can then read to get even more information now I'm not going to go through all the information in this report because there is a lot I'm going to review some of the more shocking highlights here is a list of all the swing states with the vote differences each of these states was called for Joe Biden some by very narrow margins Donald Trump only needed to win three of these states and he would have won the election the report argues that Donald Trump actually won all of these five states Georgia Wisconsin Pennsylvania Arizona and Michigan let's start with Georgia in my opinion this is the most obvious case of fraud it was reported that Trump lost Georgia by 11,779 votes in fton County we have video evidence of a poll worker named Ruby Freeman running the same stack of ballots through the counting machines multiple times ironically Ruby Freeman was later given the presidential citizens medal by Joe Biden for her work during the 2020 election Ruby Freeman has sued Rudy Giuliani for defamation in a Washington DC court and last month a mostly Democrat jury awarded Ruby Freeman a 100 $50 million verdict against Rudy Giuliani in the complaint Ruby Freeman explains that she did not like that Rudy Giuliani talked about the video of her and that Rudy Giuliani falsely accused her of counting the same ballots multiple times among other things she claims that since the election results were certified as correct that any statement made by Rudy Giuliani is false Rudy Giuliani was not allowed during the trial to submit one piece of evidence to the court now can someone please explain this to me how can there be a fair trial if the judge does not allow the defense to present any evidence that doesn't seem very fair to me there are some other unusual things about this case how is this case being tried in Washington DC Ruby Freeman is in Fulton County Georgia Rudy giuliani's comments were that she engaged Ed in election fraud in fton County Georgia why is this in Washington DC in the complaint Ruby Freeman explains that Rudy giuliani's comments were broadcast over the oan news channel which has an office in Washington DC Rudy Giuliani also worked in Washington DC as Donald Trump's lawyer so for that reason the case went to trial in Washington DC in front of a mostly Democrat jury Rudy Giuliani has already said that he plans to appeal the verdict it should be noted that Ruby Freeman's complaint states that this video does not show her committing illegal ballot counting but we can see with our own eyes that she counts the same stack of ballots multiple times what should we choose to believe her own statement or the video that we can see with our own eyes what do you think the problem with Ruby Freeman's statements is that the evidence provides a lot of doubt in the report from president trump it states fton county certified 59,4 in-person votes on Election Day despite the fact that only 14,522 evidence suggests the in-person vote total on Election Day was inflated by approximately 30 7,000 votes somehow a whole lot of votes came out of nowhere from people who did not exist could this have come from poll workers counting the same ballots multiple times remember that the vote difference in Georgia was only 11,779 votes and we are talking about a potential 37,000 fake ballots another issue in Georgia was the mail in ballots it's much easier to cheat with mail and ballots because anyone can drop it off in the mail you are relying on the people counting the votes like Ruby Freeman to do the honest thing and verify that the ballot is accurate before they count it well it turns out that in Georgia likely 67,2 184 votes were cast from voters with invalid residency these were people who did not actually live in Georgia but had their vote counted anyway remember remember the vote difference in Georgia was only 11,779 votes and just this issue alone would be 67,2 184 illegal votes there are many more bullet points about issues in the Georgia elections but I think you get the point there is a lot of evidence of election fraud in Georgia specifically in fton County so it is odd that fton county is the place that is criminally prosecuting Donald Trump for asking questions about the election it also seems like Fanny Willis is attempting to cover something up the next state is Wisconsin the vote difference was 20,625 an exception that you could vote by mail without having to show your ID this resulted in 220,00 44 votes cast from individuals who were Exempted from showing voter ID that would be incredibly easy to cheat if you never had to show an ID we are talking about a vote difference of 20,625 votes were cast without an ID this this problem really shows itself when we look at nursing homes nursing homes in Milwaukee Dayne and Racine counties had 100% turnout so you're telling me that 100% of people in nursing homes voted some people in nursing homes are nearing death so even people who were literally on their deathbeds got up and voted something just doesn't sound right to me about that in one example Merill Barrett who was 104 years old and did not recognize her own children had a ballot cast in her name in the 2020 presidential election okay now how obvious do we have to get that some funny business is going on again there are many more bullet points about issues in Wisconsin but I think you get the point the next state is Pennsylvania the vote difference in Pennsylvania was 8,555 votes now now that sounds like a lot until you find out that there were 121,50 more votes than voters Pennsylvania uses a voting system called sure the Statewide uniform registry of electors they were never able to reconcile the number of votes that were counted with the number of people who were registered to vote so the vote difference was 8,555 votes and there were 121 , 240 more votes than voters this is another example where there are many more bullet points in the report but this one fact alone raises a lot of questions for me the next state is Arizona this is the closest vote margin with only 10,457 votes Arizona did some of the most blatantly illegal things I don't know if you remember this but Arizona took a really long time to count their ballots the election took place on November 3rd well they didn't finish counting the ballots until November 30th well it turns out they were accepting and Counting ballots after the election day these were illegal votes here's a quote from the report Maricopa County accepted 20,500 mailin ballots after election day by law ballots must be received no later than 700 p.m. on Election Day which was November 3rd so the election was over the deadline was passed and they were still receiving and Counting ballots days after the election was over these are illegal votes the vote margin was 10,457 votes this one example accounts for 20,500 ballots what makes matters worse is that the meropa County elections Department withheld this information from public records requests for for 7 months after the elections no one knew this was going on until it was too late to protest the election this looks a lot like cheating also just like in the other states it looks like some of the votes were completely made up two precincts in Puma County had over 100% turnout for mailin ballots can someone in the comments please explain to me how this can happen because I'm really having a hard time understanding this how is it possible to have more than 100% of people vote how is that possible what is even more suspicious is the Arizona Secretary of State during the 2020 election was someone named Katie Hobbs she is the person responsible for running the election it turns out 2 years later she somehow became the governor of Arizona in 2022 she ran against car Lake Katie Hobbs miraculously won against all polling predictions and Katie Hobbs certified her own election count naming herself the winner ktie hobb's election is still being contested in the courts with Arizona there are many more bullet points in president Trump's report but I think you get the point the next state is Michigan the vote difference is votes now this is the largest vote difference out of the Swing States and it sounds like a lot until you find out that Michigan has 271,000 delivered in a van at 3:30 a.m. past the 8:00 p.m. deadline this was 50 boxes of ballots each containing thousands of ballots how can they count ballots that were received after the deadline when we look at the ballot counts we can see the spike that came from the suspicious ballots Michigan was also the state where we now know there was a police investigation of a company called GB bi strategies the police raided a gbi strategies office to find thousands of fraudulent voter registrations the forms were in the same handwriting and used fake addresses gbi strategies was funded by a super pack called black pack which paid the firm 11,254 n19 to register voters for Joe Biden in 2020 these people were not only only under investigation for cheating during the election they were making an awful lot of money doing it again there are many more bullet points in the report but I think you get the point so that was the report that was posted by President Trump going through the five swing states in the 2020 election again I'm not going to say whether the election was or was not stolen I want you to decide what do you think was the 2020 election stolen let me know in the comments down below and if you like this video don't forget to hit that

Wade has faced heightened ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nWASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013 Today, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-OH) sent a letter to Nathan Wade, an associate of Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, demanding documents and information about the coordination of the Fulton County District Attorney's Office (FCDAO) with other politically motivated investigations and the potential misuse of federal funds. Although Fani Willis has so far refused to cooperate with the Committee's oversight, invoices that Nathan Wade submitted for payment by the FCDAO, and made public as part of a court filing, highlight this collusion.\nExcerpts of the Letter to Nathan Wade: \"The Committee on the Judiciary continues to conduct oversight of politically motivated prosecutions by state and local officials. Based on recent reports, we believe that you possess documents and information about the coordination of the Fulton County District Attorney's Office (FCDAO) with other politically motivated investigations and prosecutions and the potential misuse of federal funds. Accordingly, we ask for your cooperation with our oversight. \"On August 14, 2023, with your assistance, Fulton County District Attorney Fani T. Willis indicted a former President of the United States and current declared candidate for that office. According to a recent court filing, you have been paid more than $650,000\u2014at the rate of $250 per hour\u2014to serve as an 'Attorney Consultant' and later a 'Special Assistant District Attorney' in the unprecedented investigation and prosecution of the former President and other former federal officials. This filing also alleges that while receiving a substantial amount of money from Fulton County, you spent extravagantly on lavish vacations with your boss, Ms. Willis. \"Although Ms. Willis has so far refused to cooperate with our oversight of the FCDAO\u2019s coordination with other politically motivated prosecutions, invoices that you submitted for payment by the FCDAO, and made public as part of this court filing, highlight this collusion. This new information appears to substantiate our concerns that Ms. Willis's politicized prosecution, including the decision to convene a special purpose grand jury, was aided by partisan Democrats in Washington, D.C. For example:\n\"The FCDAO reportedly compensated you using a concoction of comingled funds, including monies confiscated or seized by the FCDAO and monies directed from Fulton County's 'general' fund. The Committee has information that the FCDAO received approximately $14.6 million in grant funds from the Department of Justice between 2020 and 2023 and, given the enormous legal fees you have billed to the FCDAO, there are open questions about whether federal funds were used by the FCDAO to finance your prosecution. In fact, on one day\u2014November 5, 2021\u2014you billed taxpayers for 24 hours of legal work, attesting that you worked all day and night without break on a politically motivated prosecution. \"A recent news report corroborates your coordination with partisan Democrats, explaining that you and FCDAO staff 'quietly met' with the partisan January 6 Committee, which allowed you to review information they had gathered. Politico reported that the partisan January 6 Committee provided Ms. Willis's prosecution a 'boost' as she prepared to convene a special grand jury and even 'helped prosecutors prepare for interviews with key witnesses.' The same article suggests that the partisan January 6 Committee provided you access to records it withheld from other law-enforcement entities and even other Members of Congress.\n\"The Committee has serious concerns about the degree of improper coordination among politicized actors\u2014including the Biden White House\u2014to investigate and prosecute President Biden's chief political opponent. This new information released recently only reinforces the Committee's concerns about politically motivated prosecutions by state and local officials. To advance our oversight, we ask that you please produce the following documents and information for the period of November 1, 2021, to the present: 1. All documents and communications in your possession between or among the Fulton County District Attorney's Office, including yourself, and the U.S. Department of Justice and its components, including but not limited to Special Counsel Jack Smith, referring or relating to the Fulton County District Attorney's Office's investigation of President Trump; 2. All documents and communications in your possession between or among the Fulton County District Attorney's Office, including yourself, and the Executive Office of the President, including but not limited to the White House Counsel's Office, referring or relating to the Fulton County District Attorney's Office's investigation of President Trump; 3. All documents and communications in your possession between or among the Fulton County District Attorney\u2019s Office, including yourself, and the partisan January 6 Select Committee referring or relating to the Fulton County District Attorney's Office's investigation of President Trump; 4. All notes, memoranda, documents, or other material in your possession referring or relating to your meetings, conferences, phone calls, or other interactions with the U.S. Department of Justice, the Executive Office of the President, or the partisan January 6 Select Committee; 5. All invoices, including credit card statements and individualized reimbursement requests, submitted by you or your law partners to the Fulton County District Attorney's Office relating to its investigation of President Trump; and 6. All contracts and financial arrangements between you and the Fulton County District Attorney's Office relating to its investigation of President Trump.\" Read the full letter to Nathan Wade here.\nDemocratic Site\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Donald J. Trump, et al. was a criminal case against Donald Trump, the 45th and eventually-47th president of the United States, and 18 co-defendants. All defendants were charged with one count of violating Georgia's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statute, which would have had a penalty of 5\u201320 years in prison. The indictment came in the context of Trump's broader effort to overturn his loss in the 2020 presidential election. The case was one of four criminal indictments against Trump, all charged in 2023.\nDefendants were variously charged with 40 additional counts from other allegations, including: Trump and co-defendants plotted to create pro-Trump slates of fake electors;[1] Trump called the Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, asking him to \"find 11,780 votes\", which would have reversed his loss in the state by a single vote margin;[2] and a small group of Trump allies in Coffee County illegally accessed voting systems attempting to find evidence of election fraud.[3]\nFollowing an investigation launched in February 2021 by Fulton County district attorney Fani Willis, a grand jury of 23 citizens handed up the indictments on August 14, 2023.[4] Her prosecution alleged that Trump led a \"criminal racketeering enterprise\", in which he and all other defendants \"knowingly and willfully joined a conspiracy to unlawfully change the outcome\" of the 2020 U.S. presidential election in Georgia.\nThe case was set to be heard in the Fulton County Superior Court with judge Scott F. McAfee presiding.[5] Former Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows, former Department of Justice (DOJ) official Jeffrey Clark, and three other defendants unsuccessfully sought to have their cases removed to federal court.[6] Four defendants pleaded guilty to some charges, agreed to cooperate with the prosecution, and received sentences including probation, fines, and making public apologies.[7]\nAfter pausing the case,[8] the Georgia Court of Appeals in December 2024 disqualified Willis from prosecuting it.[9] In November 2025, Pete Skandalakis, executive director of the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia, took on the role of prosecutor.[10] Less than two weeks later, on November 26, he dropped all charges against all remaining defendants, ending the case.[11][12]\nWeeks before the 2016 presidential election, Trump claimed through a series of tweets that widespread voter fraud was imminent, a sentiment echoed by his legal advisor, Rudy Giuliani.[13] Trump repeated the accusations throughout his presidency and into his 2020 reelection campaign; for months, he prepared arguments in the event of his loss, primarily relating to mail-in ballots.[14] As early as August 2020, he enlisted conservative activist and lawyer Cleta Mitchell to help overturn the election.[15] Two days before Election Day (November 3, 2020), he told reporters that he would be \"going in with [his] lawyers\" as soon as the election was over.[16]\nOn Election Day, preliminary surveys at polling places showed Trump in the lead as his supporters were more likely to turn out in person amid the COVID-19 pandemic, but his lead diminished as mail-in ballots were counted.[17] At the behest of Giuliani, Trump declared in a 2 a.m. election night speech in the East Room that he had won the election and that the counts being reported were fraudulent.[18] As ballots were being counted, campaign data expert Matt Oczkowski bluntly informed Trump that he was going to lose the election. White House Counsel Pat Cipollone told him that invalidating the results of the election would be a \"murder-suicide pact\".[19] Under then-attorney general William Barr, the Department of Justice failed to find widespread voter fraud in the election.[20]\nFormer speaker of the House Newt Gingrich predicted that Trump voters would erupt in \"rage\",[21] a sentiment shared by House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, who told Laura Ingraham on The Ingraham Angle that Republicans should \"not be silent about this\".[22]\nOn December 3, 2020, a 7-hour hearing of the Georgia Senate Committee on the Judiciary heard Trump's legal team, including Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman, made false claims alleging fraud and misconduct in the state's election process, and that the Georgia legislature had the power to appoint electors for Trump.[23][24] A similar presentation was made to the Georgia House of Representatives Committee on Governmental Relations.\nOn December 7, Trump called Georgia House Speaker David Ralston asking him to convene a special session of the state legislature to overturn the Georgia election results.[25]\nIn late December 2020 and early January 2021, Jeffrey Clark, the Assistant Attorney General for the Environment and Natural Resources Division and acting for the DOJ Civil Division, drafted a letter to Georgia officials stating the DOJ had \"identified significant concerns that may have impacted the outcome of the election in multiple States\", urging the Georgia legislature to convene a special session for the \"purpose of considering issues pertaining to the appointment of Presidential Electors\". Clark presented the draft letter to acting attorney general Jeffrey Rosen and his deputy Richard Donoghue for their signatures; they rejected the proposal and the letter was never sent.[26][27][28][29][30][31][32]\nTrump pressured Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to change the state's election results during an hour-long conference call on January 2, 2021.[33] Trump told Raffensperger, \"What I want to do is this.

But at what cost? - Georgia Recorder\n\nGoogle Search Snippet:\nDecember 2, 2025 5:00 am. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis discusses the indictments against then-former President Donald Trump and 18 others on ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nThe State of Georgia v. Donald J. Trump, et al. was a criminal case against Donald Trump, the 45th and eventually-47th president of the United States, and 18 co-defendants. All defendants were charged with one count of violating Georgia's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statute, which would have had a penalty of 5\u201320 years in prison. The indictment came in the context of Trump's broader effort to overturn his loss in the 2020 presidential election. The case was one of four criminal indictments against Trump, all charged in 2023.\nDefendants were variously charged with 40 additional counts from other allegations, including: Trump and co-defendants plotted to create pro-Trump slates of fake electors;[1] Trump called the Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, asking him to \"find 11,780 votes\", which would have reversed his loss in the state by a single vote margin;[2] and a small group of Trump allies in Coffee County illegally accessed voting systems attempting to find evidence of election fraud.[3]\nFollowing an investigation launched in February 2021 by Fulton County district attorney Fani Willis, a grand jury of 23 citizens handed up the indictments on August 14, 2023.[4] Her prosecution alleged that Trump led a \"criminal racketeering enterprise\", in which he and all other defendants \"knowingly and willfully joined a conspiracy to unlawfully change the outcome\" of the 2020 U.S. presidential election in Georgia.\nThe case was set to be heard in the Fulton County Superior Court with judge Scott F. McAfee presiding.[5] Former Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows, former Department of Justice (DOJ) official Jeffrey Clark, and three other defendants unsuccessfully sought to have their cases removed to federal court.[6] Four defendants pleaded guilty to some charges, agreed to cooperate with the prosecution, and received sentences including probation, fines, and making public apologies.[7]\nAfter pausing the case,[8] the Georgia Court of Appeals in December 2024 disqualified Willis from prosecuting it.[9] In November 2025, Pete Skandalakis, executive director of the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia, took on the role of prosecutor.[10] Less than two weeks later, on November 26, he dropped all charges against all remaining defendants, ending the case.[11][12]\nWeeks before the 2016 presidential election, Trump claimed through a series of tweets that widespread voter fraud was imminent, a sentiment echoed by his legal advisor, Rudy Giuliani.[13] Trump repeated the accusations throughout his presidency and into his 2020 reelection campaign; for months, he prepared arguments in the event of his loss, primarily relating to mail-in ballots.[14] As early as August 2020, he enlisted conservative activist and lawyer Cleta Mitchell to help overturn the election.[15] Two days before Election Day (November 3, 2020), he told reporters that he would be \"going in with [his] lawyers\" as soon as the election was over.[16]\nOn Election Day, preliminary surveys at polling places showed Trump in the lead as his supporters were more likely to turn out in person amid the COVID-19 pandemic, but his lead diminished as mail-in ballots were counted.[17] At the behest of Giuliani, Trump declared in a 2 a.m. election night speech in the East Room that he had won the election and that the counts being reported were fraudulent.[18] As ballots were being counted, campaign data expert Matt Oczkowski bluntly informed Trump that he was going to lose the election. White House Counsel Pat Cipollone told him that invalidating the results of the election would be a \"murder-suicide pact\".[19] Under then-attorney general William Barr, the Department of Justice failed to find widespread voter fraud in the election.[20]\nFormer speaker of the House Newt Gingrich predicted that Trump voters would erupt in \"rage\",[21] a sentiment shared by House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, who told Laura Ingraham on The Ingraham Angle that Republicans should \"not be silent about this\".[22]\nOn December 3, 2020, a 7-hour hearing of the Georgia Senate Committee on the Judiciary heard Trump's legal team, including Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman, made false claims alleging fraud and misconduct in the state's election process, and that the Georgia legislature had the power to appoint electors for Trump.[23][24] A similar presentation was made to the Georgia House of Representatives Committee on Governmental Relations.\nOn December 7, Trump called Georgia House Speaker David Ralston asking him to convene a special session of the state legislature to overturn the Georgia election results.[25]\nIn late December 2020 and early January 2021, Jeffrey Clark, the Assistant Attorney General for the Environment and Natural Resources Division and acting for the DOJ Civil Division, drafted a letter to Georgia officials stating the DOJ had \"identified significant concerns that may have impacted the outcome of the election in multiple States\", urging the Georgia legislature to convene a special session for the \"purpose of considering issues pertaining to the appointment of Presidential Electors\". Clark presented the draft letter to acting attorney general Jeffrey Rosen and his deputy Richard Donoghue for their signatures; they rejected the proposal and the letter was never sent.[26][27][28][29][30][31][32]\nTrump pressured Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to change the state's election results during an hour-long conference call on January 2, 2021.[33] Trump told Raffensperger, \"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes, which is one more than [the 11,779-vote margin of defeat] we have, because we won the state.\"[34]\nOn September 17, Trump wrote to Raffensperger, alleging that 43,000 ballots in DeKalb County had been mishandled and that Raffensperger should \"start the process of decertifying the election, or whatever the correct legal remedy is, and announce the true winner.\" In the 2023 Georgia indictmen\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

These findings are in addition to prior concerns regarding actions by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, the Secretary, and others impacting the conduct of the election. A comparison of official county election results to the total number of voters who voted on November 3, 2020 as recorded by the Department of State shows that 6,962,607 total ballots were reported as being cast, while DoS/SURE system records indicate that only 6,760,230 total voters actually voted. Among the 6,962,607 total ballots cast, 6,931,060 total votes were counted in the presidential race, including all three candidates on the ballot and write-in candidates. The difference of 202,377 more votes cast than voters voting, together with the 31,547 over- and under-votes in the presidential race, adds up to an alarming discrepancy of 170,830 votes, which is more than twice the reported statewide difference between the two major candidates for President of the United States. On November 24, 2020, Boockvar certified election results, and Wolf issued a certificate of ascertainment of presidential electors, stating that Vice President Joe Biden received 80,555 more votes than President Donald Trump. The lawmakers issued the following statement in response to their findings: \u201cWe were already concerned with the actions of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, the Executive branch, and election officials in certain counties contravening and undermining the Pennsylvania Election Code by eliminating signature verification, postmarks, and due dates while allowing the proliferation of drop boxes with questionable security measures and the unauthorized curing of ballots, as well as the questionable treatment of poll watchers, all of which created wholesale opportunities for irregularities in the 2020 presidential election.\u201d \u201cHowever, we are now seeing discrepancies on the retail level which raise even more troubling questions regarding irregularities in the election returns. These findings call into question the accuracy of the SURE system, consistency in the application of the Pennsylvania Election Code from county to county, and the competency of those charged with oversight of elections in our Commonwealth. \u201cThese numbers just don\u2019t add up, and the alleged certification of Pennsylvania\u2019s presidential election results was absolutely premature, unconfirmed, and in error.\u201d State Rep.
