See more details\nInterferon (IFN) inhibits HIV replication by inducing antiviral effectors. To comprehensively identify IFN-induced HIV restriction factors, we assembled a CRISPR sgRNA library of Interferon Stimulated Genes (ISGs) into a modified lentiviral vector that allows for packaging of sgRNA-encoding genomes in trans into budding HIV-1 particles. We observed that knockout of Zinc Antiviral Protein (ZAP) improved the performance of the screen due to ZAP-mediated inhibition of the vector. A small panel of IFN-induced HIV restriction factors, including MxB, IFITM1, Tetherin/BST2 and TRIM5alpha together explain the inhibitory effects of IFN on the CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 strain, HIV-1LAI, in THP-1 cells. A second screen with a CCR5-tropic primary strain, HIV-1Q23.BG505, described an overlapping, but non-identical, panel of restriction factors. Further, this screen also identifies HIV dependency factors. The ability of IFN-induced restriction factors to inhibit HIV strains to replicate in human cells suggests that these human restriction factors are incompletely antagonized.\nEditorial note: This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review. The Reviewing Editor's assessment is that all the issues have been addressed (see decision letter).\nThe different strains of the human immunodeficiency virus (or HIV) can infect a variety of cells in the human body. When a cell senses being attacked, it can defend itself using molecules called restriction factors, which are created under the control of a signal known as interferon.\nResearchers have already identified several restriction factors, using techniques that are relatively laborious and time-consuming, but many questions remain about these proteins. Here, Ohainle et al. created a new method to screen for restriction factors; by harnessing the CRISPR/Cas9 technique, HIV was tricked into revealing its own weaknesses. The method allowed Ohainle et al. to make precise, targeted changes to thousands of genes that are turned on by interferon, and deactivate them. The experiments revealed that HIV multiplied better in human cells in which several specific genes had been neutralized. This suggests that these genes encode restriction factors that are activated by interferon to combat HIV. The combined action of a few of these proteins can fight the virus, even if it cannot completely eradicate it. Further experiments found that a different, but overlapping set of restriction factors defended cells against a different strain of HIV.\nThe method developed by Ohainle et al. is a useful tool to identify new restriction factors. By dissecting the role of these proteins in keeping different HIV strains under control, we may understand how the virus has become dangerous for humans by evading some of these defenses. Ultimately, this could help with finding better ways to fight this deadly disease.\nThe HIV-1 pandemic resulted from a series of successive cross-species transmissions of primate lentiviruses. Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) transmission from African Old World primates to chimpanzees yielded the recombinant virus SIVcpz, which ultimately crossed into humans (Sharp and Hahn, 2011). Successful replication of lentiviruses in a new host species required adaptation to restriction factors in the new host (Etienne et al., 2015; Etienne et al., 2013; Kirmaier et al., 2010). Restriction factors that target primate lentiviruses include TRIM5alpha, MxB, Tetherin, SAMHD1, the APOBEC3 family of cytidine deaminases (Malim and Bieniasz, 2012) and more recently described factors such as SERINC3/5, Zinc Antiviral Protein (ZAP), GBP5, SLFN11, LGALS3BP (90K), the HUSH complex (Chougui et al., 2018; Krapp et al., 2016; Li et al., 2012; Lodermeyer et al., 2013; Rosa et al., 2015; Takata et al., 2017; Usami et al., 2015; Yurkovetskiy et al., 2018), as well as nearly 200 other proposed factors (reviewed in (G\u00e9linas et al., 2018). HIV-1 has evolved accessory proteins that degrade many host restriction factors (Duggal and Emerman, 2012). Further, mutations preventing recognition by restriction factors, such as evolution of low CG dinucleotide content in the HIV-1 genome (Takata et al., 2017) or mutations in capsid (Kirmaier et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2013), represent another mechanism of escape.\nMany restriction factors that target HIV-1 are induced by type I Interferon (IFN) and are therefore Interferon-Stimulated Genes (ISGs). Interferon has been implicated in at least partial control of HIV replication in chronically-infected individuals treated with IFN (Asmuth et al., 2010; Azzoni et al., 2013) as well as in SIV-infected rhesus macaques (Sandler et al., 2014). In contrast, IFN levels have also been correlated with higher viral load and decreased CD4 T cell counts in HIV-infected individuals (Hardy et al., 2013). Further, it appears that ISG expression exerts changing selective pressure on HIV evolution in vivo since transmitted/founder (T/F) strains are relatively resistant to IFN compared to viruses isolated later in infection (Fenton-May et al., 2013; Iyer et al., 2017; Parrish et al., 2013). It remains to be determined if one dominant ISG mediates all or most of the IFN inhibition, or if a multitude of antiviral ISGs together limit viral replication in response to IFN.\nThe HIV-1 LAI strain (HIV-1LAI) was isolated from a chronically-infected individual (Wain-Hobson et al., 1991) and is sensitive to type I IFN. Specifically, potent IFN\u03b1 inhibition of HIV-1LAI can be observed in the THP-1 monocytic cell line (Goujon and Malim, 2010). MxB, an interferon-induced GTPase that binds to and blocks lentiviral capsids, was identified as an IFN\u03b1-induced factor in THP-1 cells (Goujon et al., 2013; Haller et al., 2015; Kane et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013), although the role of MxB in the IFN\u03b1-induced inhibi\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) transmission from African Old World primates to chimpanzees yielded the recombinant virus SIVcpz, which ultimately crossed into humans (Sharp and Hahn, 2011). Successful replication of lentiviruses in a new host species required adaptation to restriction factors in the new host (Etienne et al., 2015; Etienne et al., 2013; Kirmaier et al., 2010). Restriction factors that target primate lentiviruses include TRIM5alpha, MxB, Tetherin, SAMHD1, the APOBEC3 family of cytidine deaminases (Malim and Bieniasz, 2012) and more recently described factors such as SERINC3/5, Zinc Antiviral Protein (ZAP), GBP5, SLFN11, LGALS3BP (90K), the HUSH complex (Chougui et al., 2018; Krapp et al., 2016; Li et al., 2012; Lodermeyer et al., 2013; Rosa et al., 2015; Takata et al., 2017; Usami et al., 2015; Yurkovetskiy et al., 2018), as well as nearly 200 other proposed factors (reviewed in (G\u00e9linas et al., 2018). HIV-1 has evolved accessory proteins that degrade many host restriction factors (Duggal and Emerman, 2012). Further, mutations preventing recognition by restriction factors, such as evolution of low CG dinucleotide content in the HIV-1 genome (Takata et al., 2017) or mutations in capsid (Kirmaier et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2013), represent another mechanism of escape.\nMany restriction factors that target HIV-1 are induced by type I Interferon (IFN) and are therefore Interferon-Stimulated Genes (ISGs). Interferon has been implicated in at least partial control of HIV replication in chronically-infected individuals treated with IFN (Asmuth et al., 2010; Azzoni et al., 2013) as well as in SIV-infected rhesus macaques (Sandler et al., 2014). In contrast, IFN levels have also been correlated with higher viral load and decreased CD4 T cell counts in HIV-infected individuals (Hardy et al., 2013). Further, it appears that ISG expression exerts changing selective pressure on HIV evolution in vivo since transmitted/founder (T/F) strains are relatively resistant to IFN compared to viruses isolated later in infection (Fenton-May et al., 2013; Iyer et al., 2017; Parrish et al., 2013). It remains to be determined if one dominant ISG mediates all or most of the IFN inhibition, or if a multitude of antiviral ISGs together limit viral replication in response to IFN.\nThe HIV-1 LAI strain (HIV-1LAI) was isolated from a chronically-infected individual (Wain-Hobson et al., 1991) and is sensitive to type I IFN. Specifically, potent IFN\u03b1 inhibition of HIV-1LAI can be observed in the THP-1 monocytic cell line (Goujon and Malim, 2010). MxB, an interferon-induced GTPase that binds to and blocks lentiviral capsids, was identified as an IFN\u03b1-induced factor in THP-1 cells (Goujon et al., 2013; Haller et al., 2015; Kane et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013), although the role of MxB in the IFN\u03b1-induced inhibi\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

In this context, research strategies to mitigate inflammation among people with HIV on suppressive ART have typically taken one of three approaches: (1) target the root drivers of immune activation specific to HIV disease, (2) downregulate inflammatory pathways broadly, or (3) leverage anti-inflammatory properties of medications targeting traditional risk factors.\nThe HIV-related mechanisms driving immune activation have been posited to include viral persistence, permanent injury impairing immune recovery (i.e., due to lymphatic tissue fibrosis), presence of copathogens, as well as dysbiosis and microbial translocation.32-36 Among these mechanisms, investigational approaches have targeted HIV reactivation from latently infected cells, fibrotic pathways, the gut microbiome, and cytomegalovirus coinfection.27,37-41 However, thus far, none of these strategies have improved clinical outcomes.

See more details\nInterferon (IFN) inhibits HIV replication by inducing antiviral effectors. To comprehensively identify IFN-induced HIV restriction factors, we assembled a CRISPR sgRNA library of Interferon Stimulated Genes (ISGs) into a modified lentiviral vector that allows for packaging of sgRNA-encoding genomes in trans into budding HIV-1 particles. We observed that knockout of Zinc Antiviral Protein (ZAP) improved the performance of the screen due to ZAP-mediated inhibition of the vector. A small panel of IFN-induced HIV restriction factors, including MxB, IFITM1, Tetherin/BST2 and TRIM5alpha together explain the inhibitory effects of IFN on the CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 strain, HIV-1LAI, in THP-1 cells. A second screen with a CCR5-tropic primary strain, HIV-1Q23.BG505, described an overlapping, but non-identical, panel of restriction factors. Further, this screen also identifies HIV dependency factors. The ability of IFN-induced restriction factors to inhibit HIV strains to replicate in human cells suggests that these human restriction factors are incompletely antagonized.\nEditorial note: This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review. The Reviewing Editor's assessment is that all the issues have been addressed (see decision letter).\nThe different strains of the human immunodeficiency virus (or HIV) can infect a variety of cells in the human body. When a cell senses being attacked, it can defend itself using molecules called restriction factors, which are created under the control of a signal known as interferon.\nResearchers have already identified several restriction factors, using techniques that are relatively laborious and time-consuming, but many questions remain about these proteins. Here, Ohainle et al. created a new method to screen for restriction factors; by harnessing the CRISPR/Cas9 technique, HIV was tricked into revealing its own weaknesses. The method allowed Ohainle et al. to make precise, targeted changes to thousands of genes that are turned on by interferon, and deactivate them. The experiments revealed that HIV multiplied better in human cells in which several specific genes had been neutralized. This suggests that these genes encode restriction factors that are activated by interferon to combat HIV. The combined action of a few of these proteins can fight the virus, even if it cannot completely eradicate it. Further experiments found that a different, but overlapping set of restriction factors defended cells against a different strain of HIV.\nThe method developed by Ohainle et al. is a useful tool to identify new restriction factors. By dissecting the role of these proteins in keeping different HIV strains under control, we may understand how the virus has become dangerous for humans by evading some of these defenses. Ultimately, this could help with finding better ways to fight this deadly disease.\nThe HIV-1 pandemic resulted from a series of successive cross-species transmissions of primate lentiviruses. Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) transmission from African Old World primates to chimpanzees yielded the recombinant virus SIVcpz, which ultimately crossed into humans (Sharp and Hahn, 2011). Successful replication of lentiviruses in a new host species required adaptation to restriction factors in the new host (Etienne et al., 2015; Etienne et al., 2013; Kirmaier et al., 2010). Restriction factors that target primate lentiviruses include TRIM5alpha, MxB, Tetherin, SAMHD1, the APOBEC3 family of cytidine deaminases (Malim and Bieniasz, 2012) and more recently described factors such as SERINC3/5, Zinc Antiviral Protein (ZAP), GBP5, SLFN11, LGALS3BP (90K), the HUSH complex (Chougui et al., 2018; Krapp et al., 2016; Li et al., 2012; Lodermeyer et al., 2013; Rosa et al., 2015; Takata et al., 2017; Usami et al., 2015; Yurkovetskiy et al., 2018), as well as nearly 200 other proposed factors (reviewed in (G\u00e9linas et al., 2018). HIV-1 has evolved accessory proteins that degrade many host restriction factors (Duggal and Emerman, 2012). Further, mutations preventing recognition by restriction factors, such as evolution of low CG dinucleotide content in the HIV-1 genome (Takata et al., 2017) or mutations in capsid (Kirmaier et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2013), represent another mechanism of escape.\nMany restriction factors that target HIV-1 are induced by type I Interferon (IFN) and are therefore Interferon-Stimulated Genes (ISGs). Interferon has been implicated in at least partial control of HIV replication in chronically-infected individuals treated with IFN (Asmuth et al., 2010; Azzoni et al., 2013) as well as in SIV-infected rhesus macaques (Sandler et al., 2014). In contrast, IFN levels have also been correlated with higher viral load and decreased CD4 T cell counts in HIV-infected individuals (Hardy et al., 2013). Further, it appears that ISG expression exerts changing selective pressure on HIV evolution in vivo since transmitted/founder (T/F) strains are relatively resistant to IFN compared to viruses isolated later in infection (Fenton-May et al., 2013; Iyer et al., 2017; Parrish et al., 2013).

If CD4 levels are low, this may indicate that HIV has progressed into AIDS.\nHelper T cells are crucial for immune system function and activate after encountering antigens from disease-causing microorganisms. Antigens are biological markers that identify microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses.\nWhen a CD4 count falls below a certain level, a person receives an AIDS diagnosis. The treatment a healthcare professional suggests depends on how low the CD4 count is.\nKeep reading to learn more about T cells and their function and the link between T cell level and HIV and AIDS.\nT cells grow from stem cells in the bone marrow. They are a type of white blood cell. There are two main types of T cells: helper T cells and killer T cells. Ultimately, it is the killer T cells that attack and kill cells that pathogens have infected.\nMacrophages are another type of white blood cell. They consume disease-causing microorganisms, or pathogens, then present fragments of their antigens to helper T cells. When a helper T cell binds to the antigen fragment that it recognizes, it activates and alerts other white blood cells to the pathogen.\nHelper T cells have CD4 proteins on their cell surface, which help them bind to antigen fragments. Because HIV destroys helper T cells, healthcare professionals use a CD4 count to measure CD4 levels and HIV progression.\nAfter receiving the alert, killer T cells seek out and destroy the pathogen (virus, bacteria, or disease-causing microorganisms). Other white blood cells, such as B lymphocytes, will also activate and produce antibodies in order to protect against the threat.\nLearn more about T cells here.\nHIV enters its genetic information into helper T cells to make copies of itself. When this happens, the helper T cells die. This severely disrupts the immune response. Low levels of helper T cells mean killer T cells and other white blood cells do not receive as much information about pathogens in the body. As a result, disease-causing bacteria and viruses multiply with minimal detection.\nWhen the amount of helper T cells falls below 200 cells/mm3 (cells per cubic millimeter), a person may receive an AIDS diagnosis. But healthcare professionals will also take into account other variables such as overall white blood cell count and the percentage of lymphocytes.\nAIDS is the most severe stage of HIV. When a person receives an AIDS diagnosis, their immune system is severely compromised, and they are at risk for opportunistic illnesses. The survival rate without treatment at this stage is typically 3 years .\nCD4 T cells are helper T cells. They express, or manifest, a CD4 protein on their cell surface that helps them bind to antigen fragments. These antigen fragments belong to viruses, bacteria, and other microorganisms that could threaten a person\u2019s health. Killer T cells express a CD8 protein on their cell surface.\nWhen activated, helper T cells mobilize other white blood cells to initiate a full immune response. Killer T cells, for example, then seek out the pathogen and destroy it by releasing granzymes, which trigger cell death.\nIf someone\u2019s helper T cells are below 200 cells/mm3 , they will likely receive an AIDS diagnosis.\nWhen a person has HIV, a healthcare professional will collect a blood sample and request a CD4 count. The CD4 count helps determine how many helper T cells a person has.\nBut when analyzing a CD4 count, healthcare professionals must take into account that:\nAll people whose helper T cells are below 200 cells/mm3 should receive a CD4 count every 3\u20136 months. If treatment is working, a person may only need a CD4 checkup every 6\u201312 months.\nThe CD4 count helps healthcare professionals monitor HIV progression and if the person is at risk for opportunistic illnesses.\nWhen a healthcare professional wants a CD4 count, they take a blood sample from a person\u2019s arm.\nSide effects of drawing blood may include:\nA healthcare professional will likely only need to draw a small amount of blood, so a person should not feel any significant side effects.\nUsually, when someone receives an HIV diagnosis, they will start antiretroviral therapy (ART) as soon as possible .\nIf a person responds well to ART, their CD4 levels may increase by 100\u2013150cells/mm3 after 1 year.\nAfter analyzing a CD4 count, a healthcare professional can determine if the current care plan is working or if they need to introduce additional treatments.\nAs soon as CD4 levels drop below 200 cells/mm3, a healthcare professional may need to increase ART and administer other drugs to help bolster the immune system against opportunistic illnesses.\nAll people with HIV should receive a CD4 count every 3\u20136 months if their CD4 levels are below 200 cells/mm3, as this indicates a progression to AIDS. If the treatment is working and the CD4 count is stable, a person may only need a checkup every 6\u201312 months.\nIf a person receives an HIV diagnosis in time and starts ART promptly , it is unlikely their condition will progress to AIDS.\nTaking ART not only keeps the volume of helper T cells high but also decreases the viral load (the amount of virus in the body).\nIf someone\u2019s viral load decreases, it may reach an undetectable level. This means if a person keeps up the treatment for their condition, the virus cannot transmit to anyone through sex. Having an undetectable viral load also reduces HIV transmission during birth.\nA healthcare professional requests a CD4 count to monitor helper T cell levels. When a person\u2019s CD4 levels drop below 200 cells/mm3 , the healthcare professional may diagnose that person with AIDS. If someone begins ART promptly after receiving an HIV diagnosis, their condition may never progress to AIDS.\nT cells include two main types: helper T cells and killer T cells.

Diagnosis and staging were based on the 2014 US surveillance case definition for HIV infection. We divided early HIV-1 infection (stage 0) into two subcategories. Subcategory 0\u03b1: a negative or indeterminate HIV-1 antibody test was \u226460 days after the first confirmed positive HIV-1 test or a negative or indeterminate antibody test or qualitative HIV-1 nucleic acid test (NAT) was \u2264180 days before the first positive test, the latter being a NAT or detectable viral load. Subcategory 0\u03b2: a negative or indeterminate antibody or qualitative NAT was \u2264180 days before the first positive test, the latter being an HIV antibody or antigen/antibody test. We compared median earliest viral loads for each stage and subcategory in each of the first 6 weeks after diagnosis using only the earliest viral load for each individual.\nResults: Of 203,392 infections, 56.69% (115,297/203,392) were reported with a quantified earliest viral load within 6 weeks after diagnosis and criteria sufficient to determine the stage at diagnosis. Among 5081 infections at stage 0, the median earliest viral load fell from 694,000 copies/mL in week 1 to 125,022 in week 2 and 43,473 by week 6. Among 30,910 infections in stage 1, the median earliest viral load ranged 15,412-17,495. Among 42,784 infections in stage 2, the median viral load declined from 44,973 in week 1 to 38,497 in week 6. Among 36,522 infections in stage 3 (AIDS), the median viral load dropped from 205,862 in week 1 to 119,000 in week 6. The median earliest viral load in stage 0 subcategory 0\u03b1 fell from 1,344,590 copies/mL in week 1 to 362,467 in week 2 and 47,320 in week 6, while that in subcategory 0\u03b2 was 70,114 copies/mL in week 1 and then 32,033 to 44,067 in weeks 2-6. The median viral load in subcategory 0\u03b1 was higher than that in subcategory 0\u03b2 in each of the first 6 weeks after diagnosis (<.001).\nPlease cite as:\nSelik RM, Linley L Viral Loads Within 6 Weeks After Diagnosis of HIV Infection in Early and Later Stages: Observational Study Using National Surveillance Data JMIR Public Health Surveill 2018;4(4):e10770 doi: 10.2196/10770 PMID: 30401660 PMCID: 6246969\nWelcome to jmir.org\nYour personal data will be processed and information from your device (cookies, unique identifiers, and other device data) may be stored by, accessed by and shared with 141 TCF vendor(s) and 69 ad partner(s), or used specifically by this site.\nSome vendors may process your personal data on the basis of legitimate interest, which you can object to by managing your options below.

HIV infects and deletes CD4+ T cells that normally coordinate the adaptive T- and B-cell response to defend against intracellular pathogens. The immune defect is immediate and profound: At the time of acute infection with an AIDS virus, typically more than half of the gut-associated CD4+ T cells are depleted, leaving a damaged immune system to contend with a life-long infection.\nAt the time of acute HIV infection, more than half of the gut-associated CD4+ T cells are depleted, leaving a damaged immune system to contend with a life-long infection.\nThe earliest studies of T-cell function among infected persons revealed aspects of HIV immunopathogenesis that are still not fully understood. Despite initial and persistent damage to CD4+ T cells, and a lack of detectable HIV-specific CD4+ T helper cells (Murray et al. 1984; Lane et al. 1985), the magnitude and breadth of CD8+ T-cell responses to HIV in infected humans were found to be robust, with direct effector function of such a magnitude that it could be readily detected in freshly isolated lymphocytes from peripheral blood and brochoalveolar lavage in persons with AIDS (Plata et al. 1987; Walker et al. 1987; Nixon et al. 1988). HIV was already known to be an immunosuppressive disease, yet these cells were present in such robust quantity that they could be detected by assays measuring the ability of freshly isolated peripheral blood cells to lyse autologous B cells infected with recombinant vaccinia-HIV vectors or peptide pulsed targets (Walker et al. 1987; Nixon et al. 1988). Moreover, CD8+ T cells from infected persons were able to inhibit HIV replication (Walker et al. 1986), clearly showing that these cells were functional at least in vitro, but despite this, persons were progressing to AIDS.\nSubsequent studies using other approaches such as interferon \u03b3 Elispot (Dalod et al. 1999), intracellular cytokine (Maecker et al. 2001), and peptide MHC tetramer assays (Altman et al. 1996) confirmed and quantified these robust CD8+ T-cell responses. Most chronically infected persons target more than a dozen CD8+ epitopes simultaneously (Addo et al. 2003), and in some instances up to 19% of CD8+ T cells are specific for HIV (Richardson 2000; Betts et al. 2001; Papagno et al. 2002), yet control of viremia is not achieved. At the same time, HIV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses were found to be severely impaired, particularly as measured by the ability of these cells to proliferate to viral antigens (Wahren et al. 1987). Thus, from the early studies there was a clear disconnect between the lack of HIV-specific CD4+ T cells and the abundance of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells.\nDespite these conundrums, there were early signs that CD8+ T cells play a role in controlling HIV disease progression. Sequencing of autologous virus from infected persons revealed evidence of immune selection pressure mediated by these responses (Phillips et al. 1991) and an association with the initial decline in peak viremia after acute infection (Borrow et al. 1994; Koup et al. 1994). The development of HLA-class I-peptide tetramers confirmed the presence of robust induction of responses to multiple epitopes (Altman et al. 1996), and as larger numbers of patients were studied, it also became clear that among the strongest associations with disease outcome was the expression of certain HLA class I alleles (Kaslow et al. 1996; Migueles et al. 2000; Gao et al. 2001), implicating class I restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) as a major modulator of disease progression. The relationship between CD8+ T-cell immune function and viral control was shown by experimental depletion of CD8+ T cells in animal models of AIDS virus infection (Jin et al. 1999; Schmitz et al. 1999). As sensitive viral load assays became available, it also became clear that some infected persons were able to control viremia to levels below detection by the most sensitive RNA assays, and that these persons were characterized by robust HIV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses (Rosenberg et al. 1997). However, now a quarter century into the epidemic the precise role of T cells in HIV control, and the precise phenotype, specificity and function of T cells that should be induced with a vaccine, remain unclear. And from the standpoint of vaccine development, it remains controversial as to how much insight is to be gained from the study of persons who have become infected, because by definition these are not protective responses.\nAcute HIV infection is often associated with a transient febrile illness, much like infectious mononucleosis (Ho et al. 1985), which has facilitated the identification of persons in the earliest stages of infection, who are HIV RNA positive but not yet HIV antibody positive. Important justification for the intense study of acute infection is the demonstration that early events predict subsequent disease progression (Mellors et al. 1996; Lyles et al. 2000). Acute infection is associated with a decline in peak viremia from \u223c1\u20135 million viral copies/mL to a steady state of \u223c30,000 copies (Lyles et al. 2000), but peak levels of viremia may be much lower in asymptomatic persons (Fiebig et al. 2003). Very few studies have actually examined CD8+ T-cell responses in the earliest stages of infection (Fiebig stage I and II), but when those studies have been performed it is clear that initial immune responses are very narrowly directed (Goonetilleke et al. 2009) and remain narrowly directed as viral set point is achieved (Dalod et al. 1999; Altfeld et al. 2001). Even when responses to autologous virus are measured, the initial detectable response has usually been to only one to three epitopes (Goonetilleke et al. 2009), even though the autologou\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The tissue distribution of potential therapeutics ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nAdvances in antiretroviral therapy (ART) have saved numerous lives, converting a diagnosis with HIV-1 from a death sentence into the possibility for a (nearly) normal life in many instances. However, the obligation for lifelong adherence, increased risk of accumulated co-morbidities, and continued lack of uniform availability around the globe underscores the need for an HIV cure. Safe and scalable HIV cure strategies remain elusive, in large part due to the presence of viral reservoirs in which caches of infected cells remain hidden from immune elimination, primarily within tissues. Herein, we summarize some of the most exciting recent advances focused on understanding, quantifying, and ultimately targeting HIV tissue viral reservoirs.\nCurrent studies have underscored the differences between viral reservoirs in tissue compartments as compared to peripheral blood, in particular the gastrointestinal tract. Additionally, several novel or modified techniques are showing promise in targeting the latent viral reservoir, including modifications in drug delivery platforms and techniques such as CRISPR.\nElimination of tissue viral reservoirs are likely the key to generation of an effective HIV cure. Exciting studies have come out recently that reveal crucial insights into topics ranging from the basic biology of reservoir seeding to effective drug targeting. However, there are still many outstanding questions in the field about the relative importance of specific reservoirs, such as the gastrointestinal tract, that may alter the final strategy pursued.\nKeywords: HIV, SIV, Reservoir, Lymph Node, Lymphoid tissue, Gastrointestinal Tract\nIn-depth characterization of cellular and anatomic reservoirs for HIV-1, the tissue compartments in which they reside, salient phenotypic characteristics of viral reservoirs, and environmental signals within defined neighborhoods that are critical for persistence remain poorly understood, yet are likely crucial for understanding how to effectively target and eliminate tissue viral reservoirs. Earlier studies of ART in both HIV-1 infected individuals and SIV infected nonhuman primates (NHPs) demonstrated that viral reservoirs are established rapidly and systemically [1]. While reduced by ART, these reservoirs constitute a substantial total body burden of potentially infectious virus [2] resulting in plasma viral loads (pVLs) that, while previously undetectable on ART, rapidly rise upon treatment interruption in all but the rarest circumstances. Since natural, ART-free viral remission is highly infrequent and complete viral eradication via hematopoietic stem cell transplant is neither safe nor feasible at scale, the field has been working towards targeting tissue viral reservoirs that remain a stubborn barrier to an HIV cure.\nLymphoid tissues (LT) are a major source of HIV-infected cells at all stages of infection. Our group and others have shown that LT, including the gut, lymph nodes, and spleen, contain \u226598% of \u2018active\u2019 (vRNA+) and total (vDNA+) SIV reservoirs before and during ART [2]. Even after ART, HIV-1 and SIV persist in these LT compartments for a variety of reasons (Figure 1), including: i) Tissue resident T follicular helper (TFH) cells, which are a preferred cellular reservoir for HIV, and follicular dendritic cells (FDC; a non-infected cellular repository of infectious virions) are long-lived viral reservoirs that reside within B cell follicles (BCF) found in secondary LTs [3, 4**]; ii) residual levels of immune activation and inflammatory mediators are heightened in many LTs (in particular the GALT) during ART [5]; iii) antiretroviral (ARV) drug penetration (particularly protease inhibitors) into tissue sites of viral persistence is very heterogeneous with limited combined exposure to all infected cells, potentially allowing for environments where low level, intermittent viral replication can occur [6, 7*]; and iv) BCFs represent relative immune sanctuaries that are not highly accessible to HIV-1/SIV-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (CTLs), thereby allowing viral reservoirs that reside in these microenvironments to escape CTL elimination [8]. While of interest to the field, non-LT viral reservoirs fall outside the scope of this review, primarily because the mechanisms controlling reservoir establishment, persistence, and clearance have aspects which are unique to each tissue site. A prime example is the brain and CNS, in which recent publications have elucidated how HIV-infected microglia and astrocytes are maintained as well as therapeutic strategies specifically designed to cross the blood-brain barrier, a distinct prerequisite for targeting the CNS reservoir (for a review, see [9]). Given the number of recent and exciting publications, separate reviews are required to do justice to these often rapidly developing fields.\nViral Persistence in Lymphoid Tissues. HIV and SIV can persist in LTs throughout the body even after ART due to: 1) persistence of viral reservoirs in BCFs (both TFH cells and FDCs); 2) residual levels of immune activation and inflammation; 3) incomplete ARV penetration into tissue sites potentially leading to low and intermittent levels of viral replication; and 4) limited accessibility of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells into BCFs. Created with BioRender.com\nIn both HIV-1 and SIV infection, seeding of viral reservoirs occurs early and systemically, especially within LT where the majority of CD4+ T cells reside. This is supported by studies in rhesus macaques showing that long-lived reservoirs harboring replication-competent virus are established as early as 3 days after infection [1] and that integrated HIV-1 DNA in acutely infected individuals can be detected in gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and LNs as early as Fiebig stage I and reach maximal frequencies by Fiebig stage II [10*]. Moreover, at later stages of infection, the frequency of viral DNA is actually higher in LNs than periphe\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

New Study Reveals the Steps\n\nGoogle Search Snippet:\nA new study reveals for the first time the steps through which human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) binds to the receptors on the membranes of T cells.\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nHIV is a disease in which the original clinical observations of severe opportunistic infections gave the first clues regarding the underlying pathology, namely that HIV is essentially an infection of the immune system. HIV infects and deletes CD4+ T cells that normally coordinate the adaptive T- and B-cell response to defend against intracellular pathogens. The immune defect is immediate and profound: At the time of acute infection with an AIDS virus, typically more than half of the gut-associated CD4+ T cells are depleted, leaving a damaged immune system to contend with a life-long infection.\nAt the time of acute HIV infection, more than half of the gut-associated CD4+ T cells are depleted, leaving a damaged immune system to contend with a life-long infection.\nThe earliest studies of T-cell function among infected persons revealed aspects of HIV immunopathogenesis that are still not fully understood. Despite initial and persistent damage to CD4+ T cells, and a lack of detectable HIV-specific CD4+ T helper cells (Murray et al. 1984; Lane et al. 1985), the magnitude and breadth of CD8+ T-cell responses to HIV in infected humans were found to be robust, with direct effector function of such a magnitude that it could be readily detected in freshly isolated lymphocytes from peripheral blood and brochoalveolar lavage in persons with AIDS (Plata et al. 1987; Walker et al. 1987; Nixon et al. 1988). HIV was already known to be an immunosuppressive disease, yet these cells were present in such robust quantity that they could be detected by assays measuring the ability of freshly isolated peripheral blood cells to lyse autologous B cells infected with recombinant vaccinia-HIV vectors or peptide pulsed targets (Walker et al. 1987; Nixon et al. 1988). Moreover, CD8+ T cells from infected persons were able to inhibit HIV replication (Walker et al. 1986), clearly showing that these cells were functional at least in vitro, but despite this, persons were progressing to AIDS.\nSubsequent studies using other approaches such as interferon \u03b3 Elispot (Dalod et al. 1999), intracellular cytokine (Maecker et al. 2001), and peptide MHC tetramer assays (Altman et al. 1996) confirmed and quantified these robust CD8+ T-cell responses. Most chronically infected persons target more than a dozen CD8+ epitopes simultaneously (Addo et al. 2003), and in some instances up to 19% of CD8+ T cells are specific for HIV (Richardson 2000; Betts et al. 2001; Papagno et al. 2002), yet control of viremia is not achieved. At the same time, HIV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses were found to be severely impaired, particularly as measured by the ability of these cells to proliferate to viral antigens (Wahren et al. 1987). Thus, from the early studies there was a clear disconnect between the lack of HIV-specific CD4+ T cells and the abundance of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells.\nDespite these conundrums, there were early signs that CD8+ T cells play a role in controlling HIV disease progression. Sequencing of autologous virus from infected persons revealed evidence of immune selection pressure mediated by these responses (Phillips et al. 1991) and an association with the initial decline in peak viremia after acute infection (Borrow et al. 1994; Koup et al. 1994). The development of HLA-class I-peptide tetramers confirmed the presence of robust induction of responses to multiple epitopes (Altman et al. 1996), and as larger numbers of patients were studied, it also became clear that among the strongest associations with disease outcome was the expression of certain HLA class I alleles (Kaslow et al. 1996; Migueles et al. 2000; Gao et al. 2001), implicating class I restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) as a major modulator of disease progression. The relationship between CD8+ T-cell immune function and viral control was shown by experimental depletion of CD8+ T cells in animal models of AIDS virus infection (Jin et al. 1999; Schmitz et al. 1999). As sensitive viral load assays became available, it also became clear that some infected persons were able to control viremia to levels below detection by the most sensitive RNA assays, and that these persons were characterized by robust HIV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses (Rosenberg et al. 1997). However, now a quarter century into the epidemic the precise role of T cells in HIV control, and the precise phenotype, specificity and function of T cells that should be induced with a vaccine, remain unclear. And from the standpoint of vaccine development, it remains controversial as to how much insight is to be gained from the study of persons who have become infected, because by definition these are not protective responses.\nAcute HIV infection is often associated with a transient febrile illness, much like infectious mononucleosis (Ho et al. 1985), which has facilitated the identification of persons in the earliest stages of infection, who are HIV RNA positive but not yet HIV antibody positive. Important justification for the intense study of acute infection is the demonstration that early events predict subsequent disease progression (Mellors et al. 1996; Lyles et al. 2000). Acute infection is associated with a decline in peak viremia from \u223c1\u20135 million viral copies/mL to a steady state of \u223c30,000 copies (Lyles et al. 2000), but peak levels of viremia may be much lower in asymptomatic persons (Fiebig et al. 2003). Very few studies have actually examined CD8+ T-cell responses in the earliest stages of infection (Fiebig stage I and II), but when those studies have been performed it is clear that initial immune responses are very narrowly directed (Goonetilleke et al. 2009) and remain narrowly directed as viral set point is achieved (Dalod et al. 1999; Altfeld et al. 2001). Even when responses to autologous virus are measured, the initial detectable response has usually been to only one to three epitopes (Goonetilleke et al. 2009), even though the autologou\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

HIV infects and destroys cells of your immune system, making it hard to fight off other diseases. When HIV has severely weakened your immune system, it can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\nBecause HIV works backward to insert its instructions into your DNA, it is called a retrovirus.\nAIDS is the final and most serious stage of an HIV infection. People with AIDS have very low counts of certain white blood cells and severely damaged immune systems. They may have additional illnesses that indicate that they have progressed to AIDS.\nWithout treatment, HIV infections progress to AIDS in about 10 years.\nThe difference between HIV and AIDS is that HIV is a virus that weakens your immune system. AIDS is a condition that can happen as a result of an HIV infection when your immune system is severely weakened.\nYou can\u2019t get AIDS if you aren\u2019t infected with HIV. Thanks to treatment that slows down the effects of the virus, not everyone with HIV progresses to AIDS. But without treatment, almost all people living with HIV will advance to AIDS.\nHIV infects white blood cells of your immune system called CD4 cells, or helper T cells. It destroys CD4 cells, causing your white blood cell count to drop. This leaves you with an immune system that can\u2019t fight off infections, even those that wouldn\u2019t normally make you sick.\nHIV initially makes you feel sick with flu-like symptoms. Then it can hide in your body for a long time without causing noticeable symptoms. During that time, it slowly destroys your T-cells. When your T-cells get very low or you begin to get certain illnesses that people with healthy immune systems don\u2019t get, HIV has progressed to AIDS.\nAIDS can cause rapid weight loss, extreme tiredness, mouth or genital ulcers, fevers, night sweats and skin discolorations. Other illnesses and cancers often happen in people living with AIDS and can cause additional symptoms.\nA retrovirus is a virus that works backward from the way human cells do. Human cells have instructions (DNA) that send a message (RNA) to make building blocks for your body (proteins).\nRetroviruses have their instructions written on RNA. When a retrovirus invades your cells, it changes its RNA to look like your cells\u2019 instructions (DNA). Then it cuts your cells\u2019 DNA and inserts its instructions into them. Your cell then acts as though the virus\u2019 instructions are its own.\nHIV is a retrovirus. All viruses invade your cells and then use your cells\u2019 \u201cmachinery\u201d to make more copies of themselves. HIV not only uses your cells to make more of itself, but it also inserts its instructions into your DNA.\nIt\u2019s a myth that HIV only infects certain people. Anyone can get HIV if they\u2019re exposed to the virus. Having sex without a condom or sharing needles to inject drugs are the most common ways that HIV spreads.\nSome populations are statistically more affected by HIV than others. Groups disproportionately affected by HIV include:\nWhile these aren\u2019t the only populations impacted by HIV, it\u2019s important to consider that they face unique barriers to accessing preventative care, getting tested, and receiving comprehensive treatment. Social stigmas around HIV continue to drive barriers and keep people from accessing high-quality healthcare.\nThe number of new HIV infections has declined. In 2019, 1.2 million people in the US were living with HIV. About 13% of those don\u2019t know they have it, which is why routine testing for HIV is important.\nYou can have HIV without having any symptoms. This is why it\u2019s important to get tested even if you don\u2019t feel sick.\nSometimes you\u2019ll have flu-like symptoms when you first get infected with HIV. These can include:\nHIV has three stages:\nSome people get flu-like symptoms a month or two after they\u2019ve been infected with HIV. These symptoms often go away within a week to a month.\nAfter the acute stage, you can have HIV for many years without feeling sick. It's important to know that you can still spread HIV to others even if you feel well.\nAIDS is the most serious stage of HIV infection. In this stage, HIV has severely weakened your immune system and opportunistic infections are much more likely to make you sick.\nOpportunistic infections are ones that someone with a healthy immune system could typically fight off. When HIV has advanced to AIDS, these illnesses take advantage of your weakened immune system.\nYou\u2019re more likely to get certain cancers when you have AIDS. These cancers and opportunistic infections together are called AIDS-defining illnesses.\nTo be diagnosed with AIDS, you must be infected with HIV and have at least one of the following:\nAIDS-defining illnesses are opportunistic infections, certain cancers (usually caused by viruses) and some neurological conditions.

Human cells have instructions (DNA) that send a message (RNA) to make building blocks for your body (proteins).\nRetroviruses have their instructions written on RNA. When a retrovirus invades your cells, it changes its RNA to look like your cells\u2019 instructions (DNA). Then it cuts your cells\u2019 DNA and inserts its instructions into them. Your cell then acts as though the virus\u2019 instructions are its own.\nHIV is a retrovirus. All viruses invade your cells and then use your cells\u2019 \u201cmachinery\u201d to make more copies of themselves. HIV not only uses your cells to make more of itself, but it also inserts its instructions into your DNA.\nIt\u2019s a myth that HIV only infects certain people. Anyone can get HIV if they\u2019re exposed to the virus. Having sex without a condom or sharing needles to inject drugs are the most common ways that HIV spreads.\nSome populations are statistically more affected by HIV than others. Groups disproportionately affected by HIV include:\nWhile these aren\u2019t the only populations impacted by HIV, it\u2019s important to consider that they face unique barriers to accessing preventative care, getting tested, and receiving comprehensive treatment. Social stigmas around HIV continue to drive barriers and keep people from accessing high-quality healthcare.\nThe number of new HIV infections has declined. In 2019, 1.2 million people in the US were living with HIV. About 13% of those don\u2019t know they have it, which is why routine testing for HIV is important.\nYou can have HIV without having any symptoms. This is why it\u2019s important to get tested even if you don\u2019t feel sick.\nSometimes you\u2019ll have flu-like symptoms when you first get infected with HIV. These can include:\nHIV has three stages:\nSome people get flu-like symptoms a month or two after they\u2019ve been infected with HIV. These symptoms often go away within a week to a month.\nAfter the acute stage, you can have HIV for many years without feeling sick. It's important to know that you can still spread HIV to others even if you feel well.\nAIDS is the most serious stage of HIV infection. In this stage, HIV has severely weakened your immune system and opportunistic infections are much more likely to make you sick.\nOpportunistic infections are ones that someone with a healthy immune system could typically fight off. When HIV has advanced to AIDS, these illnesses take advantage of your weakened immune system.\nYou\u2019re more likely to get certain cancers when you have AIDS. These cancers and opportunistic infections together are called AIDS-defining illnesses.\nTo be diagnosed with AIDS, you must be infected with HIV and have at least one of the following:\nAIDS-defining illnesses are opportunistic infections, certain cancers (usually caused by viruses) and some neurological conditions. They include:\nSymptoms of AIDS can be caused by HIV infection, but many are from illnesses that take advantage of your weakened immune system.\nHIV is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus. The virus attacks the helper T-cells of your immune system, leaving it weakened.\nAIDS is caused by having too few immune cells to fight off other illnesses.\nYou can get HIV through the blood, semen, vaginal fluids, breast milk and rectal fluids of an infected person. People of all sexes and sexual orientations can get infected with and spread HIV.\nThe virus can enter your body through your mouth, anus, penis, vagin\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

LevyAUTHORS INFO & AFFILIATIONS https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01939-13 CITE PDF/EPUB Information & Contributors Metrics & Citations References Figures Tables Media Share ABSTRACT Integration is a central event in the replication of retroviruses, yet \u226590% of HIV-1 reverse transcripts fail to integrate, resulting in accumulation of unintegrated viral DNA in cells. However, understanding what role, if any, unintegrated viral DNA plays in the natural history of HIV-1 has remained elusive. Unintegrated HIV-1 DNA is reported to possess a limited capacity for gene expression restricted to early gene products and is considered a replicative dead end. Although the majority of peripheral blood CD4+ T cells are refractory to infection, nonactivated CD4 T cells present in lymphoid and mucosal tissues are major targets for infection. Treatment with cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-7, or IL-15 renders CD4+ T cells permissive to HIV-1 infection in the absence of cell activation and proliferation and provides a useful model for infection of resting CD4+ T cells. We found that infection of cytokine-treated resting CD4+ T cells in the presence of raltegravir or with integrase active-site mutant HIV-1 yielded de novo virus production following subsequent T cell activation. Infection with integration-competent HIV-1 naturally generated a population of cells generating virus from unintegrated DNA. Latent infection persisted for several weeks and could be activated to virus production by a combination of a histone deacetylase inhibitor and a protein kinase C activator or by T cell activation. HIV-1 Vpr was essential for unintegrated HIV-1 gene expression and de novo virus production in this system. Bypassing integration by this mechanism may allow the preservation of genetic information that otherwise would be lost. INTRODUCTION As for all retroviruses, integration of the newly reverse transcribed human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) cDNA genome into the host cell's DNA has been observed to be an essential replicative step, with the integrated provirus being the exclusive template for all de novo virus production (1, 2). Integration is mediated by the viral integrase enzyme, which is a product of the pol gene and the target of the recently developed and highly successful integrase inhibitor class of antiretrovirals (3). Since the integrated provirus will remain for the life of the infected cell and its descendants, integration is a major factor in HIV-1 persistence (4, 5). Interestingly, irrespective of the activation status of the infected CD4+ T cell, \u226590% of HIV-1 reverse transcripts fail to integrate in vivo and in vitro (6\u201310). In vivo, this inefficiency of integration results in an accumulation of unintegrated HIV-1 DNA (uDNA) in blood CD4+ T cells and monocytes (7, 8, 11, 12), as well as in lymphoid tissue (8\u201310), brain (13, 14), and untreated patients with high or low viral loads (15, 16). During untreated chronic infection, the majority of infected cells have been reported to contain only unintegrated HIV-1 DNA (7). However, it remains unclear whether unintegrated DNA plays any functional role in the natural history of HIV-1 (17, 18). If the linear cDNA product of reverse transcription fails to integrate, it can be degraded or become circularized. Linear unintegrated HIV-1 DNA, one-long-terminal-repeat (1-LTR) circles, and 2-LTR circles are all capable of limited transcription (17, 19\u201321), which can enhance T cell activation (22). Intriguingly, it has been reported that similar numbers of integrated and unintegrated HIV-1 templates transcribe RNA (23). It is generally observed that uDNA gene expression is higher in nonproliferating cells than in proliferating cells, perhaps owing to a lack of dilution of uDNA templates and their RNA and protein products (17, 24\u201327). The virion-associated Vpr protein transactivates uDNA, enhancing expression of early viral proteins in infected activated CD4+ T cells (28, 29). Vpr has several other activities (30\u201333), including the ability to arrest cell proliferation (34) in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (35, 36), which is favorable to HIV-1 transcription (37, 38), as well as the capacity to enhance HIV-1 replication in nonproliferating cells (33, 39, 40), at least in part through assisting with viral nuclear import (30, 41, 42). Primate immunodeficiency viruses replicate most efficiently in activated CD4+ T cells, which generate the majority of virions in vivo (43, 44). Resting CD4+ T cells derived from peripheral blood are refractory to productive infection (7, 45\u201348) but can be rendered permissive to productive infection by common gamma-chain cytokines, including interlukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-7, and IL-15, without inducing activation or activation-induced proliferation (49\u201351). During early HIV-1 infection in humans and acute simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of rhesus macaques, many viral RNA-positive cells lack activation and proliferation markers and thus resemble resting CD4+ T cells (52\u201358). Infected nonactivated, nonproliferating CD4+ T cells have been identified in high numbers near the sites of mucosal transmission (53, 57) and in lymphoid tissues (59) and are observed after ex vivo infection of lymphoid histocultures (55, 60\u201363). These findings indicate that local environmental factors, such as common gamma-chain cytokines, contribute\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

They may have additional illnesses that indicate that they have progressed to AIDS.\nWithout treatment, HIV infections progress to AIDS in about 10 years.\nThe difference between HIV and AIDS is that HIV is a virus that weakens your immune system. AIDS is a condition that can happen as a result of an HIV infection when your immune system is severely weakened.\nYou can\u2019t get AIDS if you aren\u2019t infected with HIV. Thanks to treatment that slows down the effects of the virus, not everyone with HIV progresses to AIDS. But without treatment, almost all people living with HIV will advance to AIDS.\nHIV infects white blood cells of your immune system called CD4 cells, or helper T cells. It destroys CD4 cells, causing your white blood cell count to drop. This leaves you with an immune system that can\u2019t fight off infections, even those that wouldn\u2019t normally make you sick.\nHIV initially makes you feel sick with flu-like symptoms. Then it can hide in your body for a long time without causing noticeable symptoms. During that time, it slowly destroys your T-cells. When your T-cells get very low or you begin to get certain illnesses that people with healthy immune systems don\u2019t get, HIV has progressed to AIDS.\nAIDS can cause rapid weight loss, extreme tiredness, mouth or genital ulcers, fevers, night sweats and skin discolorations. Other illnesses and cancers often happen in people living with AIDS and can cause additional symptoms.\nA retrovirus is a virus that works backward from the way human cells do. Human cells have instructions (DNA) that send a message (RNA) to make building blocks for your body (proteins).\nRetroviruses have their instructions written on RNA. When a retrovirus invades your cells, it changes its RNA to look like your cells\u2019 instructions (DNA). Then it cuts your cells\u2019 DNA and inserts its instructions into them. Your cell then acts as though the virus\u2019 instructions are its own.\nHIV is a retrovirus. All viruses invade your cells and then use your cells\u2019 \u201cmachinery\u201d to make more copies of themselves. HIV not only uses your cells to make more of itself, but it also inserts its instructions into your DNA.\nIt\u2019s a myth that HIV only infects certain people. Anyone can get HIV if they\u2019re exposed to the virus. Having sex without a condom or sharing needles to inject drugs are the most common ways that HIV spreads.\nSome populations are statistically more affected by HIV than others. Groups disproportionately affected by HIV include:\nWhile these aren\u2019t the only populations impacted by HIV, it\u2019s important to consider that they face unique barriers to accessing preventative care, getting tested, and receiving comprehensive treatment. Social stigmas around HIV continue to drive barriers and keep people from accessing high-quality healthcare.\nThe number of new HIV infections has declined. In 2019, 1.2 million people in the US were living with HIV. About 13% of those don\u2019t know they have it, which is why routine testing for HIV is important.\nYou can have HIV without having any symptoms. This is why it\u2019s important to get tested even if you don\u2019t feel sick.\nSometimes you\u2019ll have flu-like symptoms when you first get infected with HIV. These can include:\nHIV has three stages:\nSome people get flu-like symptoms a month or two after they\u2019ve been infected with HIV. These symptoms often go away within a week to a month.\nAfter the acute stage, you can have HIV for many years without feeling sick. It's important to know that you can still spread HIV to others even if you feel well.\nAIDS is the most serious stage of HIV infection. In this stage, HIV has severely weakened your immune system and opportunistic infections are much more likely to make you sick.\nOpportunistic infections are ones that someone with a healthy immune system could typically fight off. When HIV has advanced to AIDS, these illnesses take advantage of your weakened immune system.\nYou\u2019re more likely to get certain cancers when you have AIDS. These cancers and opportunistic infections together are called AIDS-defining illnesses.\nTo be diagnosed with AIDS, you must be infected with HIV and have at least one of the following:\nAIDS-defining illnesses are opportunistic infections, certain cancers (usually caused by viruses) and some neurological conditions. They include:\nSymptoms of AIDS can be caused by HIV infection, but many are from illnesses that take advantage of your weakened immune system.\nHIV is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus. The virus attacks the helper T-cells of your immune system, leaving it weakened.\nAIDS is caused by having too few immune cells to fight off other illnesses.\nYou can get HIV through the blood, semen, vaginal fluids, breast milk and rectal fluids of an infected person. People of all sexes and sexual orientations can get infected with and spread HIV.\nThe virus can enter your body through your mouth, anus, penis, vagin\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

LevyAUTHORS INFO & AFFILIATIONS https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01939-13 CITE PDF/EPUB Information & Contributors Metrics & Citations References Figures Tables Media Share ABSTRACT Integration is a central event in the replication of retroviruses, yet \u226590% of HIV-1 reverse transcripts fail to integrate, resulting in accumulation of unintegrated viral DNA in cells. However, understanding what role, if any, unintegrated viral DNA plays in the natural history of HIV-1 has remained elusive. Unintegrated HIV-1 DNA is reported to possess a limited capacity for gene expression restricted to early gene products and is considered a replicative dead end. Although the majority of peripheral blood CD4+ T cells are refractory to infection, nonactivated CD4 T cells present in lymphoid and mucosal tissues are major targets for infection. Treatment with cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-7, or IL-15 renders CD4+ T cells permissive to HIV-1 infection in the absence of cell activation and proliferation and provides a useful model for infection of resting CD4+ T cells. We found that infection of cytokine-treated resting CD4+ T cells in the presence of raltegravir or with integrase active-site mutant HIV-1 yielded de novo virus production following subsequent T cell activation. Infection with integration-competent HIV-1 naturally generated a population of cells generating virus from unintegrated DNA. Latent infection persisted for several weeks and could be activated to virus production by a combination of a histone deacetylase inhibitor and a protein kinase C activator or by T cell activation. HIV-1 Vpr was essential for unintegrated HIV-1 gene expression and de novo virus production in this system. Bypassing integration by this mechanism may allow the preservation of genetic information that otherwise would be lost. INTRODUCTION As for all retroviruses, integration of the newly reverse transcribed human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) cDNA genome into the host cell's DNA has been observed to be an essential replicative step, with the integrated provirus being the exclusive template for all de novo virus production (1, 2). Integration is mediated by the viral integrase enzyme, which is a product of the pol gene and the target of the recently developed and highly successful integrase inhibitor class of antiretrovirals (3). Since the integrated provirus will remain for the life of the infected cell and its descendants, integration is a major factor in HIV-1 persistence (4, 5). Interestingly, irrespective of the activation status of the infected CD4+ T cell, \u226590% of HIV-1 reverse transcripts fail to integrate in vivo and in vitro (6\u201310). In vivo, this inefficiency of integration results in an accumulation of unintegrated HIV-1 DNA (uDNA) in blood CD4+ T cells and monocytes (7, 8, 11, 12), as well as in lymphoid tissue (8\u201310), brain (13, 14), and untreated patients with high or low viral loads (15, 16). During untreated chronic infection, the majority of infected cells have been reported to contain only unintegrated HIV-1 DNA (7). However, it remains unclear whether unintegrated DNA plays any functional role in the natural history of HIV-1 (17, 18). If the linear cDNA product of reverse transcription fails to integrate, it can be degraded or become circularized. Linear unintegrated HIV-1 DNA, one-long-terminal-repeat (1-LTR) circles, and 2-LTR circles are all capable of limited transcription (17, 19\u201321), which can enhance T cell activation (22). Intriguingly, it has been reported that similar numbers of integrated and unintegrated HIV-1 templates transcribe RNA (23). It is generally observed that uDNA gene expression is higher in nonproliferating cells than in proliferating cells, perhaps owing to a lack of dilution of uDNA templates and their RNA and protein products (17, 24\u201327). The virion-associated Vpr protein transactivates uDNA, enhancing expression of early viral proteins in infected activated CD4+ T cells (28, 29). Vpr has several other activities (30\u201333), including the ability to arrest cell proliferation (34) in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (35, 36), which is favorable to HIV-1 transcription (37, 38), as well as the capacity to enhance HIV-1 replication in nonproliferating cells (33, 39, 40), at least in part through assisting with viral nuclear import (30, 41, 42). Primate immunodeficiency viruses replicate most efficiently in activated CD4+ T cells, which generate the majority of virions in vivo (43, 44). Resting CD4+ T cells derived from peripheral blood are refractory to productive infection (7, 45\u201348) but can be rendered permissive to productive infection by common gamma-chain cytokines, including interlukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-7, and IL-15, without inducing activation or activation-induced proliferation (49\u201351). During early HIV-1 infection in humans and acute simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of rhesus macaques, many viral RNA-positive cells lack activation and proliferation markers and thus resemble resting CD4+ T cells (52\u201358). Infected nonactivated, nonproliferating CD4+ T cells have been identified in high numbers near the sites of mucosal transmission (53, 57) and in lymphoid tissues (59) and are observed after ex vivo infection of lymphoid histocultures (55, 60\u201363). These findings indicate that local environmental factors, such as common gamma-chain cytokines, contribute\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Treatment with antiretroviral drugs is remarkably effective at suppressing replication of the virus, and most individuals who take antiretroviral drugs are able to reduce the amount of HIV circulating in their bloodstream to undetectable levels. However, this treatment cannot eliminate a small but stubborn population of infected white blood cells that contain a copy of the virus's genetic material within their own genomes. These cells can persist in the body for life, and they allow the virus to re-emerge and ignite new rounds of infection if antiretroviral therapy (or ART) is ever interrupted. Eliminating these cells is the focus of an emerging global effort aimed at finding a cure for HIV disease.\nIn order to eradicate these cells, we first need to be able to measure them accurately. Most people on long-term ART have about 10\u20131000 copies of HIV DNA per million white blood cells that can be infected by the virus (Eriksson et al., 2013). However, most of this \u2018total HIV DNA\u2019 is defective and cannot trigger new infections (See Figure 1A). The rare cells that appear to contain intact copies of the virus, which are able to replicate, are referred to as the \u2018latent reservoir\u2019. Moreover, only a fraction of the cells in the latent reservoir can be induced to produce new viruses in cell culture experiments (Ho et al., 2013). Developing a high-throughput method for measuring the size of the latent reservoir will therefore require us to identify a specific molecule (or biomarker) that distinguishes the cells in the reservoir from other infected cells. In the absence of such a method, the only way to currently determine if an intervention has effectively cured a patient, and reduced or eliminated the reservoir, is to interrupt therapy under the supervision of a physician and wait until the virus re-emerges or \u2018rebounds\u2019 (Figure 1B). This approach clearly carries some risk to the patient (and his or her sexual partners) and is logistically challenging.\nIdentifying a biomarker for the latent reservoir of HIV could be used to guide future clinical trials. (A) Much of the HIV DNA harboured by infected cells is defective and cannot replicate itself, \u2026 see more\nNow, in eLife, John Frater at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford and co-workers in the SPARTAC collaboration report an important advance in the search for a biomarker for the latent reservoir. The SPARTAC study enrolled a cohort of individuals infected with HIV who were identified during the early stages of their infection. Subjects were randomly selected to receive either antiretroviral therapy for several weeks before the therapy was stopped, or no antiretroviral therapy (which is the standard course of action for an early HIV infection). This study aimed to determine if short-term ART during an early infection preserves the function of the immune system and eventually allows individuals to stop therapy safely. As previously reported (Fidler et al., 2013), the SPARTAC group found that this was not the case, and concluded that once ART is initiated it should not be interrupted.\nA cure\u2014or more accurately remission (a temporary end of disease symptoms)\u2014will likely be defined based on how long a person remains free from replicating HIV in the absence of therapy. It is logical to predict that the smaller the HIV reservoir during ART, the longer it will take for the virus to rebound after the treatment is stopped (Hill et al., 2014): this idea is also supported by recent clinical experience (Yukl et al., 2013; Henrich et al., 2014; Persaud et al., 2013). A test that is inexpensive, sensitive and reproducible, and that accurately reflects the total amount of replication-competent HIV, would therefore have profound effects on cure research\u2014particularly if it could predict what would happen if therapy were interrupted. Finding a biomarker that achieves all of this would allow investigators to perform efficient proof-of-concept studies and allow regulators to guide companies through the drug development process. Such a development would be comparable to the tremendous advances in antiviral therapies that were enabled by developing the HIV plasma viral load test, which measures how much virus is circulating in the bloodstream.\nOne way to estimate the size of the HIV latent reservoir would be to measure how many cells contain HIV DNA. In the SPARTAC study, Frater and co-workers\u2014who include James Williams and Jacob Hurst as joint first authors\u2014measured the frequency of certain white blood cells (the CD4+ T cells) that harbour HIV DNA (that is, the \u2018total HIV DNA\u2019) in all the participants at the start of the trial. Even though it is well recognised that most HIV DNA is defective and unable to support replication, the total DNA in early untreated HIV infection could predict how the disease would progress (Williams et al., 2014). The total DNA declined by several fold during the course of ART, as expected. The total DNA prior to stopping ART also predicted how quickly the number of CD4+ T cells would decline and how quickly the virus would rebound. Those patients with high levels of total DNA had over double the rate of viral rebound as individuals with low levels of total DNA. Total HIV DNA levels can thus predict how long a patient can safely remain off treatment, and may prove to be useful in monitoring potential cure treatments (Figure 1C). Studies to confirm these observations are now being planned.\nDeveloping and evaluating possible HIV cures faces many challenges beyond how best to measure the reservoir. Nevertheless, there are now many interventions that might provide a cure, including early ART (Persaud et al., 2013; Saez-Cirion et al., 2013) and drugs that essentially shock the virus out of hiding (Archin et al., 2012). Other possible cures include gene therapies (Tebas et al., 2014), stem cell transplantation (Hutter et al., 2009; He\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

However, understanding what role, if any, unintegrated viral DNA plays in the natural history of HIV-1 has remained elusive. Unintegrated HIV-1 DNA is reported to possess a limited capacity for gene expression restricted to early gene products and is considered a replicative dead end. Although the majority of peripheral blood CD4+ T cells are refractory to infection, nonactivated CD4 T cells present in lymphoid and mucosal tissues are major targets for infection. Treatment with cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-7, or IL-15 renders CD4+ T cells permissive to HIV-1 infection in the absence of cell activation and proliferation and provides a useful model for infection of resting CD4+ T cells. We found that infection of cytokine-treated resting CD4+ T cells in the presence of raltegravir or with integrase active-site mutant HIV-1 yielded de novo virus production following subsequent T cell activation. Infection with integration-competent HIV-1 naturally generated a population of cells generating virus from unintegrated DNA. Latent infection persisted for several weeks and could be activated to virus production by a combination of a histone deacetylase inhibitor and a protein kinase C activator or by T cell activation. HIV-1 Vpr was essential for unintegrated HIV-1 gene expression and de novo virus production in this system. Bypassing integration by this mechanism may allow the preservation of genetic information that otherwise would be lost. INTRODUCTION As for all retroviruses, integration of the newly reverse transcribed human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) cDNA genome into the host cell's DNA has been observed to be an essential replicative step, with the integrated provirus being the exclusive template for all de novo virus production (1, 2). Integration is mediated by the viral integrase enzyme, which is a product of the pol gene and the target of the recently developed and highly successful integrase inhibitor class of antiretrovirals (3). Since the integrated provirus will remain for the life of the infected cell and its descendants, integration is a major factor in HIV-1 persistence (4, 5). Interestingly, irrespective of the activation status of the infected CD4+ T cell, \u226590% of HIV-1 reverse transcripts fail to integrate in vivo and in vitro (6\u201310). In vivo, this inefficiency of integration results in an accumulation of unintegrated HIV-1 DNA (uDNA) in blood CD4+ T cells and monocytes (7, 8, 11, 12), as well as in lymphoid tissue (8\u201310), brain (13, 14), and untreated patients with high or low viral loads (15, 16). During untreated chronic infection, the majority of infected cells have been reported to contain only unintegrated HIV-1 DNA (7). However, it remains unclear whether unintegrated DNA plays any functional role in the natural history of HIV-1 (17, 18). If the linear cDNA product of reverse transcription fails to integrate, it can be degraded or become circularized. Linear unintegrated HIV-1 DNA, one-long-terminal-repeat (1-LTR) circles, and 2-LTR circles are all capable of limited transcription (17, 19\u201321), which can enhance T cell activation (22). Intriguingly, it has been reported that similar numbers of integrated and unintegrated HIV-1 templates transcribe RNA (23). It is generally observed that uDNA gene expression is higher in nonproliferating cells than in proliferating cells, perhaps owing to a lack of dilution of uDNA templates and their RNA and protein products (17, 24\u201327). The virion-associated Vpr protein transactivates uDNA, enhancing expression of early viral proteins in infected activated CD4+ T cells (28, 29). Vpr has several other activities (30\u201333), including the ability to arrest cell proliferation (34) in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (35, 36), which is favorable to HIV-1 transcription (37, 38), as well as the capacity to enhance HIV-1 replication in nonproliferating cells (33, 39, 40), at least in part through assisting with viral nuclear import (30, 41, 42). Primate immunodeficiency viruses replicate most efficiently in activated CD4+ T cells, which generate the majority of virions in vivo (43, 44). Resting CD4+ T cells derived from peripheral blood are refractory to productive infection (7, 45\u201348) but can be rendered permissive to productive infection by common gamma-chain cytokines, including interlukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-7, and IL-15, without inducing activation or activation-induced proliferation (49\u201351). During early HIV-1 infection in humans and acute simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of rhesus macaques, many viral RNA-positive cells lack activation and proliferation markers and thus resemble resting CD4+ T cells (52\u201358). Infected nonactivated, nonproliferating CD4+ T cells have been identified in high numbers near the sites of mucosal transmission (53, 57) and in lymphoid tissues (59) and are observed after ex vivo infection of lymphoid histocultures (55, 60\u201363). These findings indicate that local environmental factors, such as common gamma-chain cytokines, contribute\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

HIV infects and deletes CD4+ T cells that normally coordinate the adaptive T- and B-cell response to defend against intracellular pathogens. The immune defect is immediate and profound: At the time of acute infection with an AIDS virus, typically more than half of the gut-associated CD4+ T cells are depleted, leaving a damaged immune system to contend with a life-long infection.\nAt the time of acute HIV infection, more than half of the gut-associated CD4+ T cells are depleted, leaving a damaged immune system to contend with a life-long infection.\nThe earliest studies of T-cell function among infected persons revealed aspects of HIV immunopathogenesis that are still not fully understood. Despite initial and persistent damage to CD4+ T cells, and a lack of detectable HIV-specific CD4+ T helper cells (Murray et al. 1984; Lane et al. 1985), the magnitude and breadth of CD8+ T-cell responses to HIV in infected humans were found to be robust, with direct effector function of such a magnitude that it could be readily detected in freshly isolated lymphocytes from peripheral blood and brochoalveolar lavage in persons with AIDS (Plata et al. 1987; Walker et al. 1987; Nixon et al. 1988). HIV was already known to be an immunosuppressive disease, yet these cells were present in such robust quantity that they could be detected by assays measuring the ability of freshly isolated peripheral blood cells to lyse autologous B cells infected with recombinant vaccinia-HIV vectors or peptide pulsed targets (Walker et al. 1987; Nixon et al. 1988). Moreover, CD8+ T cells from infected persons were able to inhibit HIV replication (Walker et al. 1986), clearly showing that these cells were functional at least in vitro, but despite this, persons were progressing to AIDS.\nSubsequent studies using other approaches such as interferon \u03b3 Elispot (Dalod et al. 1999), intracellular cytokine (Maecker et al. 2001), and peptide MHC tetramer assays (Altman et al. 1996) confirmed and quantified these robust CD8+ T-cell responses. Most chronically infected persons target more than a dozen CD8+ epitopes simultaneously (Addo et al. 2003), and in some instances up to 19% of CD8+ T cells are specific for HIV (Richardson 2000; Betts et al. 2001; Papagno et al. 2002), yet control of viremia is not achieved. At the same time, HIV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses were found to be severely impaired, particularly as measured by the ability of these cells to proliferate to viral antigens (Wahren et al. 1987). Thus, from the early studies there was a clear disconnect between the lack of HIV-specific CD4+ T cells and the abundance of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells.\nDespite these conundrums, there were early signs that CD8+ T cells play a role in controlling HIV disease progression. Sequencing of autologous virus from infected persons revealed evidence of immune selection pressure mediated by these responses (Phillips et al. 1991) and an association with the initial decline in peak viremia after acute infection (Borrow et al. 1994; Koup et al. 1994). The development of HLA-class I-peptide tetramers confirmed the presence of robust induction of responses to multiple epitopes (Altman et al. 1996), and as larger numbers of patients were studied, it also became clear that among the strongest associations with disease outcome was the expression of certain HLA class I alleles (Kaslow et al. 1996; Migueles et al. 2000; Gao et al. 2001), implicating class I restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) as a major modulator of disease progression. The relationship between CD8+ T-cell immune function and viral control was shown by experimental depletion of CD8+ T cells in animal models of AIDS virus infection (Jin et al. 1999; Schmitz et al. 1999). As sensitive viral load assays became available, it also became clear that some infected persons were able to control viremia to levels below detection by the most sensitive RNA assays, and that these persons were characterized by robust HIV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses (Rosenberg et al. 1997). However, now a quarter century into the epidemic the precise role of T cells in HIV control, and the precise phenotype, specificity and function of T cells that should be induced with a vaccine, remain unclear. And from the standpoint of vaccine development, it remains controversial as to how much insight is to be gained from the study of persons who have become infected, because by definition these are not protective responses.\nAcute HIV infection is often associated with a transient febrile illness, much like infectious mononucleosis (Ho et al. 1985), which has facilitated the identification of persons in the earliest stages of infection, who are HIV RNA positive but not yet HIV antibody positive. Important justification for the intense study of acute infection is the demonstration that early events predict subsequent disease progression (Mellors et al. 1996; Lyles et al. 2000). Acute infection is associated with a decline in peak viremia from \u223c1\u20135 million viral copies/mL to a steady state of \u223c30,000 copies (Lyles et al. 2000), but peak levels of viremia may be much lower in asymptomatic persons (Fiebig et al. 2003). Very few studies have actually examined CD8+ T-cell responses in the earliest stages of infection (Fiebig stage I and II), but when those studies have been performed it is clear that initial immune responses are very narrowly directed (Goonetilleke et al. 2009) and remain narrowly directed as viral set point is achieved (Dalod et al. 1999; Altfeld et al. 2001). Even when responses to autologous virus are measured, the initial detectable response has usually been to only one to three epitopes (Goonetilleke et al. 2009), even though the autologou\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

HIV infects and destroys cells of your immune system, making it hard to fight off other diseases. When HIV has severely weakened your immune system, it can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\nBecause HIV works backward to insert its instructions into your DNA, it is called a retrovirus.\nAIDS is the final and most serious stage of an HIV infection. People with AIDS have very low counts of certain white blood cells and severely damaged immune systems. They may have additional illnesses that indicate that they have progressed to AIDS.\nWithout treatment, HIV infections progress to AIDS in about 10 years.\nThe difference between HIV and AIDS is that HIV is a virus that weakens your immune system. AIDS is a condition that can happen as a result of an HIV infection when your immune system is severely weakened.\nYou can\u2019t get AIDS if you aren\u2019t infected with HIV. Thanks to treatment that slows down the effects of the virus, not everyone with HIV progresses to AIDS. But without treatment, almost all people living with HIV will advance to AIDS.\nHIV infects white blood cells of your immune system called CD4 cells, or helper T cells. It destroys CD4 cells, causing your white blood cell count to drop. This leaves you with an immune system that can\u2019t fight off infections, even those that wouldn\u2019t normally make you sick.\nHIV initially makes you feel sick with flu-like symptoms. Then it can hide in your body for a long time without causing noticeable symptoms. During that time, it slowly destroys your T-cells. When your T-cells get very low or you begin to get certain illnesses that people with healthy immune systems don\u2019t get, HIV has progressed to AIDS.\nAIDS can cause rapid weight loss, extreme tiredness, mouth or genital ulcers, fevers, night sweats and skin discolorations. Other illnesses and cancers often happen in people living with AIDS and can cause additional symptoms.\nA retrovirus is a virus that works backward from the way human cells do. Human cells have instructions (DNA) that send a message (RNA) to make building blocks for your body (proteins).\nRetroviruses have their instructions written on RNA. When a retrovirus invades your cells, it changes its RNA to look like your cells\u2019 instructions (DNA). Then it cuts your cells\u2019 DNA and inserts its instructions into them. Your cell then acts as though the virus\u2019 instructions are its own.\nHIV is a retrovirus. All viruses invade your cells and then use your cells\u2019 \u201cmachinery\u201d to make more copies of themselves. HIV not only uses your cells to make more of itself, but it also inserts its instructions into your DNA.\nIt\u2019s a myth that HIV only infects certain people.

HIV weakens your immune system by destroying your T-cells until you are unable to fight off even minor illnesses. You can have HIV without any symptoms. Getting tested and starting treatment early gives you the best chance of living a long life.\nADVERTISEMENT\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

Policy\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nHIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. HIV infects and destroys cells of your immune system, making it hard to fight off other diseases. When HIV has severely weakened your immune system, it can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\nBecause HIV works backward to insert its instructions into your DNA, it is called a retrovirus.\nAIDS is the final and most serious stage of an HIV infection. People with AIDS have very low counts of certain white blood cells and severely damaged immune systems. They may have additional illnesses that indicate that they have progressed to AIDS.\nWithout treatment, HIV infections progress to AIDS in about 10 years.\nThe difference between HIV and AIDS is that HIV is a virus that weakens your immune system. AIDS is a condition that can happen as a result of an HIV infection when your immune system is severely weakened.\nYou can\u2019t get AIDS if you aren\u2019t infected with HIV. Thanks to treatment that slows down the effects of the virus, not everyone with HIV progresses to AIDS. But without treatment, almost all people living with HIV will advance to AIDS.\nHIV infects white blood cells of your immune system called CD4 cells, or helper T cells. It destroys CD4 cells, causing your white blood cell count to drop. This leaves you with an immune system that can\u2019t fight off infections, even those that wouldn\u2019t normally make you sick.\nHIV initially makes you feel sick with flu-like symptoms. Then it can hide in your body for a long time without causing noticeable symptoms. During that time, it slowly destroys your T-cells. When your T-cells get very low or you begin to get certain illnesses that people with healthy immune systems don\u2019t get, HIV has progressed to AIDS.\nAIDS can cause rapid weight loss, extreme tiredness, mouth or genital ulcers, fevers, night sweats and skin discolorations. Other illnesses and cancers often happen in people living with AIDS and can cause additional symptoms.\nA retrovirus is a virus that works backward from the way human cells do. Human cells have instructions (DNA) that send a message (RNA) to make building blocks for your body (proteins).\nRetroviruses have their instructions written on RNA. When a retrovirus invades your cells, it changes its RNA to look like your cells\u2019 instructions (DNA). Then it cuts your cells\u2019 DNA and inserts its instructions into them. Your cell then acts as though the virus\u2019 instructions are its own.\nHIV is a retrovirus. All viruses invade your cells and then use your cells\u2019 \u201cmachinery\u201d to make more copies of themselves. HIV not only uses your cells to make more of itself, but it also inserts its instructions into your DNA.\nIt\u2019s a myth that HIV only infects certain people. Anyone can get HIV if they\u2019re exposed to the virus. Having sex without a condom or sharing needles to inject drugs are the most common ways that HIV spreads.\nSome populations are statistically more affected by HIV than others. Groups disproportionately affected by HIV include:\nWhile these aren\u2019t the only populations impacted by HIV, it\u2019s important to consider that they face unique barriers to accessing preventative care, getting tested, and receiving comprehensive treatment. Social stigmas around HIV continue to drive barriers and keep people from accessing high-quality healthcare.\nThe number of new HIV infections has declined. In 2019, 1.2 million people in the US were living with HIV. About 13% of those don\u2019t know they have it, which is why routine testing for HIV is important.\nYou can have HIV without having any symptoms. This is why it\u2019s important to get tested even if you don\u2019t feel sick.\nSometimes you\u2019ll have flu-like symptoms when you first get infected with HIV. These can include:\nHIV has three stages:\nSome people get flu-like symptoms a month or two after they\u2019ve been infected with HIV. These symptoms often go away within a week to a month.\nAfter the acute stage, you can have HIV for many years without feeling sick. It's important to know that you can still spread HIV to others even if you feel well.\nAIDS is the most serious stage of HIV infection. In this stage, HIV has severely weakened your immune system and opportunistic infections are much more likely to make you sick.\nOpportunistic infections are ones that someone with a healthy immune system could typically fight off. When HIV has advanced to AIDS, these illnesses take advantage of your weakened immune system.\nYou\u2019re more likely to get certain cancers when you have AIDS. These cancers and opportunistic infections together are called AIDS-defining illnesses.\nTo be diagnosed with AIDS, you must be infected with HIV and have at least one of the following:\nAIDS-defining illnesses are opportunistic infections, certain cancers (usually caused by viruses) and some neurological conditions. They include:\nSymptoms of AIDS can be caused by HIV infection, but many are from illnesses that take advantage of your weakened immune system.\nHIV is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus. The virus attacks the helper T-cells of your immune system, leaving it weakened.\nAIDS is caused by having too few immune cells to fight off other illnesses.\nYou can get HIV through the blood, semen, vaginal fluids, breast milk and rectal fluids of an infected person. People of all sexes and sexual orientations can get infected with and spread HIV.\nThe virus can enter your body through your mouth, anus, penis, vagin\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

However, understanding what role, if any, unintegrated viral DNA plays in the natural history of HIV-1 has remained elusive. Unintegrated HIV-1 DNA is reported to possess a limited capacity for gene expression restricted to early gene products and is considered a replicative dead end. Although the majority of peripheral blood CD4+ T cells are refractory to infection, nonactivated CD4 T cells present in lymphoid and mucosal tissues are major targets for infection. Treatment with cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-7, or IL-15 renders CD4+ T cells permissive to HIV-1 infection in the absence of cell activation and proliferation and provides a useful model for infection of resting CD4+ T cells. We found that infection of cytokine-treated resting CD4+ T cells in the presence of raltegravir or with integrase active-site mutant HIV-1 yielded de novo virus production following subsequent T cell activation. Infection with integration-competent HIV-1 naturally generated a population of cells generating virus from unintegrated DNA. Latent infection persisted for several weeks and could be activated to virus production by a combination of a histone deacetylase inhibitor and a protein kinase C activator or by T cell activation. HIV-1 Vpr was essential for unintegrated HIV-1 gene expression and de novo virus production in this system. Bypassing integration by this mechanism may allow the preservation of genetic information that otherwise would be lost. INTRODUCTION As for all retroviruses, integration of the newly reverse transcribed human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) cDNA genome into the host cell's DNA has been observed to be an essential replicative step, with the integrated provirus being the exclusive template for all de novo virus production (1, 2). Integration is mediated by the viral integrase enzyme, which is a product of the pol gene and the target of the recently developed and highly successful integrase inhibitor class of antiretrovirals (3). Since the integrated provirus will remain for the life of the infected cell and its descendants, integration is a major factor in HIV-1 persistence (4, 5). Interestingly, irrespective of the activation status of the infected CD4+ T cell, \u226590% of HIV-1 reverse transcripts fail to integrate in vivo and in vitro (6\u201310). In vivo, this inefficiency of integration results in an accumulation of unintegrated HIV-1 DNA (uDNA) in blood CD4+ T cells and monocytes (7, 8, 11, 12), as well as in lymphoid tissue (8\u201310), brain (13, 14), and untreated patients with high or low viral loads (15, 16). During untreated chronic infection, the majority of infected cells have been reported to contain only unintegrated HIV-1 DNA (7). However, it remains unclear whether unintegrated DNA plays any functional role in the natural history of HIV-1 (17, 18). If the linear cDNA product of reverse transcription fails to integrate, it can be degraded or become circularized. Linear unintegrated HIV-1 DNA, one-long-terminal-repeat (1-LTR) circles, and 2-LTR circles are all capable of limited transcription (17, 19\u201321), which can enhance T cell activation (22). Intriguingly, it has been reported that similar numbers of integrated and unintegrated HIV-1 templates transcribe RNA (23). It is generally observed that uDNA gene expression is higher in nonproliferating cells than in proliferating cells, perhaps owing to a lack of dilution of uDNA templates and their RNA and protein products (17, 24\u201327). The virion-associated Vpr protein transactivates uDNA, enhancing expression of early viral proteins in infected activated CD4+ T cells (28, 29). Vpr has several other activities (30\u201333), including the ability to arrest cell proliferation (34) in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (35, 36), which is favorable to HIV-1 transcription (37, 38), as well as the capacity to enhance HIV-1 replication in nonproliferating cells (33, 39, 40), at least in part through assisting with viral nuclear import (30, 41, 42). Primate immunodeficiency viruses replicate most efficiently in activated CD4+ T cells, which generate the majority of virions in vivo (43, 44). Resting CD4+ T cells derived from peripheral blood are refractory to productive infection (7, 45\u201348) but can be rendered permissive to productive infection by common gamma-chain cytokines, including interlukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-7, and IL-15, without inducing activation or activation-induced proliferation (49\u201351). During early HIV-1 infection in humans and acute simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of rhesus macaques, many viral RNA-positive cells lack activation and proliferation markers and thus resemble resting CD4+ T cells (52\u201358). Infected nonactivated, nonproliferating CD4+ T cells have been identified in high numbers near the sites of mucosal transmission (53, 57) and in lymphoid tissues (59) and are observed after ex vivo infection of lymphoid histocultures (55, 60\u201363). These findings indicate that local environmental factors, such as common gamma-chain cytokines, contribute\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

However, understanding what role, if any, unintegrated viral DNA plays in the natural history of HIV-1 has remained elusive. Unintegrated HIV-1 DNA is reported to possess a limited capacity for gene expression restricted to early gene products and is considered a replicative dead end. Although the majority of peripheral blood CD4+ T cells are refractory to infection, nonactivated CD4 T cells present in lymphoid and mucosal tissues are major targets for infection. Treatment with cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-7, or IL-15 renders CD4+ T cells permissive to HIV-1 infection in the absence of cell activation and proliferation and provides a useful model for infection of resting CD4+ T cells. We found that infection of cytokine-treated resting CD4+ T cells in the presence of raltegravir or with integrase active-site mutant HIV-1 yielded de novo virus production following subsequent T cell activation. Infection with integration-competent HIV-1 naturally generated a population of cells generating virus from unintegrated DNA. Latent infection persisted for several weeks and could be activated to virus production by a combination of a histone deacetylase inhibitor and a protein kinase C activator or by T cell activation. HIV-1 Vpr was essential for unintegrated HIV-1 gene expression and de novo virus production in this system. Bypassing integration by this mechanism may allow the preservation of genetic information that otherwise would be lost. INTRODUCTION As for all retroviruses, integration of the newly reverse transcribed human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) cDNA genome into the host cell's DNA has been observed to be an essential replicative step, with the integrated provirus being the exclusive template for all de novo virus production (1, 2). Integration is mediated by the viral integrase enzyme, which is a product of the pol gene and the target of the recently developed and highly successful integrase inhibitor class of antiretrovirals (3). Since the integrated provirus will remain for the life of the infected cell and its descendants, integration is a major factor in HIV-1 persistence (4, 5). Interestingly, irrespective of the activation status of the infected CD4+ T cell, \u226590% of HIV-1 reverse transcripts fail to integrate in vivo and in vitro (6\u201310). In vivo, this inefficiency of integration results in an accumulation of unintegrated HIV-1 DNA (uDNA) in blood CD4+ T cells and monocytes (7, 8, 11, 12), as well as in lymphoid tissue (8\u201310), brain (13, 14), and untreated patients with high or low viral loads (15, 16). During untreated chronic infection, the majority of infected cells have been reported to contain only unintegrated HIV-1 DNA (7). However, it remains unclear whether unintegrated DNA plays any functional role in the natural history of HIV-1 (17, 18). If the linear cDNA product of reverse transcription fails to integrate, it can be degraded or become circularized. Linear unintegrated HIV-1 DNA, one-long-terminal-repeat (1-LTR) circles, and 2-LTR circles are all capable of limited transcription (17, 19\u201321), which can enhance T cell activation (22). Intriguingly, it has been reported that similar numbers of integrated and unintegrated HIV-1 templates transcribe RNA (23). It is generally observed that uDNA gene expression is higher in nonproliferating cells than in proliferating cells, perhaps owing to a lack of dilution of uDNA templates and their RNA and protein products (17, 24\u201327). The virion-associated Vpr protein transactivates uDNA, enhancing expression of early viral proteins in infected activated CD4+ T cells (28, 29). Vpr has several other activities (30\u201333), including the ability to arrest cell proliferation (34) in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (35, 36), which is favorable to HIV-1 transcription (37, 38), as well as the capacity to enhance HIV-1 replication in nonproliferating cells (33, 39, 40), at least in part through assisting with viral nuclear import (30, 41, 42). Primate immunodeficiency viruses replicate most efficiently in activated CD4+ T cells, which generate the majority of virions in vivo (43, 44). Resting CD4+ T cells derived from peripheral blood are refractory to productive infection (7, 45\u201348) but can be rendered permissive to productive infection by common gamma-chain cytokines, including interlukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-7, and IL-15, without inducing activation or activation-induced proliferation (49\u201351). During early HIV-1 infection in humans and acute simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of rhesus macaques, many viral RNA-positive cells lack activation and proliferation markers and thus resemble resting CD4+ T cells (52\u201358). Infected nonactivated, nonproliferating CD4+ T cells have been identified in high numbers near the sites of mucosal transmission (53, 57) and in lymphoid tissues (59) and are observed after ex vivo infection of lymphoid histocultures (55, 60\u201363). These findings indicate that local environmental factors, such as common gamma-chain cytokines, contribute\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Diagnosis and staging were based on the 2014 US surveillance case definition for HIV infection. We divided early HIV-1 infection (stage 0) into two subcategories. Subcategory 0\u03b1: a negative or indeterminate HIV-1 antibody test was \u226460 days after the first confirmed positive HIV-1 test or a negative or indeterminate antibody test or qualitative HIV-1 nucleic acid test (NAT) was \u2264180 days before the first positive test, the latter being a NAT or detectable viral load. Subcategory 0\u03b2: a negative or indeterminate antibody or qualitative NAT was \u2264180 days before the first positive test, the latter being an HIV antibody or antigen/antibody test. We compared median earliest viral loads for each stage and subcategory in each of the first 6 weeks after diagnosis using only the earliest viral load for each individual.\nResults: Of 203,392 infections, 56.69% (115,297/203,392) were reported with a quantified earliest viral load within 6 weeks after diagnosis and criteria sufficient to determine the stage at diagnosis. Among 5081 infections at stage 0, the median earliest viral load fell from 694,000 copies/mL in week 1 to 125,022 in week 2 and 43,473 by week 6. Among 30,910 infections in stage 1, the median earliest viral load ranged 15,412-17,495. Among 42,784 infections in stage 2, the median viral load declined from 44,973 in week 1 to 38,497 in week 6. Among 36,522 infections in stage 3 (AIDS), the median viral load dropped from 205,862 in week 1 to 119,000 in week 6. The median earliest viral load in stage 0 subcategory 0\u03b1 fell from 1,344,590 copies/mL in week 1 to 362,467 in week 2 and 47,320 in week 6, while that in subcategory 0\u03b2 was 70,114 copies/mL in week 1 and then 32,033 to 44,067 in weeks 2-6.

However, the obligation for lifelong adherence, increased risk of accumulated co-morbidities, and continued lack of uniform availability around the globe underscores the need for an HIV cure. Safe and scalable HIV cure strategies remain elusive, in large part due to the presence of viral reservoirs in which caches of infected cells remain hidden from immune elimination, primarily within tissues. Herein, we summarize some of the most exciting recent advances focused on understanding, quantifying, and ultimately targeting HIV tissue viral reservoirs.\nCurrent studies have underscored the differences between viral reservoirs in tissue compartments as compared to peripheral blood, in particular the gastrointestinal tract. Additionally, several novel or modified techniques are showing promise in targeting the latent viral reservoir, including modifications in drug delivery platforms and techniques such as CRISPR.\nElimination of tissue viral reservoirs are likely the key to generation of an effective HIV cure. Exciting studies have come out recently that reveal crucial insights into topics ranging from the basic biology of reservoir seeding to effective drug targeting. However, there are still many outstanding questions in the field about the relative importance of specific reservoirs, such as the gastrointestinal tract, that may alter the final strategy pursued.\nKeywords: HIV, SIV, Reservoir, Lymph Node, Lymphoid tissue, Gastrointestinal Tract\nIn-depth characterization of cellular and anatomic reservoirs for HIV-1, the tissue compartments in which they reside, salient phenotypic characteristics of viral reservoirs, and environmental signals within defined neighborhoods that are critical for persistence remain poorly understood, yet are likely crucial for understanding how to effectively target and eliminate tissue viral reservoirs. Earlier studies of ART in both HIV-1 infected individuals and SIV infected nonhuman primates (NHPs) demonstrated that viral reservoirs are established rapidly and systemically [1]. While reduced by ART, these reservoirs constitute a substantial total body burden of potentially infectious virus [2] resulting in plasma viral loads (pVLs) that, while previously undetectable on ART, rapidly rise upon treatment interruption in all but the rarest circumstances. Since natural, ART-free viral remission is highly infrequent and complete viral eradication via hematopoietic stem cell transplant is neither safe nor feasible at scale, the field has been working towards targeting tissue viral reservoirs that remain a stubborn barrier to an HIV cure.\nLymphoid tissues (LT) are a major source of HIV-infected cells at all stages of infection. Our group and others have shown that LT, including the gut, lymph nodes, and spleen, contain \u226598% of \u2018active\u2019 (vRNA+) and total (vDNA+) SIV reservoirs before and during ART [2]. Even after ART, HIV-1 and SIV persist in these LT compartments for a variety of reasons (Figure 1), including: i) Tissue resident T follicular helper (TFH) cells, which are a preferred cellular reservoir for HIV, and follicular dendritic cells (FDC; a non-infected cellular repository of infectious virions) are long-lived viral reservoirs that reside within B cell follicles (BCF) found in secondary LTs [3, 4**]; ii) residual levels of immune activation and inflammatory mediators are heightened in many LTs (in particular the GALT) during ART [5]; iii) antiretroviral (ARV) drug penetration (particularly protease inhibitors) into tissue sites of viral persistence is very heterogeneous with limited combined exposure to all infected cells, potentially allowing for environments where low level, intermittent viral replication can occur [6, 7*]; and iv) BCFs represent relative immune sanctuaries that are not highly accessible to HIV-1/SIV-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (CTLs), thereby allowing viral reservoirs that reside in these microenvironments to escape CTL elimination [8]. While of interest to the field, non-LT viral reservoirs fall outside the scope of this review, primarily because the mechanisms controlling reservoir establishment, persistence, and clearance have aspects which are unique to each tissue site. A prime example is the brain and CNS, in which recent publications have elucidated how HIV-infected microglia and astrocytes are maintained as well as therapeutic strategies specifically designed to cross the blood-brain barrier, a distinct prerequisite for targeting the CNS reservoir (for a review, see [9]). Given the number of recent and exciting publications, separate reviews are required to do justice to these often rapidly developing fields.\nViral Persistence in Lymphoid Tissues. HIV and SIV can persist in LTs throughout the body even after ART due to: 1) persistence of viral reservoirs in BCFs (both TFH cells and FDCs); 2) residual levels of immune activation and inflammation; 3) incomplete ARV penetration into tissue sites potentially leading to low and intermittent levels of viral replication; and 4) limited accessibility of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells into BCFs. Created with BioRender.com\nIn both HIV-1 and SIV infection, seeding of viral reservoirs occurs early and systemically, especially within LT where the majority of CD4+ T cells reside. This is supported by studies in rhesus macaques showing that long-lived reservoirs harboring replication-competent virus are established as early as 3 days after infection [1] and that integrated HIV-1 DNA in acutely infected individuals can be detected in gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and LNs as early as Fiebig stage I and reach maximal frequencies by Fiebig stage II [10*]. Moreover, at later stages of infection, the frequency of viral DNA is actually higher in LNs than periphe\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Some of them, such as APOBEC3, tetherin, and SERINC5, are well established. Their importance is evident from the fact that HIV-1 uses its accessory proteins Vif, Vpu, and Nef to counteract them. However, the list of antiviral factors is constantly increasing, and accumulating evidence suggests that innate defense mechanisms, which restrict HIV-1 and/or are counteracted by viral proteins, remain to be discovered. These antiviral factors are relevant to diseases other than HIV/AIDS, since they are commonly active against various viral pathogens. In this review, we provide an overview of recently reported antiretroviral factors and viral countermeasures, present the evidence suggesting that more innate defense mechanisms remain to be discovered, and discuss why this is a challenging but rewarding task.\nWhen HIV-1 was discovered \u223c40 years ago (Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi et al., 1983; Levy et al., 1984), it was commonly assumed that the ability of viruses to spread within specific cell types was largely determined by the expression of cell surface receptors required for viral entry. Thanks to the extensive research on HIV-1 and related primate lentiviruses, it has become clear that the intricate interplay between viruses and their host cells is much more complex than initially anticipated. While viruses exploit numerous cellular factors to propagate and spread, cells are not defenseless and have evolved numerous innate immune defense factors that can inhibit viral pathogens at every step of their replication cycle.\nAlmost 20 years after the discovery of HIV-1 as the causative agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), researchers identified the first key restriction factor against this virus. In 2002, the Malim group reported that apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G) causes extensive G-to-A mutations in viral DNA during reverse transcription, rendering HIV-1 noninfectious (Sheehy et al., 2002). Two years later, the Sodroski group discovered that tripartite motif-containing protein 5 alpha (TRIM5\u03b1) targets retroviral capsids and interferes with the early stages of HIV-1 infection in a species-dependent manner (Stremlau et al., 2004). In 2008, the Bieniasz group and the Guatelli group independently reported that tetherin, also known as bone marrow stromal antigen 2, inhibits the release of newly formed HIV-1 particles by physically tethering them to the cell surface (Neil et al., 2008; Van Damme et al., 2008). Three years later, the Benkirane and Skowronski laboratories showed that SAM domain and HD domain-containing protein 1 suppresses HIV-1 replication in some cell types by reducing the pool of available deoxynucleoside triphosphates required for reverse transcription (Hrecka et al., 2011; Laguette et al., 2011). In 2015, the G\u00f6ttlinger group and the Pizzato group independently showed that the incorporation of serine incorporator 5 (SERINC5) into HIV-1 virions impairs their ability to fuse with their target cells (Rosa et al., 2015; Usami et al., 2015).\nThese studies illustrate enormous structural, functional, and evolutionary diversity of restriction factors, which makes it impossible to establish universal defining criteria. While exceptions exist, common characteristics include inducibility by interferons (IFNs) or virus infection and interaction with viral components. In addition, restriction factors are among the most variable cellular proteins. Their amino acid changes are driven by positive selection pressure, prompting adaptations to counter emerging pathogens or evade viral countermeasures. This dynamic reflects the continuous evolutionary arms racing between viruses and their hosts (Kirchhoff, 2010; Duggal and Emerman, 2012; Harris et al., 2012; Malim and Bieniasz, 2012). Many antiviral genes, including APOBEC3 and TRIM5\u03b1, have not only diversified but also multiplied during mammalian evolution and now form families with distinct functions in innate immunity and beyond (Refsland and Harris, 2013; Salter et al., 2016; M\u00fcller and Sauter, 2023). Thus, antiviral factors synergize and may act in a redundant manner to reduce the risk of viral resistance. They are often expressed in specific cell types and usually exhibit broad activity against various viral pathogens and families (Kluge et al., 2015; Colomer-Lluch et al., 2018).\nViruses have evolved complex countermeasures to avoid effective innate control or elimination. The HIV-1 genome encodes four accessory proteins: viral infectivity factor (Vif), viral protein R (Vpr), viral protein U (Vpu), and negative factor (Nef). These proteins are often not essential for viral replication in cell lines but are critical for viral immune evasion and effective spread in vivo. Efficient counteraction by HIV-1 accessory proteins is perhaps the best-accepted evidence for the importance of an antiviral protein. For example, APOBEC3 proteins are targeted by Vif for degradation, preventing virion incorporation, and hence maintaining its genetic integrity (Sheehy et al., 2002). Several key enzymes in DNA repair pathways (UNG2, HTLF, and Exo1) are targeted for proteasomal degradation by Vpr, which is associated with viral particles (Hrecka et al., 2016; Lahouassa et al., 2016; Yan et al., 2018). Tetherin is counteracted by HIV-1 Vpu and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) Nef through distinct mechanisms that ultimately reduce its expression at the cell surface (Neil et al., 2008; Jia et al., 2009; Sauter et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009). Nef also downregulates SERINC5 expression on the cell surface to prevent virion incorporation (Rosa et al., 2015; Usami et al., 2015). SERINC5 illustrates that exceptions exist to all of the outlined characteristics, since it does not show a response to positive selection pressure and its ex\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

However, as cells of the innate immune system, NK cells are classified as group I Innate Lymphocytes (ILCs) and respond quickly to a wide variety of pathological challenges. NK cells are best known for killing virally infected cells, and detecting and controlling early signs of cancer. As well as protecting against disease, specialized NK cells are also found in the placenta and may play an important role in pregnancy.\nNK cells were first noticed for their ability to kill tumour cells without any priming or prior activation (in contrast to cytotoxic T cells, which need priming by antigen presenting cells). They are named for this \u2018natural\u2019 killing. Additionally, NK cells secrete cytokines such as IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1, which act on other immune cells like Macrophage and Dendritic cells to enhance the immune response.\nWhile on patrol NK cells constantly contact other cells. Whether or not the NK cell kills these cells depends on a balance of signals from activating receptors and inhibitory receptors on the NK cell surface. Activating receptors recognise molecules that are expressed on the surface of cancer cells and infected cells, and \u2018switch on\u2019 the NK cell. Inhibitory receptors act as a check on NK cell killing. Most normal healthy cells express MHC I receptors which mark these cells as \u2018self\u2019. Inhibitory receptors on the surface of the NK cell recognise cognate MHC I, and this \u2018switches off\u2019 the NK cell, preventing it from killing. Cancer cells and infected cells often lose their MHC I, leaving them vulnerable to NK cell killing. Once the decision is made to kill, the NK cell releases cytotoxic granules containing perforin and granzymes, which leads to lysis of the target cell.\nThe genes for both MHC I and the NK cell inhibitory receptors which recognise them vary a lot between individuals. The versions (or alleles) of these genes a person carries have been linked to their ability to fight HIV infection and their risk of some autoimmune diseases. NK cell varieties also change with age and are affected by chronic viral infections such as cytomegalovirus (CMV).\nBecause of their ability to kill tumour cells, NK cells are an attractive target for cancer immunotherapies. Some therapeutic monoclonal antibodies rely on NK cell killing. Researchers are also developing treatments to activate NK cells using small molecules or cytokines, and even testing genetically modified living NK cells as therapies.\n\u00a9 The copyright for this work resides with the author\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Video courtesy of Morgan Huse.\nScientists are coming to appreciate the importance of a specific type of immune cell that keeps people free from disease.\nMost people familiar with the immune system have heard of T cells. These versatile immune cells, which protect us from infections and cancer, have been the focus of immunotherapy \u2014 approaches that use the body\u2019s immune system to fight cancer.\nLesser known, but no less important to healthy immune function, is an immune cell called a natural killer (NK) cell. These specialized fighters destroy damaged or stressed cells, including those infected with viruses and ones showing signs of genetic damage.\nNK cells are experiencing something of a renaissance these days. Scientists are finding they can\u2019t fully understand the body\u2019s response to cancer without taking these cells into account.\nIn 2016, for instance, scientists at the Sloan Kettering Institute discovered that NK cells play a role in metastatic latency. This means that they help keep rogue cancer cells in check and prevent the disease from growing and spreading.\nAnd just last month, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) found that the presence of NK cells in a tumor may help explain why some people respond to certain types of immunotherapy while others do not.\nSo what sets these Quentin Tarantino\u2013esque cells apart from other immune cells?\nAs their name implies, natural killer cells have a special ability to kill their targets without needing to be trained. This contrasts with other immune cells, like T cells, which have to learn how to recognize danger.\nNK cells have two main ways of taking out threats. One is by detecting the presence of stress signals emitted by cells in trouble, including those with genetic damage that might lead to cancer. These stress signals cue NK cells to kill them, in a kind of altruistic self-sacrifice.\n\u201cI tell my students that stressed cells put up \u2018kill me\u2019 flags,\u201d says Joseph Sun, an immunologist in SKI and a professor at the Gerstner Sloan Kettering Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences who studies NK cells.\nThe other way NK cells protect us is by recognizing cells that lack identifiable markers of \u201cself.\u201d Each of our cells has a molecule on it called MHC that differentiates our cells from other people\u2019s cells. NK cells are naturally equipped to kill cells that lack these self-identifying molecules, which in most cases means virally infected cells. Certain viruses have evolved to trick the cells they infect into removing MHC molecules from their surface. This allows the viruses to fly under the radar of T cells, which require MHC for their action.\nLuckily, removing MHC makes the infected cells vulnerable to killing by NK cells.\nCancer cells also sometimes remove their MHC molecules, which means that T cells can\u2019t protect us from these transformed cells, but NK cells can.\nBiology textbooks usually refer to NK cells as part of the innate immune system. This is the system of immune defenses that are present from birth and are always active. Innate immune cells are good at stopping invaders at the gate, but they don\u2019t stick around after a fight, and they don\u2019t learn from past experience.\nThis description doesn\u2019t apply very well to NK cells, it turns out. \u201cNK cells remember, and they can persist in the body for long periods of time,\u201d explains Dr. Sun, whose lab discovered some of these previously unrecognized properties of NK cells. \u201cThis makes them more like the T or B cells of the adaptive immune system.\u201d\nDr. Sun discovered these adaptive qualities of NK cells while he was a postdoctoral fellow in Lewis Lanier\u2019s lab at UCSF. \u201cPeople were very skeptical at first because, for the longest time, the dogma was that NK cells are innate. Anytime you challenge what\u2019s written in a textbook, you\u2019re going to get some backlash from certain folks in the community,\u201d he explains.\nBut over time, he says, more and more evidence in both mice and humans has supported his findings. \u201cI think it\u2019s far more accepted now,\u201d he says.\nIt makes sense: NK cells, T cells, and B cells all develop from the same precursor cell, called a common lymphoid progenitor. They\u2019re basically siblings.\nScientists have begun exploring the use of NK cells in cancer immunotherapy. Some groups have equipped NK cells with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), in the hopes that these cells will prove safer or more effective than CAR T cells, for example.\nAnd NK cells may be playing an unacknowledged role in other types of immunotherapy. Like T cells, NK cells have immune checkpoint molecules, such as CTLA-4 and PD-1. These molecules function like brakes on immune cell activity. They are common targets for the immunotherapy drugs called checkpoint inhibitors. While T cells get most of the credit for the sometimes dramatic responses seen in people receiving these drugs, it could be that NK cells are also contributing to the effect.\n\u201cWhat some T cell biologists probably don\u2019t recognize, or just happily ignore, is that you\u2019re probably unleashing \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

While T cells get most of the credit for the sometimes dramatic responses seen in people receiving these drugs, it could be that NK cells are also contributing to the effect.\n\u201cWhat some T cell biologists probably don\u2019t recognize, or just happily ignore, is that you\u2019re probably unleashing \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",
