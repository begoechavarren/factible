    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nHubris is a Greek word that means dangerously overconfident. Based on my research, hubris fairly describes our current response to the issue of climate change. Here\u2019s what many people believe: One: The planet is warming catastrophically because of certain human behaviors. Two: Thanks to powerful computers we can project what the climate will be like 20, 40, or even 100 years from now. Three: That if we eliminate just one behavior, the burning of fossil fuels, we can prevent the climate from changing for as long we like. Each of these presumptions\u2014together, the basis of our hubris regarding the changing climate\u2014is either untrue or so far off the mark as to be useless. Yes, it\u2019s true that the globe is warming, and that humans are exerting a warming influence upon it. But beyond that, to paraphrase a line from the classic movie The Princess Bride, \u201cI do not think \u2018The Science\u2019 says what you think it says.\u201d For example, government reports state clearly that heat waves in the US are now no more common than they were in 1900. Hurricane activity is no different than it was a century ago. Floods have not increased across the globe over more than seventy years. Greenland\u2019s ice sheet isn\u2019t shrinking any more rapidly today than it was 80 years ago. Why aren\u2019t these reassuring facts better known? Because the public gets its climate information almost exclusively from the media. And from a media perspective, fear sells. \u201cThings aren\u2019t that bad\u201d doesn\u2019t sell. Very few people, and that includes journalists who report on climate news, read the actual science. I have. And what the data\u2014the hard science\u2014from the US government and UN Climate reports say is that\u2026 \u201cthings aren\u2019t that bad.\u201d Nor does the public understand the questionable basis of all catastrophic climate change projections: computer modeling. Projecting future climate is excruciatingly difficult. Yes, there are human influences, but the climate is complex. Anyone who says that climate models are \u201cjust physics\u201d either doesn\u2019t understand them or is being deliberately misleading. I should know: I wrote one of the first textbooks on computer modeling. While modelers base their assumptions upon both fundamental physical laws and observations of the climate, there is still considerable judgment involved. And since different modelers will make different assumptions, results vary widely among different models. Let\u2019s just take one simple, but significant assumption modelers must make: the impact of clouds on the climate. Natural fluctuations in the height and coverage of clouds have at least as much of an impact on the flows of sunlight and heat as do human influences. But how can we possibly know global cloud coverage say 10, let alone 50 years from now? Obviously, we can\u2019t. But to create a climate model, we have to make assumptions. That\u2019s a pretty shaky foundation on which to transform the world\u2019s economy. By the way, creating more accurate models isn\u2019t getting any easier. In fact, the more we learn about the climate system, the more we realize how complex it is. Rather than admit this complexity, the media, the politicians, and a good portion of the climate science community attribute every terrible storm, every flood, every major fire to \u201cclimate change.\u201d Yes, we\u2019ve always had these weather events in the past, the narrative goes, but somehow \u201cclimate change\u201d is making everything \u201cworse.\u201d Even if that were true, isn\u2019t the relevant question, how much worse? Not to mention that \u201cworse\u201d is not exactly a scientific term. And how would we make it better? For the alarmists, that\u2019s easy: we get rid of fossil fuels. Not only is this impractical\u2014we get over 80% of the world\u2019s energy from fossil fuels\u2014it\u2019s not scientifically possible. That\u2019s because CO2 doesn\u2019t disappear from the atmosphere in a few days like, say, smog. It hangs around for a really long time. About 60 percent of any CO2 that we emit today will remain in the atmosphere 20 years from now, between 30 and 55 percent will still be there after a century, and between 15 and 30 percent will remain after one thousand years. In other words, it takes centuries for the excess carbon dioxide to vanish from the atmosphere. So, any partial reductions in CO2 emissions would only slow the increase in human influences\u2014not prevent it, let alone reverse it. CO2 is not a knob that we can just turn down to fix everything. We don\u2019t have that ability. To think that we do is\u2026 hubris. Hubris leads to bad decisions. A little humility and a little knowledge would lead to better ones.

Virtually all climate scientists agree that this increase in heat-trapping gases is the main reason for the 1.8\u00b0F (1.0\u00b0C) rise in global average temperature since the late nineteenth century. Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, and various chlorofluorocarbons are all human-emitted heat-trapping gases. Among these, carbon dioxide is of greatest concern to scientists because it exerts a larger overall warming influence than the other gases combined.\nSteam billows from the Intermountain Power Plant in Delta, Utah.

Of this human-produced carbon, forests and other vegetation absorb around 3.2 billion metric tons per year, while the ocean absorbs about 2.5 billion metric tons per year. A net 5 billion metric tons of human-produced carbon remain in the atmosphere each year, raising the global average carbon dioxide concentrations by about 2.3 parts per million per year.

Over the last century, burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nHuman activities are driving the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century.\nScientists attribute the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century to the human expansion of the \"greenhouse effect\"1 \u2014 warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth toward space.\nLife on Earth depends on energy coming from the Sun. About half the light energy reaching Earth's atmosphere passes through the air and clouds to the surface, where it is absorbed and radiated in the form of infrared heat. About 90% of this heat is then absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-radiated, slowing heat loss to space.\nA vital component of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide (CO2) is released through natural processes (like volcanic eruptions) and through human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation.\nLike many atmospheric gases, methane comes from both natural and human-caused sources. Methane comes from plant-matter breakdown in wetlands and is also released from landfills and rice farming. Livestock animals emit methane from their digestion and manure. Leaks from fossil fuel production and transportation are another major source of methane, and natural gas is 70% to 90% methane.\nA potent greenhouse gas produced by farming practices, nitrous oxide is released during commercial and organic fertilizer production and use. Nitrous oxide also comes from burning fossil fuels and burning vegetation and has increased by 18% in the last 100 years.\nThese chemical compounds do not exist in nature \u2013 they are entirely of industrial origin. They were used as refrigerants, solvents (a substance that dissolves others), and spray can propellants.\nFORCING: Something acting upon Earth's climate that causes a change in how energy flows through it (such as long-lasting, heat-trapping gases - also known as greenhouse gases). These gases slow outgoing heat in the atmosphere and cause the planet to warm.\nWater vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas, but because the warming ocean increases the amount of it in our atmosphere, it is not a direct cause of climate change. Credit: John Fowler on Unsplash\nFEEDBACKS: A process where something is either amplified or reduced as time goes on, such as water vapor increasing as Earth warms leading to even more warming.\nOver the last century, burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). This increase happens because the coal or oil burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the air to make CO2. To a lesser extent, clearing of land for agriculture, industry, and other human activities has increased concentrations of greenhouse gases.\nThe industrial activities that our modern civilization depends upon have raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels by nearly 50% since 17502. This increase is due to human activities, because scientists can see a distinctive isotopic fingerprint in the atmosphere.\nIn its Sixth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, composed of scientific experts from countries all over the world, concluded that it is unequivocal that the increase of CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere over the industrial era is the result of human activities and that human influence is the principal driver of many changes observed across the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nThe panel's AR6 Working Group I (WGI) Summary for Policymakers report is online at https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/.\nScientists use a metric called Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) to measure the changes in energy the Earth receives from the Sun. TSI incorporates the 11-year solar cycle and solar flares/storms from the Sun's surface.\nStudies show that solar variability has played a role in past climate changes. For example, a decrease in solar activity coupled with increased volcanic activity helped trigger the Little Ice Age.\nBut several lines of evidence show that current global warming cannot be explained by changes in energy from the Sun:\n1.

The problem is, the voracious burning of fossil fuels for energy is artificially amping up the natural greenhouse effect. The result? An increase in global warming that is altering the planet\u2019s climate system. Here\u2019s a look at what the greenhouse effect is, what causes it, and how we can temper its contributions to our changing climate.\nThe greenhouse effect is the natural warming of the earth that results when gases in the atmosphere trap heat from the sun that would otherwise escape into space. The process was identified by scientists in the 1800s.\nSunlight, with the natural greenhouse effect process, makes the earth habitable. While around 30 percent of the solar energy\u2014the light and heat from the sun\u2014that reaches our world is reflected back into space, the rest is either absorbed by the atmosphere or the earth\u2019s surface. This process, which is constantly happening around the globe, warms the planet. This heat is then radiated back up in the form of invisible infrared radiation. While some of this infrared light continues on into space, the vast majority gets absorbed by atmospheric gases, known as greenhouse gases, causing further warming.\nBut higher concentrations of greenhouse gases, and carbon dioxide (CO2) in particular, are causing extra heat to be trapped and average global temperatures to rise. For most of the past 800,000 years\u2014much longer than human civilization has existed\u2014the concentration of CO2 in our atmosphere was roughly between 200 and 280 parts per million. (In other words, there were 200 to 280 molecules of the gases per million molecules of air.) But in the past century, that concentration has jumped. In 2013, driven up largely by the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, CO2 in the earth\u2019s atmosphere surpassed 400 parts per million\u2014a concentration not seen on the planet for millions of years. As of 2023, it has reached more than 420 parts per million, which is 50 percent higher than preindustrial levels.\nMichal Bednarski for NRDC\nEarth\u2019s greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere and warm the planet. The main gases responsible for the greenhouse effect include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and water vapor. In addition to these natural compounds, synthetic fluorinated gases also function as greenhouse gases. Different greenhouse gases have different chemical properties and are removed from the atmosphere, over time, by various processes. Carbon dioxide, for example, is absorbed by \u201ccarbon sinks\u201d such as forests, soil, and the ocean. Fluorinated gases are only destroyed by sunlight in the far upper atmosphere.\nHow much any one greenhouse gas influences global warming depends on three key factors:\nRadiative forcing (RF) is another way to measure greenhouse gases (and other climate drivers, such as the sun\u2019s brightness and large volcanic eruptions). Also known as climate forcing, RF indicates the difference between how much of the sun\u2019s energy gets absorbed by the earth and how much is released into space as a result of any one climate driver. A climate driver with a positive RF value indicates that it has a warming effect on the planet; a negative value represents cooling.\nThe release of greenhouse gases associated with human activities and climate change is referred to as greenhouse gas emissions, or climate pollution. And since the start of the Industrial Revolution and the advent of coal-powered steam engines, human activities have supersized the volume of greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere. It is estimated that between 1750 and 2019, atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide increased by 47 percent, methane by 156 percent, and nitrous oxide by 23 percent. In the late 1920s, we started adding man-made fluorinated gases like chlorofluorocarbons to the mix.\nIn recent decades, we\u2019ve only picked up the pace. Of all the human-driven emissions of carbon dioxide, approximately half were generated in the last 30 years alone. And while global greenhouse gas emissions have occasionally plateaued or dropped from year to year (most recently at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, as the pause in global travel and manufacturing dropped carbon dioxide emissions almost 6 percent), they\u2019re accelerating once again.\nThe most significant gases that cause global warming via the greenhouse effect are the following:\nCarbon dioxide Accounting for almost 80 percent of global human-caused emissions, carbon dioxide sticks around for quite a while. Once it\u2019s emitted into the atmosphere, 40 percent still remains after 100 years, 20 percent after 1,000 years, and 10 percent as long as 10,000 years later. (Carbon dioxide\u2019s lifetime cannot be represented with a single value because the gas is not destroyed over time, but instead moves among different parts of the ocean, atmosphere, and land. Some carbon dioxide is absorbed quickly, but some will remain in the atmosphere for thousands of years.)\nMethane Methane (CH4) persists in the atmosphere for around 12 years, which is less time than carbon dioxide, but it is much more potent in terms of the greenhouse effect. In fact, pound for pound, its global warming impact is almost 30 times greater than that of carbon dioxide over a 100-year period. In the United States, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), methane accounted for more than 12 percent of human-generated greenhouse gas emissions in 2021. While methane can come from natural sources like wetlands, more than half of all global methane emiss\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

About half the light energy reaching Earth's atmosphere passes through the air and clouds to the surface, where it is absorbed and radiated in the form of infrared heat. About 90% of this heat is then absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-radiated, slowing heat loss to space.\nA vital component of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide (CO2) is released through natural processes (like volcanic eruptions) and through human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation.\nLike many atmospheric gases, methane comes from both natural and human-caused sources. Methane comes from plant-matter breakdown in wetlands and is also released from landfills and rice farming. Livestock animals emit methane from their digestion and manure. Leaks from fossil fuel production and transportation are another major source of methane, and natural gas is 70% to 90% methane.\nA potent greenhouse gas produced by farming practices, nitrous oxide is released during commercial and organic fertilizer production and use. Nitrous oxide also comes from burning fossil fuels and burning vegetation and has increased by 18% in the last 100 years.\nThese chemical compounds do not exist in nature \u2013 they are entirely of industrial origin. They were used as refrigerants, solvents (a substance that dissolves others), and spray can propellants.\nFORCING: Something acting upon Earth's climate that causes a change in how energy flows through it (such as long-lasting, heat-trapping gases - also known as greenhouse gases). These gases slow outgoing heat in the atmosphere and cause the planet to warm.\nWater vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas, but because the warming ocean increases the amount of it in our atmosphere, it is not a direct cause of climate change. Credit: John Fowler on Unsplash\nFEEDBACKS: A process where something is either amplified or reduced as time goes on, such as water vapor increasing as Earth warms leading to even more warming.\nOver the last century, burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). This increase happens because the coal or oil burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the air to make CO2. To a lesser extent, clearing of land for agriculture, industry, and other human activities has increased concentrations of greenhouse gases.\nThe industrial activities that our modern civilization depends upon have raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels by nearly 50% since 17502. This increase is due to human activities, because scientists can see a distinctive isotopic fingerprint in the atmosphere.\nIn its Sixth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, composed of scientific experts from countries all over the world, concluded that it is unequivocal that the increase of CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere over the industrial era is the result of human activities and that human influence is the principal driver of many changes observed across the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nThe panel's AR6 Working Group I (WGI) Summary for Policymakers report is online at https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/.\nScientists use a metric called Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) to measure the changes in energy the Earth receives from the Sun. TSI incorporates the 11-year solar cycle and solar flares/storms from the Sun's surface.\nStudies show that solar variability has played a role in past climate changes. For example, a decrease in solar activity coupled with increased volcanic activity helped trigger the Little Ice Age.\nBut several lines of evidence show that current global warming cannot be explained by changes in energy from the Sun:\n1.

This paper has three goals. First, it provides background on the climate crisis, the role of human behavior in creating this crisis, and the health impacts of climate change. Second, it proposes a multilevel, translational approach to investigating health behavior change in the context of the climate crisis. Third, it identifies specific challenges and opportunities for increasing the rigor of behavioral medicine research in the context of the climate crisis. The paper closes with a call for behavioral medicine to be responsive to the climate crisis.\nKeywords: Behavioral medicine, Climate change, Global warming, Anthropocene, Mitigation, Adaptation, Health co-benefits\nClimate change is transforming the planet and, consequently, exacerbating threats to human health. This paper offers a framework for remaking behavioral medicine research to address climate change and its impacts.\nPractice: Instilling a sense of connection, promoting empathy, and developing a vision for humankind as interdependent must be a priority if we are to foster the kinds of behaviors\u2014individually and collectively\u2014that will promote planetary health.\nPolicy: Ultimately, the goals of our work as behavioral medicine researchers, practitioners, and policy makers, in response to the crises resulting from climate change, must be to redefine individual health and health behaviors as part of planetary health, with a priority on identifying how to motivate individuals to see themselves as part of humankind and take collective action.\nResearch: Priorities for a behavioral medicine research agenda include (1) promoting behavior changes to facilitate planetary health, (2) identifying and developing behavioral interventions at multiple levels\u2014from the individual to systems-level\u2014to facilitate climate-resilient health behaviors, and (3) preparing ourselves and our patients for future shocks to physical, social, and health systems that will feel uncanny and alien.\nThe climate crisis (and its attendant mass extinctions and ecological breakdown) is the most complex and consequential challenge humans have ever faced [1]. For the past 10,000 years, Earth has experienced an incredibly stable temperature, which yielded predictable seasons, favorable conditions for agriculture and complex social systems, and enough consistency in the frequency and intensity of \u201cnatural\u201d threats to allow for reliable infrastructure development. Because nature was predictable, we were able to develop technologies, cities, economies, and other markers of civilization that allowed many of us to ignore it. That period, because it was so odd in geographical terms, was given a name: the Holocene. We had long assumed that this stability was the only and natural state of Earth\u2019s systems, but we now know that burning fossil fuels for energy has caused many of Earth\u2019s systems to change radically [2\u20135].\nWe now live in the Anthropocene, an era of hotter temperatures and more variable weather conditions (as well as other human-caused changes to natural systems) that threaten human lives and the continuity of human civilizations. The past 7 years were the hottest ever recorded globally, and we are unlikely to enjoy such cool conditions again, because most or all of the years in the next decade will continue to shatter record high temperatures [6]. Indeed, paleoclimatologists have consulted the geologic record for past eras that could serve as analogs for Earth\u2019s near-future state, and found that, by the 2030s, the mid-Pliocene (3.3\u20133 million years ago) was the closest match [7]. The mid-Pliocene era is the most recent period with atmospheric CO2 comparable with the present (ca. 400 ppm), with mean annual surface temperatures approximately 1.8\u00b0C\u20133.6\u00b0C warmer than preindustrial temperatures (i.e., 1,850\u20131,900), reduced ice sheet extents, and increased sea levels. Just as pre-Holocene Earth was inhospitable to human life, we now face accelerating risk of a rapid, irreversible return to a state of extreme instability and unpredictability across many Earth systems simultaneously [8]. Although every living species has an ancestor that survived the mid-Pliocene, past global warming/cooling took place over millennia. No species has faced the unprecedented speed at which anthropogenic warming is occurring [9]. Scientific estimates of the year in which mean local climate conditions will fall outside of the range to which its human infrastructure and plants/animals have adapted (e.g., mean annual temperature exceed the highest previously observed temperature for the area, and do not return) fall between 2036 (for tropical regions with very low prior variance) and 2080 (for more variable areas, under optimistic emissions scenarios), with a global (optimistic emissions) date of 2069 [4].\nThe popular term for the thresholds in Earth\u2019s dynamic climate and ecological systems, past which rapid, consequential changes would make them inhospitable to humans, is \u201ctipping points\u201d [10]. These tipping points are terrifying, because they signify shifts from the current, steadily worsening conditions according to well understood causal associations between human activity and environmental consequence, to nonlinear (runaway, cascading) changes of unknown speed and upper bound. Such changes could be locked in, and represent a transformative shift from a state in which human activity functions as a crucial protector of human civilization to one in which such activity instead contributes to destabilizing the planetary conditions on which we depend.\nThe first and most pressing example of human contributors to destabilizing the Earth systems that sustain our civilizations is global heating. Currently, the defining feature of modern civilizations is that they require massive energy use to maintain the unprecedented productivity and annual growt\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

During ice ages, CO2 levels were around 200 parts per million (ppm), and during the warmer interglacial periods, they hovered around 280 ppm (see fluctuations in the graph). In 2013, CO2 levels surpassed 400 ppm for the first time in recorded history. This recent relentless rise in CO2 shows a remarkably constant relationship with fossil-fuel burning, and can be well accounted for based on the simple premise that about 60 percent of fossil-fuel emissions stay in the air.\nToday, we stand on the threshold of a new geologic era, which some term the \"Anthropocene\", one where the climate is very different to the one our ancestors knew.\nIf fossil-fuel burning continues at a business-as-usual rate, such that humanity exhausts the reserves over the next few centuries, CO2 will continue to rise to levels of order of 1500 ppm.

Human behaviour is crucial in climate change mitigation, and in tackling the arising consequences. In this joint Focus issue between Nature Climate Change and Nature Human Behaviour, we take a closer look at the role of human behaviour in the climate crisis.\nIn the late 19th century, the scientist (and suffragette) Eunice Newton Foote published a paper suggesting that a build-up of carbon dioxide in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere could cause increased surface temperatures1. In the mid-20th century, the British engineer Guy Callendar was the first to concretize the link between carbon dioxide levels and global warming2. Now, a century and a half after Foote\u2019s work, there is overwhelming scientific evidence that human behaviour is the main driver of climatic changes and global warming.\nThe negative effects of rising temperatures on the environment, biodiversity and human health are becoming increasingly noticeable. The years 2020 and 2016 were among the hottest since the record keeping of annual surface temperatures began in 1880 (ref. 3). Throughout 2022, the globe was plagued by record-breaking heatwaves. Even regions with a naturally warm climate, such as Pakistan or India, experienced some of their hottest days much earlier in the year \u2014 very probably a consequence of climate change4. According to the National Centers for Environmental Information of the United States, the surface global temperature during the decade leading up to 2020 was +0.82 \u00b0C (+1.48 \u00b0F) above the 20th-century average5. It is clear that we are facing a global crisis that requires urgent action.\nDuring the Climate Change Conference (COP21) of the United Nations in Paris 2015, 196 parties adopted a legally binding treaty with the aim to limit global warming to ideally 1.5 \u00b0C and a maximum of 2 \u00b0C, compared to pre-industrial levels. A recent report issued by the UN suggests that we are very unlikely to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement. Instead, current policies are likely to cause temperatures to increase up to 2.8 \u00b0C this century6. The report suggests that to get on track to 2 \u00b0C, new pledges would need to be four times higher \u2014 and seven times higher to get on track to 1.5 \u00b0C. This November, world leaders will meet for the 27th time to coordinate efforts in facing the climate crisis and mitigating the effects during COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt.\nHuman behaviour is not only one of the primary drivers of climate change but also is equally crucial for mitigating the impact of the Anthropocene. In 2022, this was also explicitly acknowledged in the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). For the first time, the IPCC directly discussed behavioural, social and cultural dynamics in climate change mitigation7. This joint Focus highlights some of the aspects of the human factor that are central in the adaptation to and prevention of a warming climate, and the mitigation of negative consequences. It features original pieces, and also includes a curated collection of already published content from across journals in the Nature Portfolio.\nIn the light of the empirical evidence for the role of human behaviour in climatic changes, it is curious that the \u2018human factor\u2019 has not always received much attention in key research areas, such as climate modelling. For a long time, climate models to predict global warming and emissions did not account for it. This oversight meant that predictions made by these models have differed greatly in their projected rise in temperatures8,9.\nHuman behaviour is complex and multidimensional, making it difficult \u2014 but crucial \u2014 to account for it in climate models. In a Review, Brian Beckage and colleagues thus look at existing social climate models and make recommendations for how these models can better embed human behaviour in their forecasting.\nThe complexity of humans is also reflected in their psychology. Despite an overwhelming scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change, research suggests that many people underestimate the effects of it, are sceptical of it or deny its existence altogether. In a Review, Matthew Hornsey and Stephan Lewandowsky look at the psychological origins of such beliefs, as well as the roles of think tanks and political affiliation.\nPsychologists are not only concerned with understanding and addressing climate scepticism but are also increasingly worried about mental health consequences. Two narrative Reviews address this topic. Neil Adger et al. discuss the direct and indirect pathways by which climate change affects well-being, and Fiona Charlson et al. adopt a clinical perspective in their piece. They review the literature on the clinical implications of climate change and provide practical suggestions for mental health practitioners.\nTo limit global warming to a minimum, system-level and individual-level behaviour change is necessary. Several pieces in this Focus d\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This recent relentless rise in CO2 shows a remarkably constant ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAncient air bubbles trapped in ice enable us to step back in time and see what Earth's atmosphere, and climate, were like in the distant past. They tell us that levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere are higher than they have been at any time in the past 400,000 years. During ice ages, CO2 levels were around 200 parts per million (ppm), and during the warmer interglacial periods, they hovered around 280 ppm (see fluctuations in the graph). In 2013, CO2 levels surpassed 400 ppm for the first time in recorded history. This recent relentless rise in CO2 shows a remarkably constant relationship with fossil-fuel burning, and can be well accounted for based on the simple premise that about 60 percent of fossil-fuel emissions stay in the air.\nToday, we stand on the threshold of a new geologic era, which some term the \"Anthropocene\", one where the climate is very different to the one our ancestors knew.\nIf fossil-fuel burning continues at a business-as-usual rate, such that humanity exhausts the reserves over the next few centuries, CO2 will continue to rise to levels of order of 1500 ppm. The atmosphere would then not return to pre-industrial levels even tens of thousands of years into the future. This graph not only conveys the scientific measurements, but it also underscores the fact that humans have a great capacity to change the climate and planet.\nYou can also find this graphic on our \u201cEvidence\u201d page.\nDec 1, 2023\nJPEG (427.92 KB)\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Human and Natural Causes - NRDC\n\nGoogle Search Snippet:\nHuman-driven causes of climate change\u200b\u200b Scientists agree that human activity is the primary driver of what we're seeing now worldwide.\n\nFull Page Content:\nHuman activities are driving the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century.\nScientists attribute the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century to the human expansion of the \"greenhouse effect\"1 \u2014 warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth toward space.\nLife on Earth depends on energy coming from the Sun. About half the light energy reaching Earth's atmosphere passes through the air and clouds to the surface, where it is absorbed and radiated in the form of infrared heat. About 90% of this heat is then absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-radiated, slowing heat loss to space.\nA vital component of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide (CO2) is released through natural processes (like volcanic eruptions) and through human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation.\nLike many atmospheric gases, methane comes from both natural and human-caused sources. Methane comes from plant-matter breakdown in wetlands and is also released from landfills and rice farming. Livestock animals emit methane from their digestion and manure. Leaks from fossil fuel production and transportation are another major source of methane, and natural gas is 70% to 90% methane.\nA potent greenhouse gas produced by farming practices, nitrous oxide is released during commercial and organic fertilizer production and use. Nitrous oxide also comes from burning fossil fuels and burning vegetation and has increased by 18% in the last 100 years.\nThese chemical compounds do not exist in nature \u2013 they are entirely of industrial origin. They were used as refrigerants, solvents (a substance that dissolves others), and spray can propellants.\nFORCING: Something acting upon Earth's climate that causes a change in how energy flows through it (such as long-lasting, heat-trapping gases - also known as greenhouse gases). These gases slow outgoing heat in the atmosphere and cause the planet to warm.\nWater vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas, but because the warming ocean increases the amount of it in our atmosphere, it is not a direct cause of climate change. Credit: John Fowler on Unsplash\nFEEDBACKS: A process where something is either amplified or reduced as time goes on, such as water vapor increasing as Earth warms leading to even more warming.\nOver the last century, burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). This increase happens because the coal or oil burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the air to make CO2. To a lesser extent, clearing of land for agriculture, industry, and other human activities has increased concentrations of greenhouse gases.\nThe industrial activities that our modern civilization depends upon have raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels by nearly 50% since 17502. This increase is due to human activities, because scientists can see a distinctive isotopic fingerprint in the atmosphere.\nIn its Sixth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, composed of scientific experts from countries all over the world, concluded that it is unequivocal that the increase of CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere over the industrial era is the result of human activities and that human influence is the principal driver of many changes observed across the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nThe panel's AR6 Working Group I (WGI) Summary for Policymakers report is online at https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/.\nScientists use a metric called Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) to measure the changes in energy the Earth receives from the Sun.

It's been 12 million years since CO2 levels have been as high as 420ppm.\n\nFull Page Content:\nKey Takeaway: The amount of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere has increased sharply in the past 100 years as measured from the ground and from satellites. Since carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, this increase has warmed the planet.\n430ppm\nJune 2025\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) is an important greenhouse gas. Greenhouse gases trap the heat from sunlight, warming the planet. Without any greenhouse gases, Earth would be too cold to support life. But the more greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere, the warmer the planet becomes.\nCarbon dioxide comes from sources such as the burning of fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, and natural gas), wildfires, and volcanic eruptions. The graph shows atmospheric CO2 levels measured by NOAA at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, since 1958. It's important to note that \u201cparts per million\u201d refers to the number of carbon dioxide molecules per million molecules of dry air. The data shown are the latest available, updated monthly.\nThe second animated graph shows CO2 levels from an Antarctic ice core in combination with the observations from Mauna Loa Observatory. This extends the record back through Earth\u2019s last three glacial cycles. The Antarctic ice core measures CO2 levels trapped in tiny air bubbles from the past that were preserved when the ice formed.\nGround-based and satellite measurements have measured a sharp increase in atmospheric CO2 in recent decades. With a more than 50% increase in CO2 since the start of industrial times in the 18th century, scientific measurements have linked this increase primarily to the burning of coal, oil, and gas. This means that CO2 levels are now 150% the value they were at in 1750 \u2014 this is at least 1.5 times greater than the natural increase observed at the end of the last ice age 20,000 years ago, which happened over thousands of years.\nThe animated map below shows the historical changes in global carbon dioxide over time. Note the colors change as the amount of CO2 rises from 365 parts per million (ppm) in 2002 to over 420 ppm in 2022. These measurements from the AIRS instrument come from the mid-troposphere, the layer of Earth's atmosphere that is 8 to 12 kilometers (about 5 to 7 miles) above the ground.\nA closer look at the carbon dioxide measurements at Mauna Loa shows a series of wiggles in the data. Although total CO2 is increasing each year, there is also a short-term cycle visible within the larger trend.\nThis annual rise and fall of CO2 levels is caused by seasonal cycles in photosynthesis on a global scale. In Northern Hemisphere spring, plants come to life and draw in CO2 to fuel their growth. This begins the process of lowering the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. In northern autumn, plant growth stops or slows down, and the whole process reverses itself. Much of the plant matter decomposes, releasing CO2 back to the atmosphere.\nA similar but less intense pattern repeats in the Southern Hemisphere in opposite seasons. Spring growth starts in September and winter decomposition begins in March, so CO2 records in the Southern Hemisphere show the opposite pattern of that seen in Mauna Loa. However, because there is a lot more land and vegetation in the Northern Hemisphere than the southern, the global yearly cycle more closely aligns with the northern seasons.\nSee the cycle in action in the visualization Watching Earth Breathe: The Seasonal Vegetation Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide.\nThis cycle of plant growth gives the graph of CO2 a sawtooth pattern of ups and downs from year to year. At a larger scale, the upward climb of the trend line over the decades is caused by CO2 emissions, primarily from burning fossil fuels. Thus, the data illustrate both natural factors and human additions of CO2.\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Specifically, the evidence shows that certain heat-trapping gases, such as carbon dioxide, are warming the world\u2014and that we release those gases when we burn fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas.\nAs scientific models and methods grow more sophisticated, and as we collect more data, our confidence in human-caused climate change only grows higher. Here\u2019s what we know.\nClimate science encompasses a range of disciplines, from oceanography and meteorology, to chemistry, physics, biology and computer science.\nGenerally speaking, scientists working on climate change compare the climate patterns they observe with patterns developed using sophisticated models of Earth's systems (such as the atmosphere and ocean). By comparing the observed and modeled patterns, scientists can positively identify \"human fingerprints\u201d and attribute a proportion of observed warming to human activities.\nThese fingerprints are found in a diverse range of records from the atmosphere, the ocean, and Earth\u2019s surface. They include rising levels of carbon dioxide, unprecedented warming, and a distinct atomic signature left behind in the atmosphere when fossil fuels are burned.\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) is the heat-trapping gas in our atmosphere responsible for most of the warming measured over the past several decades. It\u2019s released during cement manufacturing and when coal, gas, and oil are burned\u2014something humans started doing a great deal of during the Industrial Revolution through to today.\nThe concentration of CO2 in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere has increased dramatically over the last 150 years, from a pre-industrial era concentration of approximately 280 parts per million (ppm) to more than 410 ppm currently. CO2 concentration levels are unlikely to dip below these annual averages for hundreds of years.\nIn fact, measurements from ancient ice cores show that CO2 is now at its highest levels in over 800,000 years.\nGet the latest updates on our work to fight climate change and how you can help right from your inbox.\nSIGN UP TODAY\nAs the concentration of CO2 and other heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere rises, the Earth warms up. In fact, Earth has recently undergone unprecedented warming, particularly since the 1950s.\nEvery single year since 1977 has been warmer than the 20th century average. Nineteen of the 20 warmest years have occurred since 2001. The period of 2015 to 2019 included the top five hottest years on record.\nAnalysis of these trends strongly suggests that without the emissions from burning coal and oil, it is very unlikely that 13 out of the 15 warmest years on record would have occurred either on their own or in such quick succession. This also makes sense from the known causes.\nIt is extremely likely that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.\nWe know that CO2 warms the world, that CO2 concentrations are at record-breaking levels, and that global temperatures are rising. But how do we know for certain that humans are the cause?\nThe answer is in the science. The CO2 produced from fossil fuels carries a unique signature that differentiates it from CO2 produced from other sources. In brief, it carries a specific ratio of carbon isotopes that is only found in the atmosphere when coal, oil, or gas is burned.\nScientists call this \u03b413C (pronounced \"delta C thirteen\"), and it\u2019s a smoking gun. Since the 1880s, \u03b413C has changed in a way that could only happen if CO2 was increasingly coming from fossil fuel sources.\nThis information tells scientists that human-caused fossil fuel emissions have been the main contributor to the rise in CO2 concentrations since the pre-industrial era.\nWithin the scientific community, there is essentially no disagreement on the causes of climate change. Multiple studies have shown that at least 97 percent of scientists agree that global warming is happening and that human activity is the primary cause.\nMajor scientific assessments also agree. The 2018 US National Climate Assessment\u2014whose authors include 300 leading scientists and thirteen federal government agencies\u2014concludes that \u201cit is extremely likely that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. For the warming over the last century, there is no convincing alternative explanation supported by the extent of the observational evidence.\u201d\nSimilarly, an authoritative 2014 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, written and reviewed by hundreds of climate experts and scientists from countries around the world, states unambiguously: \u201cHuman influence on the climate system is clear, and recent anthropogenic emissions of green-house gases are the highest in history. [\u2026] Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia.\u201d\nWe know that warming and cooling have happened in the past, long before humans were around. Natural \u201cclimate drivers\u201d include the energy from the sun; aerosols from periodic volcanic eruptions, dust, and salt spray; natural ecological phenomena like methane-emitting termite mounds and CO2 uptake by plants; and variations in snow and ice cover that change how much the Earth\u2019s surface reflects the sun\u2019s energy back into space (referred to as albedo).\nAll of these factors have profoundly shaped the Earth\u2019s climate. However, none of them sufficiently explain the recent, dramatic increase in global temperatures. For that, scientists need to include human influences.\nWhen natural and human-induced climate drivers are compared to one another, the human influences are so large that they crowd out other climate drivers over the past half century, producing the warming that we\u2019re all ex\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

It warms the planet to temperatures that keep life on earth, well, livable. Without it, the world would be more like Mars: a frozen, uninhabitable place. The problem is, the voracious burning of fossil fuels for energy is artificially amping up the natural greenhouse effect. The result? An increase in global warming that is altering the planet\u2019s climate system. Here\u2019s a look at what the greenhouse effect is, what causes it, and how we can temper its contributions to our changing climate.\nThe greenhouse effect is the natural warming of the earth that results when gases in the atmosphere trap heat from the sun that would otherwise escape into space. The process was identified by scientists in the 1800s.\nSunlight, with the natural greenhouse effect process, makes the earth habitable. While around 30 percent of the solar energy\u2014the light and heat from the sun\u2014that reaches our world is reflected back into space, the rest is either absorbed by the atmosphere or the earth\u2019s surface. This process, which is constantly happening around the globe, warms the planet. This heat is then radiated back up in the form of invisible infrared radiation. While some of this infrared light continues on into space, the vast majority gets absorbed by atmospheric gases, known as greenhouse gases, causing further warming.\nBut higher concentrations of greenhouse gases, and carbon dioxide (CO2) in particular, are causing extra heat to be trapped and average global temperatures to rise. For most of the past 800,000 years\u2014much longer than human civilization has existed\u2014the concentration of CO2 in our atmosphere was roughly between 200 and 280 parts per million. (In other words, there were 200 to 280 molecules of the gases per million molecules of air.) But in the past century, that concentration has jumped. In 2013, driven up largely by the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, CO2 in the earth\u2019s atmosphere surpassed 400 parts per million\u2014a concentration not seen on the planet for millions of years. As of 2023, it has reached more than 420 parts per million, which is 50 percent higher than preindustrial levels.\nMichal Bednarski for NRDC\nEarth\u2019s greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere and warm the planet. The main gases responsible for the greenhouse effect include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and water vapor. In addition to these natural compounds, synthetic fluorinated gases also function as greenhouse gases. Different greenhouse gases have different chemical properties and are removed from the atmosphere, over time, by various processes. Carbon dioxide, for example, is absorbed by \u201ccarbon sinks\u201d such as forests, soil, and the ocean. Fluorinated gases are only destroyed by sunlight in the far upper atmosphere.\nHow much any one greenhouse gas influences global warming depends on three key factors:\nRadiative forcing (RF) is another way to measure greenhouse gases (and other climate drivers, such as the sun\u2019s brightness and large volcanic eruptions). Also known as climate forcing, RF indicates the difference between how much of the sun\u2019s energy gets absorbed by the earth and how much is released into space as a result of any one climate driver. A climate driver with a positive RF value indicates that it has a warming effect on the planet; a negative value represents cooling.\nThe release of greenhouse gases associated with human activities and climate change is referred to as greenhouse gas emissions, or climate pollution. And since the start of the Industrial Revolution and the advent of coal-powered steam engines, human activities have supersized the volume of greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere. It is estimated that between 1750 and 2019, atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide increased by 47 percent, methane by 156 percent, and nitrous oxide by 23 percent. In the late 1920s, we started adding man-made fluorinated gases like chlorofluorocarbons to the mix.\nIn recent decades, we\u2019ve only picked up the pace. Of all the human-driven emissions of carbon dioxide, approximately half were generated in the last 30 years alone. And while global greenhouse gas emissions have occasionally plateaued or dropped from year to year (most recently at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, as the pause in global travel and manufacturing dropped carbon dioxide emissions almost 6 percent), they\u2019re accelerating once again.\nThe most significant gases that cause global warming via the greenhouse effect are the following:\nCarbon dioxide Accounting for almost 80 percent of global human-caused emissions, carbon dioxide sticks around for quite a while. Once it\u2019s emitted into the atmosphere, 40 percent still remains after 100 years, 20 percent after 1,000 years, and 10 percent as long as 10,000 years later. (Carbon dioxide\u2019s lifetime cannot be represented with a single value because the gas is not destroyed over time, but instead moves among different parts of the ocean, atmosphere, and land. Some carbon dioxide is absorbed quickly, but some will remain in the atmosphere for thousands of years.)\nMethane Methane (CH4) persists in the atmosphere for around 12 years, which is less time than carbon dioxide, but it is much more potent in terms of the greenhouse effect. In fact, pound for pound, its global warming impact is almost 30 times greater than that of carbon dioxide over a 100-year period. In the United States, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), methane accounted for more than 12 percent of human-generated greenhouse gas emissions in 2021. While methane can come from natural sources like wetlands, more than half of all global methane emiss\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Once it's added to the atmosphere, it hangs around, for a long time: between 300 to 1,000 years.\n\nFull Page Content:\n10 MIN READ\nSizing Up Humanity's Impacts on Earth's Changing Atmosphere: A Five-Part Series\nBy Alan Buis, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory\nEarth\u2019s atmosphere is resilient to many of the changes humans have imposed on it. But, says atmospheric scientist David Crisp of NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that our society is.\n\u201cThe resilience of Earth\u2019s atmosphere has been proven throughout our planet\u2019s climate history,\u201d said Crisp, science team lead for NASA\u2019s Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite and its successor instrument, OCO-3, which launched to the International Space Station on May 4. \u201cHumans have increased the abundance of carbon dioxide by 45 percent since the beginning of the Industrial Age. That\u2019s making big changes in our environment, but at the same time, it\u2019s not going to lead to a runaway greenhouse effect or something like that. So, our atmosphere will survive, but, as suggested by UCLA professor and Pulitzer-Prize-winning author Jared Diamond, even the most advanced societies can be more fragile than the atmosphere is.\u201d\nChanges to our atmosphere associated with reactive gases (gases that undergo chemical reactions) like ozone and ozone-forming chemicals like nitrous oxides, are relatively short-lived. Carbon dioxide is a different animal, however. Once it\u2019s added to the atmosphere, it hangs around, for a long time: between 300 to 1,000 years. Thus, as humans change the atmosphere by emitting carbon dioxide, those changes will endure on the timescale of many human lives.\nEarth\u2019s atmosphere is associated with many types of cycles, such as the carbon cycle and the water cycle. Crisp says that while our atmosphere is very stable, those cycles aren\u2019t.\n\u201cHumanity\u2019s ability to thrive depends on these other planetary cycles and processes working the way they now do,\u201d he said. \u201cThanks to detailed observations of our planet from space, we\u2019ve seen some changes over the last 30 years that are quite alarming: changes in precipitation patterns, in where and how plants grow, in sea and land ice, in entire ecosystems like tropical rain forests. These changes should attract our attention.\n\u201cOne could say that because the atmosphere is so thin, the activity of 7.7 billion humans can actually make significant changes to the entire system,\u201d he added. \u201cThe composition of Earth\u2019s atmosphere has most certainly been altered. Half of the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations in the last 300 years has occurred since 1980, and one quarter of it since 2000. Methane concentrations have increased 2.5 times since the start of the Industrial Age, with almost all of that occurring since 1980. So changes are coming faster, and they\u2019re becoming more significant.\u201d\nThe concentration of carbon dioxide in Earth\u2019s atmosphere is currently at nearly 412 parts per million (ppm) and rising. This represents a 47 percent increase since the beginning of the Industrial Age, when the concentration was near 280 ppm, and an 11 percent increase since 2000, when it was near 370 ppm. Crisp points out that scientists know the increases in carbon dioxide are caused primarily by human activities because carbon produced by burning fossil fuels has a different ratio of heavy-to-light carbon atoms, so it leaves a distinct \u201cfingerprint\u201d that instruments can measure. A relative decline in the amount of heavy carbon-13 isotopes in the atmosphere points to fossil fuel sources. Burning fossil fuels also depletes oxygen and lowers the ratio of oxygen to nitrogen in the atmosphere.\nOCO-2, launched in July 2014, gathers global measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide with the resolution, precision and coverage needed to understand how this important greenhouse gas \u2014 the principal human-produced driver of climate change \u2014 moves through the Earth system at regional scales, and how it changes over time. From its vantage point in space, OCO-2 makes roughly 100,000 measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide every day.\nCrisp says OCO-2 has already provided new insights into the processes emitting carbon dioxide to the atmosphere and those that are absorbing it.\n\u201cFor as long as we can remember, we\u2019ve talked about Earth\u2019s tropical rainforests as the \u2018lungs\u2019 of our planet,\u201d he said. \u201cMost scientists considered them to be the principal absorber and storage place of carbon dioxide in the Earth system, with Earth\u2019s northern boreal forests playing a secondary role. But that\u2019s not what\u2019s being borne out by our data. We\u2019re seeing that Earth\u2019s tropical regions are a net source of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, at least since 2009. This changes our understanding of things.\u201d\nMeasurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide in the tropics are consistently higher than anything around them, and scientists don\u2019t know why, Crisp said. OCO-2 and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency\u2019s Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) are tracking plant growth in the tropics by observing solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) from chlorophyll in plants. SIF is an indicator of the rate at which plants convert light from the Sun and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into chemical energy.\n\u201cWe\u2019re finding that plant respiration is outstripping their ability to absorb carbon dioxide,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is happening throughout the tropics, and almost all of the time. When we first launched OCO-2, our first two years of on-orbit operations occurred during a strong El Ni\u00f1o event, which had a strong impact on global carbon dioxide emissions. Now we have more than five years of data, and we see that the tropics are always a source (of carbon dioxide), in every season. In fact, the only time we see significant absorption of carbon dioxide in the tropics is in Africa during June, July and August. So that\u2019s half the story.\n\u201cThe other half is also quite interesting,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing northern mid- and high-latitude rainforests becoming better and better absorbers for carbon dioxide over time.

An updated edition was eleased on June 11th.\nYou can also watch and share the conversation on X/Twitter, Facebook or LinkedIn.\nKoonin, who\u2019s joining the Hoover Institution this fall as a senior fellow, has a new op-ed out in the Wall Street Journal titled \u201cThe \u2018Climate Crisis\u2019 Fades Out.\u201d\nWe were joined by Roger Pielke Jr., a longtime climate policy analyst you\u2019ve seen here before. Read Roger Pielke Jr.\u2019s critique of Koonin\u2019s book (which largely tracks my views):\nPielke also debated Koonin last year on the question, \u201cIs Net Zero by 2050 Possible?\u201d\nKoonin\u2019s book, which was first published in 2021 and has, according to the publisher, sold some 200,000 copies, grew out of arguments he made in an opinion piece he wrote for The Wall Street Journal in 2014. I reached out to him at that time with a couple of questions and posted them and his answers on my Dot Earth blog.\nThe arguments in \u201cUnsettled\u201d largely sync with the points made a decade ago. Here\u2019s that post, which includes an open letter from a batch of Carnegie Mellon University scientists focused on climate and decisionmaking. Our conversation Tuesday will essentially pick up where we left off here:\nSteven E. Koonin, once the Obama administration\u2019s undersecretary of energy for science and chief scientist at BP, stirred up a swirl of turbulence in global warming discourse this week after The Wall Street Journal published \u201cClimate Science is Not Settled,\u201d his essay calling for more frankness about areas of deep uncertainty in climate science, more research to narrow error ranges and more acknowledgement that society\u2019s decisions on energy and climate policy are based on values as much as data. (The Journal seems to keep this headline on file; here\u2019s a 2009 essay, \u201cClimate Science Isn\u2019t Settled,\u201d by the M.I.T. climatologist Richard Lindzen.)\nPredictably, the piece by Koonin, who became the founding director of New York University\u2019s important Center for Urban Science and Progress in 2012, was quickly hailed by fossil fuel defenders. At the same time, some of Koonin\u2019s central points about the state of climate science were sharply challenged by climate scientists and climate campaigners. I was on the run at the time but sent Koonin a couple of questions, which I also posted on Tumblr.\nHere they are with his answers (with some email shorthand cleaned up), along with a fresh critique of Koonin\u2019s argument by a group of climate science and policy researchers associated with Carnegie Mellon University and a final thought from me:\nQ. Your piece makes the important point that, on vital questions, there\u2019s enduring deep uncertainty behind the \u201c97 Percent of Climate Scientists Agree\u201d headlines and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report summary language. That was the point of my pieces on the many \u201cshapes\u201d of climate knowledge.\nBut I think your piece implies too much that further scientific inquiry can improve the picture. On regional forecasting, extremes (hurricanes), sensitivity to doubled CO2, and other key questions, further science \u2014 if anything \u2014 has clarified that some of these uncertainties aren\u2019t going anywhere.\nA. I agree that regional and extremes are probably hopeless. But I would suppose that equilibrium climate sensitivity [background] and even global mean surface temperature on a decadal scale could be better nailed down by model pruning and better ocean data. An interesting way to test that (which I don\u2019t think has ever been done, but don\u2019t know for sure) is to assume one of the models is the truth, downscale the sampling of the data to what we might reasonably observe in the real world, and see to what extent that can be used to recover the truth. The results would give some indication of the extent to which more observations would help.\nQ. You also imply that you can\u2019t have \u201cgood\u201d climate policy in the face of deep persistent uncertainty. In other endeavors, society has figured this out and some sustained inquiry is going into how to take a least-regrets policy on the greenhouse buildup. See the World Bank paper on \u201cInvestment Decision Making under Deep Uncertainty \u2013 Application to Climate Change.\u201d\nA. This is indeed implied by the tagline [\u201cWe are very far from the knowledge needed to make good climate policy\u201d], which I didn\u2019t write or even see until publication. As I hoped to imply in the last few paragraphs of the article, we can get to good climate policies, but they will depend as much (or even more) upon \u201cvalues\u201d than upon science, given the latter\u2019s uncertainties.\nHere\u2019s the open letter written by nine scientists affiliated with the Center for Climate and Energy Decision Making at Carnegie Mellon:\n~ ~ ~\nUncertainty in Climate Science: Not an Excuse for Inaction\nOn Sunday, more than three hundred thousand people marched in New York City and around the world to urge governments to support an agreement to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that cause climate change. Then, on September 23, the United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon hosted the 2014 UN Climate Summit. There is hope that this meeting will catalyze leadership support for an agreement that enables a pathway to avoid large impacts from climate change.\nWhile the world waited for these events to unfold, on September 20 the Wall Street Journal published an editorial titled \u201cClimate Science is Not Settled.\u201d In this editorial, Steve E. Koonin, Undersecretary for Science in the Department of Energy during President Barack Obama\u2019s first term and current director of the Center for Urban Science and Progress at New York University, argued that while there is agreement that the climate is changing, there is no scientific agreement \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The reason comes down to physics ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAncient air bubbles trapped in ice enable us to step back in time and see what Earth's atmosphere, and climate, were like in the distant past. They tell us that levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere are higher than they have been at any time in the past 400,000 years. During ice ages, CO2 levels were around 200 parts per million (ppm), and during the warmer interglacial periods, they hovered around 280 ppm (see fluctuations in the graph). In 2013, CO2 levels surpassed 400 ppm for the first time in recorded history. This recent relentless rise in CO2 shows a remarkably constant relationship with fossil-fuel burning, and can be well accounted for based on the simple premise that about 60 percent of fossil-fuel emissions stay in the air.\nToday, we stand on the threshold of a new geologic era, which some term the \"Anthropocene\", one where the climate is very different to the one our ancestors knew.\nIf fossil-fuel burning continues at a business-as-usual rate, such that humanity exhausts the reserves over the next few centuries, CO2 will continue to rise to levels of order of 1500 ppm. The atmosphere would then not return to pre-industrial levels even tens of thousands of years into the future. This graph not only conveys the scientific measurements, but it also underscores the fact that humans have a great capacity to change the climate and planet.\nYou can also find this graphic on our \u201cEvidence\u201d page.\nDec 1, 2023\nJPEG (427.92 KB)\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

It is one of three main greenhouse gases in the atmosphere of Earth. The concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere reached 427 ppm (0.0427%) on a molar basis in 2024, representing 3341 gigatonnes of CO2.[1] This is an increase of 50% since the start of the Industrial Revolution, up from 280 ppm during the 10,000 years prior to the mid-18th century.[2][3][4] The increase is due to human activity.[5]\nThe current increase in CO2 concentrations is primarily driven by the burning of fossil fuels.[6] Other significant human activities that emit CO2 include cement production, deforestation, and biomass burning. The increase in atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases such as methane increase the absorption and emission of infrared radiation by the atmosphere. This has led to a rise in average global temperature and ocean acidification. Another direct effect is the CO2 fertilization effect. The increase in atmospheric concentrations of CO2 causes a range of further effects of climate change on the environment and human living conditions.\nCarbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. It absorbs and emits infrared radiation at its two infrared-active vibrational frequencies. The two wavelengths are 4.26 \u03bcm (2,347 cm\u22121) (antisymmetric stretching vibrational mode) and 14.99 \u03bcm (667 cm\u22121) (bending vibrational mode). CO2 plays a significant role in influencing Earth's surface temperature through the greenhouse effect.[7] Light emission from the Earth's surface is most intense in the infrared region between 200 and 2500 cm\u22121,[8] as opposed to light emission from the much hotter Sun which is most intense in the visible region. Absorption of infrared light at the vibrational frequencies of atmospheric CO2 traps energy near the surface, warming the surface of Earth and its lower atmosphere. Less energy reaches the upper atmosphere, which is therefore cooler because of this absorption.[9]\nThe present atmospheric concentration of CO2 is the highest for 14 million years.[10] Concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere were as high as 4,000 ppm during the Cambrian period about 500 million years ago, and as low as 180 ppm during the Quaternary glaciation of the last two million years.[2] Reconstructed temperature records for the last 420 million years indicate that atmospheric CO2 concentrations peaked at approximately 2,000 ppm. This peak happened during the Devonian period (400 million years ago). Another peak occurred in the Triassic period (220\u2013200 million years ago).[11]\nSince the start of the Industrial Revolution, atmospheric CO2 concentration has been increasing, causing global warming and ocean acidification.[12] In October 2023 the average level of CO2 in Earth's atmosphere, adjusted for seasonal variation, was 422.17 parts per million by volume (ppm).[13] Figures are published monthly by the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).[14][15] The value had been about 280 ppm during the 10,000 years up to the mid-18th century.[2][3][4]\nEach part per million of CO2 in the atmosphere represents approximately 2.13 gigatonnes of carbon, or 7.82 gigatonnes of CO2.[16]\nIt was pointed out in 2021 that \"the current rates of increase of the concentration of the major greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide) are unprecedented over at least the last 800,000 years\".[17]: 515\nAs of 2024, it is estimated that 2,650 gigatonnes of CO2 have been emitted by human activity since 1850, with annual emissions of 42 gigatonnes per year. About 1,050 gigatonnes remain in the atmosphere following absorption by oceans and land.[18]\nSome fraction (a projected 20\u201335%) of the fossil carbon transferred thus far will persist in the atmosphere as elevated CO2 levels for many thousands of years after these carbon transfer activities begin to subside.[19][20]\nAtmospheric CO2 concentrations fluctuate slightly with the seasons, falling during the Northern Hemisphere spring and summer as plants consume the gas and rising during northern autumn and winter as plants go dormant or die and decay. The level drops by about 6 or 7 ppm (about 50 Gt) from May to September during the Northern Hemisphere's growing season, and then goes up by about 8 or 9 ppm. The Northern Hemisphere dominates the annual cycle of CO2 concentration because it has much greater land area and plant biomass in mid-latitudes (30-60 degrees) than the Southern Hemisphere. Concentrations reach a peak in May as the Northern Hemisphere spring greenup begins, and decline to a minimum in October, near the end of the growing season.[21][22]\nConcentrations also vary on a regional basis, most strongly near the ground with much smaller variations aloft. In urban areas concentrations are generally higher[23] and indoors they can reach 10 times background levels.\nThe concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are expressed as parts per million by volume (abbreviated as ppmv, or ppm(v), or just ppm). To convert from the usual ppmv units to ppm mass (abbreviated as ppmm, or ppm(m)), multiply by the ratio of the molar mass of CO2 to that of air, i.e. times 1.52 (44.01 divided by 28.96).\nThe first reproducibly accurate measurements of atmospheric CO2 were from flask sample measurements made by Dave Keeling at Caltech in the 1950s.[32] Measurements at Mauna Loa have been ongoing since 1958. Additionally, measurements are also made at many other sites around the world. Many measurement sites are part of larger global networks. Global network data are often made publicly available.\nThere are several surface measurement (including flasks and continuous in situ) networks including NOAA/ERSL,[33] WDCGG,[34] and RAMCES.[35] The NOAA/ESRL Baseline Observatory Network, and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography Network[36] data are hosted at the CDIAC at ORNL.

Greenhouse gases trap the heat from sunlight, warming the planet. Without any greenhouse gases, Earth would be too cold to support life. But the more greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere, the warmer the planet becomes.\nCarbon dioxide comes from sources such as the burning of fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, and natural gas), wildfires, and volcanic eruptions. The graph shows atmospheric CO2 levels measured by NOAA at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, since 1958. It's important to note that \u201cparts per million\u201d refers to the number of carbon dioxide molecules per million molecules of dry air. The data shown are the latest available, updated monthly.\nThe second animated graph shows CO2 levels from an Antarctic ice core in combination with the observations from Mauna Loa Observatory. This extends the record back through Earth\u2019s last three glacial cycles. The Antarctic ice core measures CO2 levels trapped in tiny air bubbles from the past that were preserved when the ice formed.\nGround-based and satellite measurements have measured a sharp increase in atmospheric CO2 in recent decades. With a more than 50% increase in CO2 since the start of industrial times in the 18th century, scientific measurements have linked this increase primarily to the burning of coal, oil, and gas. This means that CO2 levels are now 150% the value they were at in 1750 \u2014 this is at least 1.5 times greater than the natural increase observed at the end of the last ice age 20,000 years ago, which happened over thousands of years.\nThe animated map below shows the historical changes in global carbon dioxide over time. Note the colors change as the amount of CO2 rises from 365 parts per million (ppm) in 2002 to over 420 ppm in 2022. These measurements from the AIRS instrument come from the mid-troposphere, the layer of Earth's atmosphere that is 8 to 12 kilometers (about 5 to 7 miles) above the ground.\nA closer look at the carbon dioxide measurements at Mauna Loa shows a series of wiggles in the data. Although total CO2 is increasing each year, there is also a short-term cycle visible within the larger trend.\nThis annual rise and fall of CO2 levels is caused by seasonal cycles in photosynthesis on a global scale. In Northern Hemisphere spring, plants come to life and draw in CO2 to fuel their growth. This begins the process of lowering the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. In northern autumn, plant growth stops or slows down, and the whole process reverses itself. Much of the plant matter decomposes, releasing CO2 back to the atmosphere.\nA similar but less intense pattern repeats in the Southern Hemisphere in opposite seasons. Spring growth starts in September and winter decomposition begins in March, so CO2 records in the Southern Hemisphere show the opposite pattern of that seen in Mauna Loa. However, because there is a lot more land and vegetation in the Northern Hemisphere than the southern, the global yearly cycle more closely aligns with the northern seasons.\nSee the cycle in action in the visualization Watching Earth Breathe: The Seasonal Vegetation Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide.\nThis cycle of plant growth gives the graph of CO2 a sawtooth pattern of ups and downs from year to year. At a larger scale, the upward climb of the trend line over the decades is caused by CO2 emissions, primarily from burning fossil fuels. Thus, the data illustrate both natural factors and human additions of CO2.\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

It's important to note that \u201cparts per million\u201d refers to the number of carbon dioxide molecules per million molecules of dry air. The data shown are the latest available, updated monthly.\nThe second animated graph shows CO2 levels from an Antarctic ice core in combination with the observations from Mauna Loa Observatory. This extends the record back through Earth\u2019s last three glacial cycles. The Antarctic ice core measures CO2 levels trapped in tiny air bubbles from the past that were preserved when the ice formed.\nGround-based and satellite measurements have measured a sharp increase in atmospheric CO2 in recent decades. With a more than 50% increase in CO2 since the start of industrial times in the 18th century, scientific measurements have linked this increase primarily to the burning of coal, oil, and gas. This means that CO2 levels are now 150% the value they were at in 1750 \u2014 this is at least 1.5 times greater than the natural increase observed at the end of the last ice age 20,000 years ago, which happened over thousands of years.\nThe animated map below shows the historical changes in global carbon dioxide over time. Note the colors change as the amount of CO2 rises from 365 parts per million (ppm) in 2002 to over 420 ppm in 2022. These measurements from the AIRS instrument come from the mid-troposphere, the layer of Earth's atmosphere that is 8 to 12 kilometers (about 5 to 7 miles) above the ground.\nA closer look at the carbon dioxide measurements at Mauna Loa shows a series of wiggles in the data. Although total CO2 is increasing each year, there is also a short-term cycle visible within the larger trend.\nThis annual rise and fall of CO2 levels is caused by seasonal cycles in photosynthesis on a global scale. In Northern Hemisphere spring, plants come to life and draw in CO2 to fuel their growth. This begins the process of lowering the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. In northern autumn, plant growth stops or slows down, and the whole process reverses itself. Much of the plant matter decomposes, releasing CO2 back to the atmosphere.\nA similar but less intense pattern repeats in the Southern Hemisphere in opposite seasons. Spring growth starts in September and winter decomposition begins in March, so CO2 records in the Southern Hemisphere show the opposite pattern of that seen in Mauna Loa. However, because there is a lot more land and vegetation in the Northern Hemisphere than the southern, the global yearly cycle more closely aligns with the northern seasons.\nSee the cycle in action in the visualization Watching Earth Breathe: The Seasonal Vegetation Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide.\nThis cycle of plant growth gives the graph of CO2 a sawtooth pattern of ups and downs from year to year. At a larger scale, the upward climb of the trend line over the decades is caused by CO2 emissions, primarily from burning fossil fuels. Thus, the data illustrate both natural factors and human additions of CO2.\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Here we extend the record to the last millennium using two independent estimates: a reconstruction from sedimentary paleohurricane records and a statistical model of hurricane activity using sea surface temperatures (SSTs). We find statistically significant agreement between the two estimates and the late 20th century hurricane frequency is within the range seen over the past millennium. Numerical simulations using a hurricane-permitting climate model suggest that hurricane activity was likely driven by endogenous climate variability and linked to anomalous SSTs of warm Atlantic and cold Pacific. Volcanic eruptions can induce peaks in hurricane activity, but such peaks would likely be too weak to be detected in the proxy record due to large endogenous variability.\nSubject terms: Palaeoclimate, Climate and Earth system modelling\nThe authors present two independent reconstructions and a model simulations of Atlantic hurricane activity over the last millennium and show that it is mainly driven by internal climate variability instead of external forcings.\nTropical cyclones (TCs), which are often referred to as hurricanes in the North Atlantic basin, are among the most destructive extreme weather systems. Hurricanes often bring damaging surges along coastal areas, heavy rainfall, and intense surface winds to both coastal and inland regions, all of which can lead to economic loss, fatalities, and suffering1\u20133. It is, therefore, of practical importance to understand the climatic drivers of hurricane variability and the response to climate change.\nObservations of past hurricane activity changes and their relation to climate drivers can help us better understand the climate-hurricane connection. Unfortunately, we only have a short period of reliable hurricane observations (mostly over the satellite era: 1970s\u2013present), making it difficult to constrain and validate current climate models. As such, confident detection of hurricane frequency changes and attribution to anthropogenic climate change over recent decades is not yet possible4\u20138, and the projected response of hurricanes to a future warming world is highly dependent on climate models or estimation methods6,9,10.\nAlthough instrumental records only extend back to the mid-19th century11,12, one can obtain evidence of earlier hurricane activity from paleohurricane archives. For example, sediment cores collected from coastal basins preserve coarse-grained sediment layers deposited by proximal passing hurricanes13\u201320. These reconstructions document how hurricane frequency has changed over the past several thousand years. Unfortunately, these proxies are site-specific and typically only record storms that pass within a certain radius of the site and that exceed a certain intensity threshold. In order to reconstruct regional or basin-scale activity, paleohurricane records must be compiled21, and we are aware of only one previous study that has compiled multiple paleohurricane sediment records into a basin-wide hurricane estimate22. The paleohurricane proxy network has been substantially enhanced since then (2009) by efforts to increase the density and geographic coverage of sites20 and also by producing new high-resolution records from coastal karst basins23\u201328. It is not yet clear whether or how these advances in paleotempestological archives improve the skill in reconstructing basin-wide Atlantic hurricane frequency.\nHere, we use the most updated network of high-resolution and well-dated sediment-based paleohurricane records23\u201326,29 (Fig. 1A, B) to produce a basin-scale estimate of North Atlantic TC frequency for the last millennium. Our estimate combines twelve regional sediment estimates spanning sites from the Caribbean Sea, the US Gulf Coast, and the US East Coast. We require that all proxies included in the compilation spanned at least 1000 years with multi-decadal resolution or higher. All records needed published criteria for storm event layers and machine-readable information about each record\u2019s age model. We compare this sediment proxy-based estimate to an independent SST-based statistical model for hurricane frequency11 produced using last millennium reanalysis (LMR) SSTs30,31. Our null hypothesis is that this SST-emulated hurricane frequency estimate is not correlated with the sediment proxy-based reconstruction. If this null hypothesis can be rejected, it is more likely that the two independent estimates of hurricane activity in the last millennium capture a cohesive signal that is representative of climate modulation.\nA Map of locations for all the sites contributing to the paleo-hurricane sedimentary archives.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.\nGiven the lack of a trend in hurricane frequency from the middle 19th century to the present day12,32, we also hypothesize that internal climate variability primarily drives hurricane variability over the last millennium. We test this hypothesis by investigating a millennium-long control simulation from the hurricane-permitting high-resolution climate mode\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

An updated edition was eleased on June 11th.\nYou can also watch and share the conversation on X/Twitter, Facebook or LinkedIn.\nKoonin, who\u2019s joining the Hoover Institution this fall as a senior fellow, has a new op-ed out in the Wall Street Journal titled \u201cThe \u2018Climate Crisis\u2019 Fades Out.\u201d\nWe were joined by Roger Pielke Jr., a longtime climate policy analyst you\u2019ve seen here before. Read Roger Pielke Jr.\u2019s critique of Koonin\u2019s book (which largely tracks my views):\nPielke also debated Koonin last year on the question, \u201cIs Net Zero by 2050 Possible?\u201d\nKoonin\u2019s book, which was first published in 2021 and has, according to the publisher, sold some 200,000 copies, grew out of arguments he made in an opinion piece he wrote for The Wall Street Journal in 2014. I reached out to him at that time with a couple of questions and posted them and his answers on my Dot Earth blog.\nThe arguments in \u201cUnsettled\u201d largely sync with the points made a decade ago. Here\u2019s that post, which includes an open letter from a batch of Carnegie Mellon University scientists focused on climate and decisionmaking. Our conversation Tuesday will essentially pick up where we left off here:\nSteven E. Koonin, once the Obama administration\u2019s undersecretary of energy for science and chief scientist at BP, stirred up a swirl of turbulence in global warming discourse this week after The Wall Street Journal published \u201cClimate Science is Not Settled,\u201d his essay calling for more frankness about areas of deep uncertainty in climate science, more research to narrow error ranges and more acknowledgement that society\u2019s decisions on energy and climate policy are based on values as much as data. (The Journal seems to keep this headline on file; here\u2019s a 2009 essay, \u201cClimate Science Isn\u2019t Settled,\u201d by the M.I.T. climatologist Richard Lindzen.)\nPredictably, the piece by Koonin, who became the founding director of New York University\u2019s important Center for Urban Science and Progress in 2012, was quickly hailed by fossil fuel defenders. At the same time, some of Koonin\u2019s central points about the state of climate science were sharply challenged by climate scientists and climate campaigners. I was on the run at the time but sent Koonin a couple of questions, which I also posted on Tumblr.\nHere they are with his answers (with some email shorthand cleaned up), along with a fresh critique of Koonin\u2019s argument by a group of climate science and policy researchers associated with Carnegie Mellon University and a final thought from me:\nQ. Your piece makes the important point that, on vital questions, there\u2019s enduring deep uncertainty behind the \u201c97 Percent of Climate Scientists Agree\u201d headlines and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report summary language. That was the point of my pieces on the many \u201cshapes\u201d of climate knowledge.\nBut I think your piece implies too much that further scientific inquiry can improve the picture. On regional forecasting, extremes (hurricanes), sensitivity to doubled CO2, and other key questions, further science \u2014 if anything \u2014 has clarified that some of these uncertainties aren\u2019t going anywhere.\nA. I agree that regional and extremes are probably hopeless. But I would suppose that equilibrium climate sensitivity [background] and even global mean surface temperature on a decadal scale could be better nailed down by model pruning and better ocean data. An interesting way to test that (which I don\u2019t think has ever been done, but don\u2019t know for sure) is to assume one of the models is the truth, downscale the sampling of the data to what we might reasonably observe in the real world, and see to what extent that can be used to recover the truth. The results would give some indication of the extent to which more observations would help.\nQ. You also imply that you can\u2019t have \u201cgood\u201d climate policy in the face of deep persistent uncertainty. In other endeavors, society has figured this out and some sustained inquiry is going into how to take a least-regrets policy on the greenhouse buildup. See the World Bank paper on \u201cInvestment Decision Making under Deep Uncertainty \u2013 Application to Climate Change.\u201d\nA. This is indeed implied by the tagline [\u201cWe are very far from the knowledge needed to make good climate policy\u201d], which I didn\u2019t write or even see until publication. As I hoped to imply in the last few paragraphs of the article, we can get to good climate policies, but they will depend as much (or even more) upon \u201cvalues\u201d than upon science, given the latter\u2019s uncertainties.\nHere\u2019s the open letter written by nine scientists affiliated with the Center for Climate and Energy Decision Making at Carnegie Mellon:\n~ ~ ~\nUncertainty in Climate Science: Not an Excuse for Inaction\nOn Sunday, more than three hundred thousand people marched in New York City and around the world to urge governments to support an agreement to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that cause climate change. Then, on September 23, the United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon hosted the 2014 UN Climate Summit. There is hope that this meeting will catalyze leadership support for an agreement that enables a pathway to avoid large impacts from climate change.\nWhile the world waited for these events to unfold, on September 20 the Wall Street Journal published an editorial titled \u201cClimate Science is Not Settled.\u201d In this editorial, Steve E. Koonin, Undersecretary for Science in the Department of Energy during President Barack Obama\u2019s first term and current director of the Center for Urban Science and Progress at New York University, argued that while there is agreement that the climate is changing, there is no scientific agreement \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

These events include: seventeen severe storm events (tornado outbreaks, high wind, hailstorms) five tropical cyclones, one wildfire, one drought/heat wave and two winter storm/cold wave events. This follows 2023 in which there were a record 28 separate billion-dollar events. The total cost from these 27 events in 2024 was $182.7 billion. This is our current cost estimates as of January 10th and may rise by several billion dollars as new data become available. The total cost of the last ten years (2015-2024) exceeds $1.4 trillion while the costs for 403 events from 1980-2024 exceeds $2.915 trillion (inflation-adjusted to 2024 dollars).\nThe National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) is the Nation's Scorekeeper in terms of addressing severe weather and climate events in their historical perspective. As part of its responsibility of monitoring and assessing the climate, NCEI tracks and evaluates climate events in the U.S. and globally that have great economic and societal impacts. NCEI is frequently called upon to provide summaries of global and U.S. temperature and precipitation trends, extremes, and comparisons in their historical perspective. The Billion-dollar disasters product update is a quantification of the weather and climate disasters that in 2024 led to more than $1 billion in collective damages for each event. It is intended to show the impact of extreme weather and climate events on the economy in inflation adjusted dollars and has no focus on climate event attribution. Caution should be used in interpreting trends based on this graphic for a variety of reasons. For example, inflation has affected our ability to compare costs over time. To reflect this, the graphic also shows events with less than $1 billion in damage at the time of the event, but after adjusting for inflation (Consumer Price Index), now exceed $1 billion in damages.\nA major driver of increased costs of extreme weather is the increase in population and material wealth over the last several decades. \"The intensification of these and other more extreme weather-climate events are intersecting with areas experiencing high levels of health disparities, social vulnerabilities, and increased exposure due to population growth in hazard-prone areas. Exposure to extreme weather and climate hazards in the Gulf of America state region is increasing as a result of population growth and increased construction of public and private development in hazard-prone areas\" (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. Compounding Disasters in Gulf Coast Communities 2020-2021: Impacts, Findings, and Lessons (2024)). Additionally, much of the growth and property development has continued taken place in vulnerable areas like coasts, the wildland-urban interface, and river floodplains. Increased building and population growth in areas at high risk of wildfires and hurricanes mean that more people and property are at risk and so also contribute to larger losses (CBO report on \"Climate Change, Disaster Risk, and Homeowner's Insurance\" (2024)). Approximately 42% of the contiguous United States (CONUS) population lives in coastal areas, which account for less than 10% of the total land area. However, there have been steady increases in coastal population density across CONUS despite historical flood loss events (Poudel et al, 2024). Areas where building codes are insufficient for reducing damage from extreme events are especially vulnerable to more expensive extreme weather (Multi-Hazard Mitigation Council report on Natural Hazard Mitigation Saves (2019). This is part of the reason that the 2010s decade is far costlier in the Billion-dollar disaster data set than the 2000s, 1990s, or 1980s, when adjusted for inflation to current dollars.\nLosses from the billion-dollar disasters tracked in this data set have averaged $140 billion per year over the last decade. 2017 was the costliest year, exceeding $300 billion - proportional to about 25 percent of the $1.3 trillion building value put in place that year (Multi-Hazard Mitigation Council, 2019). Since 1980, there have been changes in the frequency and intensity of some weather extremes that can lead to billion-dollar disasters. Drought has become more frequent, lengthening wildfire seasons in the Western states, and extremely heavy rainfall has become more common in the eastern states. Sea level rise can also worsen hurricane storm surge flooding, increasing the cost of a disaster (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. Compounding Disasters in Gulf Coast Communities 2020-2021: Impacts, Findings, and Lessons (2024); Fifth U.S. National Climate Assessment (2023); Multi-Hazard Mitigation Council. Natural Hazard Mitigation Saves (2019)).\nIn 2012, NCEI -- then known as National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) -- reviewed its methodology on how it develops Billion-dollar Disasters. NCEI held a workshop with economic experts (May, 2012) and worked with a consulting partner to examine possible inaccuracy and biases in the data sources and methodology used in developing the loss assessments (mid-2013). This ensures more consistency with the numbers NCEI provides on a yearly basis and give more confidence in the year-to-year comparison of information. Another outcome is a published peer-reviewed article \"U.S. Billion-dollar Weather and Climate Disasters: Data Sources, Trends, Accuracy and Biases\" (Smith and Katz, 2013). This research found the net effect of all biases appears to be an underestimation of average loss. In particular, it is shown that the factor approach can result in an underestimation of average loss of approximately 10\u201315%. This bias was corrected during a reanalysis of the loss data to reflect new loss totals.\nIt is also known that the uncer\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Greenhouse gases trap the heat from sunlight, warming the planet. Without any greenhouse gases, Earth would be too cold to support life. But the more greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere, the warmer the planet becomes.\nCarbon dioxide comes from sources such as the burning of fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, and natural gas), wildfires, and volcanic eruptions. The graph shows atmospheric CO2 levels measured by NOAA at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, since 1958. It's important to note that \u201cparts per million\u201d refers to the number of carbon dioxide molecules per million molecules of dry air. The data shown are the latest available, updated monthly.\nThe second animated graph shows CO2 levels from an Antarctic ice core in combination with the observations from Mauna Loa Observatory. This extends the record back through Earth\u2019s last three glacial cycles. The Antarctic ice core measures CO2 levels trapped in tiny air bubbles from the past that were preserved when the ice formed.\nGround-based and satellite measurements have measured a sharp increase in atmospheric CO2 in recent decades. With a more than 50% increase in CO2 since the start of industrial times in the 18th century, scientific measurements have linked this increase primarily to the burning of coal, oil, and gas. This means that CO2 levels are now 150% the value they were at in 1750 \u2014 this is at least 1.5 times greater than the natural increase observed at the end of the last ice age 20,000 years ago, which happened over thousands of years.\nThe animated map below shows the historical changes in global carbon dioxide over time. Note the colors change as the amount of CO2 rises from 365 parts per million (ppm) in 2002 to over 420 ppm in 2022. These measurements from the AIRS instrument come from the mid-troposphere, the layer of Earth's atmosphere that is 8 to 12 kilometers (about 5 to 7 miles) above the ground.\nA closer look at the carbon dioxide measurements at Mauna Loa shows a series of wiggles in the data. Although total CO2 is increasing each year, there is also a short-term cycle visible within the larger trend.\nThis annual rise and fall of CO2 levels is caused by seasonal cycles in photosynthesis on a global scale. In Northern Hemisphere spring, plants come to life and draw in CO2 to fuel their growth. This begins the process of lowering the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. In northern autumn, plant growth stops or slows down, and the whole process reverses itself. Much of the plant matter decomposes, releasing CO2 back to the atmosphere.\nA similar but less intense pattern repeats in the Southern Hemisphere in opposite seasons. Spring growth starts in September and winter decomposition begins in March, so CO2 records in the Southern Hemisphere show the opposite pattern of that seen in Mauna Loa. However, because there is a lot more land and vegetation in the Northern Hemisphere than the southern, the global yearly cycle more closely aligns with the northern seasons.\nSee the cycle in action in the visualization Watching Earth Breathe: The Seasonal Vegetation Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide.\nThis cycle of plant growth gives the graph of CO2 a sawtooth pattern of ups and downs from year to year. At a larger scale, the upward climb of the trend line over the decades is caused by CO2 emissions, primarily from burning fossil fuels. Thus, the data illustrate both natural factors and human additions of CO2.\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

These events include: seventeen severe storm events (tornado outbreaks, high wind, hailstorms) five tropical cyclones, one wildfire, one drought/heat wave and two winter storm/cold wave events. This follows 2023 in which there were a record 28 separate billion-dollar events. The total cost from these 27 events in 2024 was $182.7 billion. This is our current cost estimates as of January 10th and may rise by several billion dollars as new data become available. The total cost of the last ten years (2015-2024) exceeds $1.4 trillion while the costs for 403 events from 1980-2024 exceeds $2.915 trillion (inflation-adjusted to 2024 dollars).\nThe National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) is the Nation's Scorekeeper in terms of addressing severe weather and climate events in their historical perspective. As part of its responsibility of monitoring and assessing the climate, NCEI tracks and evaluates climate events in the U.S. and globally that have great economic and societal impacts. NCEI is frequently called upon to provide summaries of global and U.S. temperature and precipitation trends, extremes, and comparisons in their historical perspective. The Billion-dollar disasters product update is a quantification of the weather and climate disasters that in 2024 led to more than $1 billion in collective damages for each event. It is intended to show the impact of extreme weather and climate events on the economy in inflation adjusted dollars and has no focus on climate event attribution. Caution should be used in interpreting trends based on this graphic for a variety of reasons. For example, inflation has affected our ability to compare costs over time. To reflect this, the graphic also shows events with less than $1 billion in damage at the time of the event, but after adjusting for inflation (Consumer Price Index), now exceed $1 billion in damages.\nA major driver of increased costs of extreme weather is the increase in population and material wealth over the last several decades. \"The intensification of these and other more extreme weather-climate events are intersecting with areas experiencing high levels of health disparities, social vulnerabilities, and increased exposure due to population growth in hazard-prone areas. Exposure to extreme weather and climate hazards in the Gulf of America state region is increasing as a result of population growth and increased construction of public and private development in hazard-prone areas\" (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. Compounding Disasters in Gulf Coast Communities 2020-2021: Impacts, Findings, and Lessons (2024)). Additionally, much of the growth and property development has continued taken place in vulnerable areas like coasts, the wildland-urban interface, and river floodplains. Increased building and population growth in areas at high risk of wildfires and hurricanes mean that more people and property are at risk and so also contribute to larger losses (CBO report on \"Climate Change, Disaster Risk, and Homeowner's Insurance\" (2024)). Approximately 42% of the contiguous United States (CONUS) population lives in coastal areas, which account for less than 10% of the total land area. However, there have been steady increases in coastal population density across CONUS despite historical flood loss events (Poudel et al, 2024). Areas where building codes are insufficient for reducing damage from extreme events are especially vulnerable to more expensive extreme weather (Multi-Hazard Mitigation Council report on Natural Hazard Mitigation Saves (2019). This is part of the reason that the 2010s decade is far costlier in the Billion-dollar disaster data set than the 2000s, 1990s, or 1980s, when adjusted for inflation to current dollars.\nLosses from the billion-dollar disasters tracked in this data set have averaged $140 billion per year over the last decade. 2017 was the costliest year, exceeding $300 billion - proportional to about 25 percent of the $1.3 trillion building value put in place that year (Multi-Hazard Mitigation Council, 2019). Since 1980, there have been changes in the frequency and intensity of some weather extremes that can lead to billion-dollar disasters. Drought has become more frequent, lengthening wildfire seasons in the Western states, and extremely heavy rainfall has become more common in the eastern states. Sea level rise can also worsen hurricane storm surge flooding, increasing the cost of a disaster (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. Compounding Disasters in Gulf Coast Communities 2020-2021: Impacts, Findings, and Lessons (2024); Fifth U.S. National Climate Assessment (2023); Multi-Hazard Mitigation Council. Natural Hazard Mitigation Saves (2019)).\nIn 2012, NCEI -- then known as National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) -- reviewed its methodology on how it develops Billion-dollar Disasters. NCEI held a workshop with economic experts (May, 2012) and worked with a consulting partner to examine possible inaccuracy and biases in the data sources and methodology used in developing the loss assessments (mid-2013). This ensures more consistency with the numbers NCEI provides on a yearly basis and give more confidence in the year-to-year comparison of information. Another outcome is a published peer-reviewed article \"U.S. Billion-dollar Weather and Climate Disasters: Data Sources, Trends, Accuracy and Biases\" (Smith and Katz, 2013). This research found the net effect of all biases appears to be an underestimation of average loss. In particular, it is shown that the factor approach can result in an underestimation of average loss of approximately 10\u201315%. This bias was corrected during a reanalysis of the loss data to reflect new loss totals.\nIt is also known that the uncer\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Credit: NASA/USGS\nThe Greenland Ice Sheet has shed about one-fifth more ice mass in the past four decades than previously estimated, researchers at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California reported in a new paper. The majority of glaciers on the landmass have retreated significantly, and icebergs are falling into the ocean at an accelerating rate. This additional ice loss has had only an indirect impact on sea levels, but could hold implications for ocean circulation in the future.\nPublished in Nature on Jan. 17, the analysis offers a comprehensive look at retreat around the edges of the entire ice sheet from 1985 to 2022, drawing from nearly a quarter million pieces of satellite data on glacier positions. Of the 207 glaciers in the study, 179 retreated significantly since 1985, 27 held steady, and one advanced slightly.\nZachariae Isstrom, a glacier in northeast Greenland, retreated significantly between 1999 (left) and 2022 (right) as icebergs broke off at an accelerating rate. A recent study found that it lost 176 billion tons (160 billion metric tons) of ice from 1985 to 2022. Credit: NASA/USGS\nMost of the ice loss came from below sea level, in fjords on Greenland\u2019s periphery. Once occupied by ancient glacial ice, many of these deep coastal valleys have filled with seawater \u2013 meaning the ice that broke off made little net contribution to sea level. But the loss likely accelerated the movement of ice flowing down from higher elevations, which in turn added to sea level rise.\n\u201cWhen the ice at the end of a glacier calves and retreats, it\u2019s like pulling the plug out of the fjord, which lets ice drain into the ocean faster,\u201d said Chad Greene, a glacier scientist at JPL and the study\u2019s lead author.\nGet the Latest JPL News\nFor decades researchers have studied the Greenland Ice Sheet\u2019s direct contributions to global sea level rise through ice flow and melting. Scientists participating in the international Ice sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise (IMBIE) estimated that the ice sheet had lost 5,390 billion tons (4,890 billion metric tons) between 1992 and 2020, adding about 0.531 inches (13.5 millimeters) to global mean sea level, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\nBut the IMBIE measurements do not account for ice lost due to the retreat of terminal glaciers along the edges of Greenland. (These glacier edges were already in the water, whether submerged or floating.) The new study quantifies this amount: For the 1985 to 2022 period in the new paper, the ice sheet was estimated to have lost about 1,140 billion tons (1,034 billion metric tons) \u2013 21% more mass lost than in the IMBIE assessment.\nAlthough it doesn\u2019t add to sea levels, the additional ice represents a significant influx of fresh water to the ocean. Recent studies have suggested that changes in the salinity of the North Atlantic Ocean from melting icebergs could weaken the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, part of the global \u201cconveyor belt\u201d of currents that transport heat and salt around the ocean. This could influence weather patterns worldwide, as well as affect ecosystems, the authors said.\nIcebergs have tumbled from Greenland\u2019s glaciers for thousands of years as part of a natural cycle that typically balanced glacier growth in the winter with melting and retreat in the summer. The new study finds that ice retreat has far outpaced growth throughout the 21st century.\nThe researchers also found that Greenland\u2019s ice extent remained relatively steady from 1985 to 2000, then started a marked recession that continues to this day.\nThe data showed a glacier in northeast Greenland called Zachariae Isstrom lost the most ice, dropping 176 billion tons (160 billion metric tons) of mass due to retreat. It was followed by Jakobshavn Isbrae on the western coast, which lost an estimated 97 billion tons (88 billion metric tons), and Humboldt Gletscher in the northwest, which lost 96 billion tons (87 billion metric tons).\nOnly one glacier, Qajuuttap Sermia in southern Greenland, experienced any growth over the study period, but its gains were too small to offset the losses from other glaciers.\nThe researchers also found that glaciers with the largest seasonal fluctuations in the position of their ice front experienced the greatest overall retreat. The correlation suggests the glaciers that are most sensitive to warming each summer will be most impacted by climate change in the coming decades.\nThe discovery of a large-scale pattern of glacier retreat and its link to glacier sensitivity on seasonal time scales was the result of a big-data synthesis that looks at all parts of the ice sheet over time, said JPL cryosphere scientist Alex Gardner, a co-author of the paper. Scientists drew from five publicly available datasets that cumulatively tracked the month-to-month positions of 236,328 glacier edges as detected, either manually or by computer algorithms, in images collected by optical and radar satellites.\n\u201cPreviously, we had bits and pieces \u2013 lots of local studies,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cBut what this study offers is a systematic and comprehensive view that has led to some pretty significant insights that we didn\u2019t have about the ice sheet before.\u201d\nAndrew Wang / Jane J.

Judging from historical records dating back to the 1850s, hurricanes in the North Atlantic have become more frequent over the last 150 years.\nHowever, scientists have questioned whether this upward trend is a reflection of reality, or simply an artifact of lopsided record-keeping. If 19th-century storm trackers had access to 21st-century technology, would they have recorded more storms? This inherent uncertainty has kept scientists from relying on storm records, and the patterns within them, for clues to how climate influences storms.\nA new MIT study published today in Nature Communications has used climate modeling, rather than storm records, to reconstruct the history of hurricanes and tropical cyclones around the world. The study finds that North Atlantic hurricanes have indeed increased in frequency over the last 150 years, similar to what historical records have shown.\nIn particular, major hurricanes, and hurricanes in general, are more frequent today than in the past. And those that make landfall appear to have grown more powerful, carrying more destructive potential.\nCuriously, while the North Atlantic has seen an overall increase in storm activity, the same trend was not observed in the rest of the world. The study found that the frequency of tropical cyclones globally has not changed significantly in the last 150 years.\n\u201cThe evidence does point, as the original historical record did, to long-term increases in North Atlantic hurricane activity, but no significant changes in global hurricane activity,\u201d says study author Kerry Emanuel, the Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Atmospheric Science in MIT\u2019s Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences. \u201cIt certainly will change the interpretation of climate\u2019s effects on hurricanes \u2014 that it\u2019s really the regionality of the climate, and that something happened to the North Atlantic that\u2019s different from the rest of the globe. It may have been caused by global warming, which is not necessarily globally uniform.\u201d\nChance encounters\nThe most comprehensive record of tropical cyclones is compiled in a database known as the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS). This historical record includes modern measurements from satellites and aircraft that date back to the 1940s. The database\u2019s older records are based on reports from ships and islands that happened to be in a storm\u2019s path. These earlier records date back to 1851, and overall the database shows an increase in North Atlantic storm activity over the last 150 years.\n\u201cNobody disagrees that that\u2019s what the historical record shows,\u201d Emanuel says. \u201cOn the other hand, most sensible people don\u2019t really trust the historical record that far back in time.\u201d\nRecently, scientists have used a statistical approach to identify storms that the historical record may have missed. To do so, they consulted all the digitally reconstructed shipping routes in the Atlantic over the last 150 years and mapped these routes over modern-day hurricane tracks. They then estimated the chance that a ship would encounter or entirely miss a hurricane\u2019s presence. This analysis found a significant number of early storms were likely missed in the historical record. Accounting for these missed storms, they concluded that there was a chance that storm activity had not changed over the last 150 years.\nBut Emanuel points out that hurricane paths in the 19th century may have looked different from today\u2019s tracks. What\u2019s more, the scientists may have missed key shipping routes in their analysis, as older routes have not yet been digitized.\n\u201cAll we know is, if there had been a change (in storm activity), it would not have been detectable, using digitized ship records,\u201d Emanuel says \u201cSo I thought, there\u2019s an opportunity to do better, by not using historical data at all.\u201d\nSeeding storms\nInstead, he estimated past hurricane activity using dynamical downscaling \u2014 a technique that his group developed and has applied over the last 15 years to study climate\u2019s effect on hurricanes. The technique starts with a coarse global climate simulation and embeds within this model a finer-resolution model that simulates features as small as hurricanes. The combined models are then fed with real-world measurements of atmospheric and ocean conditions. Emanuel then scatters the realistic simulation with hurricane \u201cseeds\u201d and runs the simulation forward in time to see which seeds bloom into full-blown storms.\nFor the new study, Emanuel embedded a hurricane model into a climate \u201creanalysis\u201d \u2014 a type of climate model that combines observations from the past with climate simulations to generate accurate reconstructions of past weather patterns and climate conditions. He used a particular subset of climate reanalyses that only accounts for observations collected from the surface \u2014 for instance from ships, which have recorded weather conditions and sea surface temperatures consistently since the 1850s, as opposed to from satellites, which only began systematic monitoring in the 1970s.\n\u201cWe chose to use this approach to avoid any artificial trends brought about by the introduction of progressively different observations,\u201d Emanuel explains.\nHe ran an embedded hurricane model on three different climate reanalyses, simulating tropical cyclones around the world over the past 150 years. Across all three models, he observed \u201cunequivocal increases\u201d in North Atlantic hurricane activity.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been this quite large increase in activity in the Atlantic since the mid-19th century, which I didn\u2019t expect to see,\u201d Emanuel says.\nWithin this overall rise in storm activity, he also observed a \u201churricane drought\u201d \u2014 a period during the 1970s and 80s when the number of yearly hurricanes momentarily dropped. This pause in storm activity can also be seen in historical records, and Emanuel\u2019s group proposes a cause: sulfate aeroso\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

A recent study found that glacial retreat caused the Greenland Ice Sheet to lose one-fifth more mass than previously estimated. Credit: NASA/USGS\nThe Greenland Ice Sheet has shed about one-fifth more ice mass in the past four decades than previously estimated, researchers at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California reported in a new paper. The majority of glaciers on the landmass have retreated significantly, and icebergs are falling into the ocean at an accelerating rate. This additional ice loss has had only an indirect impact on sea levels, but could hold implications for ocean circulation in the future.\nPublished in Nature on Jan. 17, the analysis offers a comprehensive look at retreat around the edges of the entire ice sheet from 1985 to 2022, drawing from nearly a quarter million pieces of satellite data on glacier positions. Of the 207 glaciers in the study, 179 retreated significantly since 1985, 27 held steady, and one advanced slightly.\nZachariae Isstrom, a glacier in northeast Greenland, retreated significantly between 1999 (left) and 2022 (right) as icebergs broke off at an accelerating rate. A recent study found that it lost 176 billion tons (160 billion metric tons) of ice from 1985 to 2022. Credit: NASA/USGS\nMost of the ice loss came from below sea level, in fjords on Greenland\u2019s periphery. Once occupied by ancient glacial ice, many of these deep coastal valleys have filled with seawater \u2013 meaning the ice that broke off made little net contribution to sea level. But the loss likely accelerated the movement of ice flowing down from higher elevations, which in turn added to sea level rise.\n\u201cWhen the ice at the end of a glacier calves and retreats, it\u2019s like pulling the plug out of the fjord, which lets ice drain into the ocean faster,\u201d said Chad Greene, a glacier scientist at JPL and the study\u2019s lead author.\nGet the Latest JPL News\nFor decades researchers have studied the Greenland Ice Sheet\u2019s direct contributions to global sea level rise through ice flow and melting. Scientists participating in the international Ice sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise (IMBIE) estimated that the ice sheet had lost 5,390 billion tons (4,890 billion metric tons) between 1992 and 2020, adding about 0.531 inches (13.5 millimeters) to global mean sea level, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\nBut the IMBIE measurements do not account for ice lost due to the retreat of terminal glaciers along the edges of Greenland. (These glacier edges were already in the water, whether submerged or floating.) The new study quantifies this amount: For the 1985 to 2022 period in the new paper, the ice sheet was estimated to have lost about 1,140 billion tons (1,034 billion metric tons) \u2013 21% more mass lost than in the IMBIE assessment.\nAlthough it doesn\u2019t add to sea levels, the additional ice represents a significant influx of fresh water to the ocean. Recent studies have suggested that changes in the salinity of the North Atlantic Ocean from melting icebergs could weaken the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, part of the global \u201cconveyor belt\u201d of currents that transport heat and salt around the ocean. This could influence weather patterns worldwide, as well as affect ecosystems, the authors said.\nIcebergs have tumbled from Greenland\u2019s glaciers for thousands of years as part of a natural cycle that typically balanced glacier growth in the winter with melting and retreat in the summer. The new study finds that ice retreat has far outpaced growth throughout the 21st century.\nThe researchers also found that Greenland\u2019s ice extent remained relatively steady from 1985 to 2000, then started a marked recession that continues to this day.\nThe data showed a glacier in northeast Greenland called Zachariae Isstrom lost the most ice, dropping 176 billion tons (160 billion metric tons) of mass due to retreat. It was followed by Jakobshavn Isbrae on the western coast, which lost an estimated 97 billion tons (88 billion metric tons), and Humboldt Gletscher in the northwest, which lost 96 billion tons (87 billion metric tons).\nOnly one glacier, Qajuuttap Sermia in southern Greenland, experienced any growth over the study period, but its gains were too small to offset the losses from other glaciers.\nThe researchers also found that glaciers with the largest seasonal fluctuations in the position of their ice front experienced the greatest overall retreat. The correlation suggests the glaciers that are most sensitive to warming each summer will be most impacted by climate change in the coming decades.\nThe discovery of a large-scale pattern of glacier retreat and its link to glacier sensitivity on seasonal time scales was the result of a big-data synthesis that looks at all parts of the ice sheet over time, said JPL cryosphere scientist Alex Gardner, a co-author of the paper. Scientists drew from five publicly available datasets that cumulatively tracked the month-to-month positions of 236,328 glacier edges as detected, either manually or by computer algorithms, in images collected by optical and radar satellites.\n\u201cPreviously, we had bits and pieces \u2013 lots of local studies,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cBut what this study offers is a systematic and comprehensive view that has led to some pretty significant insights that we didn\u2019t have about the ice sheet before.\u201d\nAndrew Wang / Jane J.

Yes, But.\n\nGoogle Search Snippet:\nComparison of the number of named storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes in the Atlantic basin using the old 30-year (1981-2020) averaging ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nPOSTED ON JUNE 30, 2021 UPDATED ON JUNE 30, 2021\nChris Landsea and Eric Blake [1]\nThe 2020 Atlantic hurricane season was extremely active and destructive with 30 named storms. (The Hurricane Specialists here at the National Hurricane Center use the designation \u201cnamed storms\u201d to refer to tropical storms, subtropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes.) We even reached into the Greek alphabet for names for just the second time ever. The United States was affected by a record 13 named storms (six of them directly impacted Louisiana), and a record yearly total of 7 billion-dollar tropical cyclone damage events was recorded by the National Centers for Environmental Information (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/time-series/US). Nearly every country surrounding the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, and tropical/subtropical North Atlantic was threatened or struck in 2020. Total damage in the United States was around $42 billion with over 240 lives lost in the United States and our neighboring countries in the Caribbean and Central America.\nThe 30 named storms in 2020 sets a record going back to the 1870s when the U.S. Signal Service (a predecessor to the National Weather Service) began tracking tropical storms and hurricanes. The only year that comes close is 2005 with 28 named storms. It\u2019s also apparent that a very large increase has occurred in the number of observed named storms from an average of 7 to 10 a year in the late 1800s to an average of 15 to 18 a year in the last decade or so \u2013 a doubling in the observed numbers over a century! (The black curve in the figure below represents a smoothed representation of the data that filters out the year to year variability in order to focus on time scales of a decade or more).\nHowever, the number of named storms is only one measure of the overall measure of a season\u2019s activity. And indeed, for the 2020 season, other measures of Atlantic tropical storm and hurricane activity were not record breaking. For example, the number of hurricanes (14) was well above average, but fell short of the previous record of 15 hurricanes that occurred in 2005.\nFor overall monitoring of tropical storm and hurricane activity, tropical meteorologists prefer a metric that combines how strong the peak winds reached in a tropical cyclone, and how long they lasted \u2013 called Accumulated Cyclone Energy or ACE[2]. By this measure, 2020 was extremely busy, but not even close to record breaking. In fact, with a total ACE of 180 units, 2020 was only the 13th busiest season on record since 1878 with seasons like 1893, 1933, 1950, and 2005 substantially more active than 2020. One can also see that while there is a long-term increase in recorded ACE since the late 1800s, it\u2019s quite a bit less dramatic than the increase seen with named storms. There also is a pronounced busier/quieter multi-decadal (40- to 60-year) cycle with active conditions in the 1870s to 1890s, late 1920s to 1960s, and again from the mid-1990s onward. Conversely, quiet conditions occurred in the 1900s to early 1920s and 1970s to early 1990s.\nSo why would the record for named storms be broken in 2020, while the overall activity as measured by ACE is not even be close to setting a record?\nThe answer is very likely technology change, rather than climate change. Today we have many advanced tools to help monitor tropical and subtropical cyclones across the entire Atlantic basin such as geostationary and low-earth orbiting satellite imagery, the Hurricane Hunter aircraft of the U.S. Air Force Reserve and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), coastal weather radars, and scatterometers (radars in space that provide surface wind measurements). In addition, the instrumentation and measuring techniques used by the satellites, aircraft and radars are continually improving. These technological advances allow us at the National Hurricane Center to better identify, track, and forecast tropical and subtropical cyclones with an accuracy and precision never before available. This is great news for coastal residents and mariners, since these tools help us provide the best possible forecasts and warnings to aid in the best preparedness for these life-threatening systems.\nSuch technology, though, was not available back at the advent of the U.S. Signal Service\u2019s tropical monitoring in the 1870s. Without these sophisticated tools, meteorologists in earlier times not only had difficulty in forecasting tropical cyclones, but they also struggled in even knowing if a system existed over the open ocean. In the late 19th and early 20th Centuries, the only resource hurricane forecasters could use to monitor tropical cyclones were weather station observations provided via telegraph. Such an approach is problematic for observing \u2013 much less forecasting \u2013 tropical cyclones that develop and spend most of their lifecycle over the open ocean. Here\u2019s a timeline of critical technologies that have dramatically improved tropical meteorologists\u2019 ability to \u201csee\u201d and monitor tropical cyclones:\nThe upshot of all of these advances in the last century is much better identification of the existence of tropical cyclones and their strongest winds (or what meteorologists call \u201cIntensity\u201d). So, the further one goes back in time, the more tropical cyclones (and portions of their life cycle) were missed, even for systems that may have been a major hurricane. This holds for both counting named storms back in time as well as integrated measures like ACE. Our database is incomplete and has \u2013 as statisticians would say \u2013 a severe undersampling bias that is much more prominent earlier in the record. HURDAT2 \u2013 our Atlantic hurricane database \u2013 is an extremely helpful record which is a \u201cby-product\u201d of NHC\u2019s forecasting operations, but it is very deficient for determining real long-term trends.

During ice ages, CO2 levels were around 200 parts per million (ppm), and during the warmer interglacial periods, they hovered around 280 ppm (see fluctuations in the graph). In 2013, CO2 levels surpassed 400 ppm for the first time in recorded history. This recent relentless rise in CO2 shows a remarkably constant relationship with fossil-fuel burning, and can be well accounted for based on the simple premise that about 60 percent of fossil-fuel emissions stay in the air.\nToday, we stand on the threshold of a new geologic era, which some term the \"Anthropocene\", one where the climate is very different to the one our ancestors knew.\nIf fossil-fuel burning continues at a business-as-usual rate, such that humanity exhausts the reserves over the next few centuries, CO2 will continue to rise to levels of order of 1500 ppm.

Heat waves can lead to illness and death, particularly among older adults, the very young, and other vulnerable populations (see the Heat-Related Deaths and Heat-Related Illnesses indicators).1 People can also die from exposure to extreme cold (hypothermia). In addition, prolonged exposure to excessive heat and cold can damage crops and injure or kill livestock. Extreme heat can lead to power outages as heavy demands for air conditioning strain the power grid, while extremely cold weather increases the need for heating fuel.\nRecord-setting daily temperatures, heat waves, and cold spells are a natural part of day-to-day variation in weather. As the Earth\u2019s climate warms overall, however, heat waves are expected to become more frequent, longer, and more intense.2,3 Higher heat index values (which combine temperature and humidity to describe perceived temperature) are expected to increase discomfort and aggravate health issues. Conversely, cold spells are expected to decrease. In most locations, scientists expect daily minimum temperatures\u2014which typically occur at night\u2014to become warmer at a faster rate than daily maximum temperatures.4 This change will provide less opportunity to cool off and recover from daytime heat.\nThis indicator examines trends in unusual temperatures from several perspectives:\nThe data come from thousands of weather stations across the United States. National patterns can be determined by dividing the country into a grid and examining the data for one station in each cell of the grid. This method ensures that the results are not biased toward regions that happen to have many stations close together.\nFigure 1 shows the U.S. Annual Heat Wave Index, which tracks the occurrence of heat wave conditions across the contiguous 48 states from 1895 to 2015. While there is no universal definition of a heat wave, this index defines a heat wave as a period lasting at least four days with an average temperature that would only be expected to occur once every 10 years, based on the historical record. The index value for a given year depends on how often heat waves occur and how widespread they are.\nFigures 2 and 3 show trends in the percentage of the country\u2019s area experiencing unusually hot temperatures in the summer and unusually cold temperatures in the winter. These graphs are based on daily maximum temperatures, which usually occur during the day, and daily minimum temperatures, which usually occur at night. At each station, the recorded highs and lows are compared with the full set of historical records. After averaging over a particular month or season of interest, the coldest 10 percent of years are considered \u201cunusually cold\u201d and the warmest 10 percent are \u201cunusually hot.\u201d For example, if last year\u2019s summer highs were the 10th warmest on record for a particular location with more than 100 years of data, that year\u2019s summer highs would be considered unusually warm. Data are available from 1910 to 2015 for summer (June through August) and from 1911 to 2016 for winter (December of the previous year through February).\nFigures 4 and 5 show how trends in unusually hot and cold daily temperatures throughout the year vary by location. These maps cover 1,100 weather stations that have operated since 1948. Figure 4 was created by reviewing all daily maximum temperatures from 1948 to 2015 and identifying the 95th percentile temperature (a temperature that one would only expect to exceed in five days out of every 100) at each station. Next, for each year, the total number of days with maximum temperatures higher than the 95th percentile (that is, unusually hot days) was determined. The map shows how the total number of unusually hot days per year at each station has changed over time. Figure 5 is similar except that it looks at unusually cold days, based on the 5th percentile of daily minimum temperatures.\nMany people are familiar with record daily high and low temperatures, which are frequently mentioned in weather reports. Figure 6 depicts trends in these records by comparing the number of record-setting highs with the number of record-setting lows by decade. These data come from a set of weather stations that have collected data consistently since 1950.\nTemperature data are less certain for the early part of the 20th century because fewer stations were operating at that time. In addition, measuring devices and methods have changed over time, and some stations have moved. The data have been adjusted to the extent possible to account for some of these influences and biases, however, and these uncertainties are not sufficient to change the fundamental trends shown in the figures.\nThe data for this indicator are based on measurements from weather stations managed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Figure 1 uses data from the National Weather Service Cooperative Observer Network. Figures 2 and 3 come from the U.S. Climate Extremes Index, which is based on a smaller group of long-term weather stations that are tracked by the National Centers for Environmental Information and referred to as the U.S. Historical Climatology Network. Figures 4 and 5 use data from a somewhat larger set of stations tracked by the National Centers for Environmental Information, known as the Global Historical Climat\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This paper shows that the climate change that takes place due to increases in carbon dioxide concentration is largely irreversible for 1,000 years after emissions stop. Following cessation of emissions, removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide decreases radiative forcing, but is largely compensated by slower loss of heat to the ocean, so that atmospheric temperatures do not drop significantly for at least 1,000 years. Among illustrative irreversible impacts that should be expected if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations increase from current levels near 385 parts per million by volume (ppmv) to a peak of 450\u2013600 ppmv over the coming century are irreversible dry-season rainfall reductions in several regions comparable to those of the \u201cdust bowl\u201d era and inexorable sea level rise. Thermal expansion of the warming ocean provides a conservative lower limit to irreversible global average sea level rise of at least 0.4\u20131.0 m if 21st century CO2 concentrations exceed 600 ppmv and 0.6\u20131.9 m for peak CO2 concentrations exceeding \u22481,000 ppmv. Additional contributions from glaciers and ice sheet contributions to future sea level rise are uncertain but may equal or exceed several meters over the next millennium or longer.\nKeywords: dangerous interference, precipitation, sea level rise, warming\nOver the 20th century, the atmospheric concentrations of key greenhouse gases increased due to human activities. The stated objective (Article 2) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is to achieve stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a low enough level to prevent \u201cdangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.\u201d Many studies have focused on projections of possible 21st century dangers (1\u20133). However, the principles (Article 3) of the UNFCCC specifically emphasize \u201cthreats of serious or irreversible damage,\u201d underscoring the importance of the longer term. While some irreversible climate changes such as ice sheet collapse are possible but highly uncertain (1, 4), others can now be identified with greater confidence, and examples among the latter are presented in this paper. It is not generally appreciated that the atmospheric temperature increases caused by rising carbon dioxide concentrations are not expected to decrease significantly even if carbon emissions were to completely cease (5\u20137) (see Fig. 1). Future carbon dioxide emissions in the 21st century will hence lead to adverse climate changes on both short and long time scales that would be essentially irreversible (where irreversible is defined here as a time scale exceeding the end of the millennium in year 3000; note that we do not consider geo-engineering measures that might be able to remove gases already in the atmosphere or to introduce active cooling to counteract warming). For the same reason, the physical climate changes that are due to anthropogenic carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere today are expected to be largely irreversible. Such climate changes will lead to a range of damaging impacts in different regions and sectors, some of which occur promptly in association with warming, while others build up under sustained warming because of the time lags of the processes involved. Here we illustrate 2 such aspects of the irreversibly altered world that should be expected. These aspects are among reasons for concern but are not comprehensive; other possible climate impacts include Arctic sea ice retreat, increases in heavy rainfall and flooding, permafrost melt, loss of glaciers and snowpack with attendant changes in water supply, increased intensity of hurricanes, etc. A complete climate impacts review is presented elsewhere (8) and is beyond the scope of this paper. We focus on illustrative adverse and irreversible climate impacts for which 3 criteria are met: (i) observed changes are already occurring and there is evidence for anthropogenic contributions to these changes, (ii) the phenomenon is based upon physical principles thought to be well understood, and (iii) projections are available and are broadly robust across models.\nCarbon dioxide and global mean climate system changes (relative to preindustrial conditions in 1765) from 1 illustrative model, the Bern 2.5CC EMIC, whose results are comparable to the suite of assessed EMICs (5, 7). Climate system responses are shown for a ramp of CO2 emissions at a rate of 2%/year to peak CO2 values of 450, 550, 650, 750, 850, and 1200 ppmv, followed by zero emissions. The rate of global fossil fuel CO2 emission grew at \u22481%/year from 1980 to 2000 and >3%/year in the period from 2000 to 2005 (13). Results have been smoothed using an 11-year running mean. The 31-year variation seen in the carbon dioxide time series is introduced by the climatology used to force the terrestrial biosphere model (15). (Top) Falloff of CO2 concentrations following zero emissions after the peak. (Middle) Globally averaged surface warming (degrees Celsius) for these cases (note that this model has an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 3.2 \u00b0C for carbon dioxide doubling). Warming over land is expected to be larger than these global averaged values, with the greatest warming expected in the Arctic (5). (Bottom) Sea level rise (meters) from thermal expansion only (not including loss of glaciers, ice caps, or ice sheets).\nAdvances in modeling have led not only to improvements in complex Atmosphere\u2013Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) for projecting 21st century climate, but also to the implementation of Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity (EMICs) for millennial time scales. These 2 types of models are used in this paper to show how different peak carbon dioxide concentrations that could be attained in the 21st century are expected to lea\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

We focus on illustrative adverse and irreversible climate impacts for which 3 criteria are met: (i) observed changes are already occurring and there is evidence for anthropogenic contributions to these changes, (ii) the phenomenon is based upon physical principles thought to be well understood, and (iii) projections are available and are broadly robust across models.\nCarbon dioxide and global mean climate system changes (relative to preindustrial conditions in 1765) from 1 illustrative model, the Bern 2.5CC EMIC, whose results are comparable to the suite of assessed EMICs (5, 7). Climate system responses are shown for a ramp of CO2 emissions at a rate of 2%/year to peak CO2 values of 450, 550, 650, 750, 850, and 1200 ppmv, followed by zero emissions. The rate of global fossil fuel CO2 emission grew at \u22481%/year from 1980 to 2000 and >3%/year in the period from 2000 to 2005 (13). Results have been smoothed using an 11-year running mean. The 31-year variation seen in the carbon dioxide time series is introduced by the climatology used to force the terrestrial biosphere model (15). (Top) Falloff of CO2 concentrations following zero emissions after the peak. (Middle) Globally averaged surface warming (degrees Celsius) for these cases (note that this model has an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 3.2 \u00b0C for carbon dioxide doubling). Warming over land is expected to be larger than these global averaged values, with the greatest warming expected in the Arctic (5). (Bottom) Sea level rise (meters) from thermal expansion only (not including loss of glaciers, ice caps, or ice sheets).\nAdvances in modeling have led not only to improvements in complex Atmosphere\u2013Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) for projecting 21st century climate, but also to the implementation of Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity (EMICs) for millennial time scales. These 2 types of models are used in this paper to show how different peak carbon dioxide concentrations that could be attained in the 21st century are expected to lea\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Heat waves can lead to illness and death, particularly among older adults, the very young, and other vulnerable populations (see the Heat-Related Deaths and Heat-Related Illnesses indicators).1 People can also die from exposure to extreme cold (hypothermia). In addition, prolonged exposure to excessive heat and cold can damage crops and injure or kill livestock. Extreme heat can lead to power outages as heavy demands for air conditioning strain the power grid, while extremely cold weather increases the need for heating fuel.\nRecord-setting daily temperatures, heat waves, and cold spells are a natural part of day-to-day variation in weather. As the Earth\u2019s climate warms overall, however, heat waves are expected to become more frequent, longer, and more intense.2,3 Higher heat index values (which combine temperature and humidity to describe perceived temperature) are expected to increase discomfort and aggravate health issues. Conversely, cold spells are expected to decrease. In most locations, scientists expect daily minimum temperatures\u2014which typically occur at night\u2014to become warmer at a faster rate than daily maximum temperatures.4 This change will provide less opportunity to cool off and recover from daytime heat.\nThis indicator examines trends in unusual temperatures from several perspectives:\nThe data come from thousands of weather stations across the United States. National patterns can be determined by dividing the country into a grid and examining the data for one station in each cell of the grid. This method ensures that the results are not biased toward regions that happen to have many stations close together.\nFigure 1 shows the U.S. Annual Heat Wave Index, which tracks the occurrence of heat wave conditions across the contiguous 48 states from 1895 to 2015. While there is no universal definition of a heat wave, this index defines a heat wave as a period lasting at least four days with an average temperature that would only be expected to occur once every 10 years, based on the historical record. The index value for a given year depends on how often heat waves occur and how widespread they are.\nFigures 2 and 3 show trends in the percentage of the country\u2019s area experiencing unusually hot temperatures in the summer and unusually cold temperatures in the winter. These graphs are based on daily maximum temperatures, which usually occur during the day, and daily minimum temperatures, which usually occur at night. At each station, the recorded highs and lows are compared with the full set of historical records. After averaging over a particular month or season of interest, the coldest 10 percent of years are considered \u201cunusually cold\u201d and the warmest 10 percent are \u201cunusually hot.\u201d For example, if last year\u2019s summer highs were the 10th warmest on record for a particular location with more than 100 years of data, that year\u2019s summer highs would be considered unusually warm. Data are available from 1910 to 2015 for summer (June through August) and from 1911 to 2016 for winter (December of the previous year through February).\nFigures 4 and 5 show how trends in unusually hot and cold daily temperatures throughout the year vary by location. These maps cover 1,100 weather stations that have operated since 1948. Figure 4 was created by reviewing all daily maximum temperatures from 1948 to 2015 and identifying the 95th percentile temperature (a temperature that one would only expect to exceed in five days out of every 100) at each station. Next, for each year, the total number of days with maximum temperatures higher than the 95th percentile (that is, unusually hot days) was determined. The map shows how the total number of unusually hot days per year at each station has changed over time. Figure 5 is similar except that it looks at unusually cold days, based on the 5th percentile of daily minimum temperatures.\nMany people are familiar with record daily high and low temperatures, which are frequently mentioned in weather reports. Figure 6 depicts trends in these records by comparing the number of record-setting highs with the number of record-setting lows by decade. These data come from a set of weather stations that have collected data consistently since 1950.\nTemperature data are less certain for the early part of the 20th century because fewer stations were operating at that time. In addition, measuring devices and methods have changed over time, and some stations have moved. The data have been adjusted to the extent possible to account for some of these influences and biases, however, and these uncertainties are not sufficient to change the fundamental trends shown in the figures.\nThe data for this indicator are based on measurements from weather stations managed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Figure 1 uses data from the National Weather Service Cooperative Observer Network. Figures 2 and 3 come from the U.S. Climate Extremes Index, which is based on a smaller group of long-term weather stations that are tracked by the National Centers for Environmental Information and referred to as the U.S. Historical Climatology Network.

Due to extreme warming above the Arctic circle, the Greenland Ice Sheet melting rate has drastically accelerated, which is expected to continue into the future.\n\u2014\nGreenland Ice Sheet: Facts\nThe Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) holds enough water to raise average global sea levels by 7.4 metres. It has been losing mass for the past few decades due to surface meltwater runoff and the loss of water adjacent blocks of ice, termed ice discharge.\nGrIS meltwater runoff has accelerated since the early 2000s, largely due to atmospheric and oceanic warming. The average winter near-surface air temperature rose 2.8\u00b0C over the 100-year period from 1911 to 2012. A recent study observed that discharge increases by 4-5% per mean kilometre of glacier retreat. This means that the more GrIS melts, the quicker its discharge, whose rate is 14% higher today than during 1985-1999.\nGreenland Ice Sheet: Its History\nSince 1978, Arctic sea ice extent has visibly decreased for all months of the year, with a reduction of around 10 to 12% per decade in the month of September (yearly low).\nFigure 2. Comparison of sea ice cover in Greenland between September 1980 and September 2012 (data: Copernicus data hub).\nFrom 2006 to 2015, the Greenland ice sheet lost ice mass at an average rate of around 270 gigatons per year. To put that into perspective:\nAnd in 2019, the GrIS lost a record amount of ice at 532 gigatons, easily surpassing the previous 2012 record of 464 gigatons.\nWhat are the potential impacts of the Greenland Ice Sheet melting?\nSo far we have just considered Greenland\u2019s ice sheet. This, combined with a rapid breakup of West Antarctic ice sheets could result in up to 5m of sea level rise by the end of the century (although this is the worst case scenario imaginable).\nThis would disproportionately affect developing countries, particularly Vietnam, Egypt and the Bahamas. Places like West Africa are already feeling the bite.\nAs a final bombshell, if we ignore ice sheet instability then it is estimated that sea levels will still rise by 1 \u2013 2 m resulting in the forced displacement of up to 630 million people, 70% of which will come from just 8 countries in Asia (for more on this, check out our Sea Level Rise by 2100 series here).\nSource: https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2017/nov/03/three-degree-world-cities-drowned-global-warming.\nArticle written by Steven Vuong and Owen Mulhern.\nYou might also like: Sea Level Rise by 2100 \u2013 Miami\nThe best environmental stories of the week and month, handpicked by our Editor.

An updated edition was eleased on June 11th.\nYou can also watch and share the conversation on X/Twitter, Facebook or LinkedIn.\nKoonin, who\u2019s joining the Hoover Institution this fall as a senior fellow, has a new op-ed out in the Wall Street Journal titled \u201cThe \u2018Climate Crisis\u2019 Fades Out.\u201d\nWe were joined by Roger Pielke Jr., a longtime climate policy analyst you\u2019ve seen here before. Read Roger Pielke Jr.\u2019s critique of Koonin\u2019s book (which largely tracks my views):\nPielke also debated Koonin last year on the question, \u201cIs Net Zero by 2050 Possible?\u201d\nKoonin\u2019s book, which was first published in 2021 and has, according to the publisher, sold some 200,000 copies, grew out of arguments he made in an opinion piece he wrote for The Wall Street Journal in 2014. I reached out to him at that time with a couple of questions and posted them and his answers on my Dot Earth blog.\nThe arguments in \u201cUnsettled\u201d largely sync with the points made a decade ago. Here\u2019s that post, which includes an open letter from a batch of Carnegie Mellon University scientists focused on climate and decisionmaking. Our conversation Tuesday will essentially pick up where we left off here:\nSteven E. Koonin, once the Obama administration\u2019s undersecretary of energy for science and chief scientist at BP, stirred up a swirl of turbulence in global warming discourse this week after The Wall Street Journal published \u201cClimate Science is Not Settled,\u201d his essay calling for more frankness about areas of deep uncertainty in climate science, more research to narrow error ranges and more acknowledgement that society\u2019s decisions on energy and climate policy are based on values as much as data. (The Journal seems to keep this headline on file; here\u2019s a 2009 essay, \u201cClimate Science Isn\u2019t Settled,\u201d by the M.I.T. climatologist Richard Lindzen.)\nPredictably, the piece by Koonin, who became the founding director of New York University\u2019s important Center for Urban Science and Progress in 2012, was quickly hailed by fossil fuel defenders. At the same time, some of Koonin\u2019s central points about the state of climate science were sharply challenged by climate scientists and climate campaigners. I was on the run at the time but sent Koonin a couple of questions, which I also posted on Tumblr.\nHere they are with his answers (with some email shorthand cleaned up), along with a fresh critique of Koonin\u2019s argument by a group of climate science and policy researchers associated with Carnegie Mellon University and a final thought from me:\nQ. Your piece makes the important point that, on vital questions, there\u2019s enduring deep uncertainty behind the \u201c97 Percent of Climate Scientists Agree\u201d headlines and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report summary language. That was the point of my pieces on the many \u201cshapes\u201d of climate knowledge.\nBut I think your piece implies too much that further scientific inquiry can improve the picture. On regional forecasting, extremes (hurricanes), sensitivity to doubled CO2, and other key questions, further science \u2014 if anything \u2014 has clarified that some of these uncertainties aren\u2019t going anywhere.\nA. I agree that regional and extremes are probably hopeless. But I would suppose that equilibrium climate sensitivity [background] and even global mean surface temperature on a decadal scale could be better nailed down by model pruning and better ocean data. An interesting way to test that (which I don\u2019t think has ever been done, but don\u2019t know for sure) is to assume one of the models is the truth, downscale the sampling of the data to what we might reasonably observe in the real world, and see to what extent that can be used to recover the truth. The results would give some indication of the extent to which more observations would help.\nQ. You also imply that you can\u2019t have \u201cgood\u201d climate policy in the face of deep persistent uncertainty. In other endeavors, society has figured this out and some sustained inquiry is going into how to take a least-regrets policy on the greenhouse buildup. See the World Bank paper on \u201cInvestment Decision Making under Deep Uncertainty \u2013 Application to Climate Change.\u201d\nA. This is indeed implied by the tagline [\u201cWe are very far from the knowledge needed to make good climate policy\u201d], which I didn\u2019t write or even see until publication. As I hoped to imply in the last few paragraphs of the article, we can get to good climate policies, but they will depend as much (or even more) upon \u201cvalues\u201d than upon science, given the latter\u2019s uncertainties.\nHere\u2019s the open letter written by nine scientists affiliated with the Center for Climate and Energy Decision Making at Carnegie Mellon:\n~ ~ ~\nUncertainty in Climate Science: Not an Excuse for Inaction\nOn Sunday, more than three hundred thousand people marched in New York City and around the world to urge governments to support an agreement to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that cause climate change. Then, on September 23, the United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon hosted the 2014 UN Climate Summit. There is hope that this meeting will catalyze leadership support for an agreement that enables a pathway to avoid large impacts from climate change.\nWhile the world waited for these events to unfold, on September 20 the Wall Street Journal published an editorial titled \u201cClimate Science is Not Settled.\u201d In this editorial, Steve E. Koonin, Undersecretary for Science in the Department of Energy during President Barack Obama\u2019s first term and current director of the Center for Urban Science and Progress at New York University, argued that while there is agreement that the climate is changing, there is no scientific agreement \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

These events include: seventeen severe storm events (tornado outbreaks, high wind, hailstorms) five tropical cyclones, one wildfire, one drought/heat wave and two winter storm/cold wave events. This follows 2023 in which there were a record 28 separate billion-dollar events. The total cost from these 27 events in 2024 was $182.7 billion. This is our current cost estimates as of January 10th and may rise by several billion dollars as new data become available. The total cost of the last ten years (2015-2024) exceeds $1.4 trillion while the costs for 403 events from 1980-2024 exceeds $2.915 trillion (inflation-adjusted to 2024 dollars).\nThe National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) is the Nation's Scorekeeper in terms of addressing severe weather and climate events in their historical perspective. As part of its responsibility of monitoring and assessing the climate, NCEI tracks and evaluates climate events in the U.S. and globally that have great economic and societal impacts. NCEI is frequently called upon to provide summaries of global and U.S. temperature and precipitation trends, extremes, and comparisons in their historical perspective. The Billion-dollar disasters product update is a quantification of the weather and climate disasters that in 2024 led to more than $1 billion in collective damages for each event. It is intended to show the impact of extreme weather and climate events on the economy in inflation adjusted dollars and has no focus on climate event attribution. Caution should be used in interpreting trends based on this graphic for a variety of reasons. For example, inflation has affected our ability to compare costs over time. To reflect this, the graphic also shows events with less than $1 billion in damage at the time of the event, but after adjusting for inflation (Consumer Price Index), now exceed $1 billion in damages.\nA major driver of increased costs of extreme weather is the increase in population and material wealth over the last several decades. \"The intensification of these and other more extreme weather-climate events are intersecting with areas experiencing high levels of health disparities, social vulnerabilities, and increased exposure due to population growth in hazard-prone areas. Exposure to extreme weather and climate hazards in the Gulf of America state region is increasing as a result of population growth and increased construction of public and private development in hazard-prone areas\" (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. Compounding Disasters in Gulf Coast Communities 2020-2021: Impacts, Findings, and Lessons (2024)). Additionally, much of the growth and property development has continued taken place in vulnerable areas like coasts, the wildland-urban interface, and river floodplains. Increased building and population growth in areas at high risk of wildfires and hurricanes mean that more people and property are at risk and so also contribute to larger losses (CBO report on \"Climate Change, Disaster Risk, and Homeowner's Insurance\" (2024)). Approximately 42% of the contiguous United States (CONUS) population lives in coastal areas, which account for less than 10% of the total land area. However, there have been steady increases in coastal population density across CONUS despite historical flood loss events (Poudel et al, 2024). Areas where building codes are insufficient for reducing damage from extreme events are especially vulnerable to more expensive extreme weather (Multi-Hazard Mitigation Council report on Natural Hazard Mitigation Saves (2019). This is part of the reason that the 2010s decade is far costlier in the Billion-dollar disaster data set than the 2000s, 1990s, or 1980s, when adjusted for inflation to current dollars.\nLosses from the billion-dollar disasters tracked in this data set have averaged $140 billion per year over the last decade. 2017 was the costliest year, exceeding $300 billion - proportional to about 25 percent of the $1.3 trillion building value put in place that year (Multi-Hazard Mitigation Council, 2019). Since 1980, there have been changes in the frequency and intensity of some weather extremes that can lead to billion-dollar disasters. Drought has become more frequent, lengthening wildfire seasons in the Western states, and extremely heavy rainfall has become more common in the eastern states. Sea level rise can also worsen hurricane storm surge flooding, increasing the cost of a disaster (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. Compounding Disasters in Gulf Coast Communities 2020-2021: Impacts, Findings, and Lessons (2024); Fifth U.S. National Climate Assessment (2023); Multi-Hazard Mitigation Council. Natural Hazard Mitigation Saves (2019)).\nIn 2012, NCEI -- then known as National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) -- reviewed its methodology on how it develops Billion-dollar Disasters. NCEI held a workshop with economic experts (May, 2012) and worked with a consulting partner to examine possible inaccuracy and biases in the data sources and methodology used in developing the loss assessments (mid-2013). This ensures more consistency with the numbers NCEI provides on a yearly basis and give more confidence in the year-to-year comparison of information. Another outcome is a published peer-reviewed article \"U.S. Billion-dollar Weather and Climate Disasters: Data Sources, Trends, Accuracy and Biases\" (Smith and Katz, 2013). This research found the net effect of all biases appears to be an underestimation of average loss. In particular, it is shown that the factor approach can result in an underestimation of average loss of approximately 10\u201315%. This bias was corrected during a reanalysis of the loss data to reflect new loss totals.\nIt is also known that the uncer\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Heat waves can lead to illness and death, particularly among older adults, the very young, and other vulnerable populations (see the Heat-Related Deaths and Heat-Related Illnesses indicators).1 People can also die from exposure to extreme cold (hypothermia). In addition, prolonged exposure to excessive heat and cold can damage crops and injure or kill livestock. Extreme heat can lead to power outages as heavy demands for air conditioning strain the power grid, while extremely cold weather increases the need for heating fuel.\nRecord-setting daily temperatures, heat waves, and cold spells are a natural part of day-to-day variation in weather. As the Earth\u2019s climate warms overall, however, heat waves are expected to become more frequent, longer, and more intense.2,3 Higher heat index values (which combine temperature and humidity to describe perceived temperature) are expected to increase discomfort and aggravate health issues. Conversely, cold spells are expected to decrease. In most locations, scientists expect daily minimum temperatures\u2014which typically occur at night\u2014to become warmer at a faster rate than daily maximum temperatures.4 This change will provide less opportunity to cool off and recover from daytime heat.\nThis indicator examines trends in unusual temperatures from several perspectives:\nThe data come from thousands of weather stations across the United States. National patterns can be determined by dividing the country into a grid and examining the data for one station in each cell of the grid. This method ensures that the results are not biased toward regions that happen to have many stations close together.\nFigure 1 shows the U.S. Annual Heat Wave Index, which tracks the occurrence of heat wave conditions across the contiguous 48 states from 1895 to 2015. While there is no universal definition of a heat wave, this index defines a heat wave as a period lasting at least four days with an average temperature that would only be expected to occur once every 10 years, based on the historical record. The index value for a given year depends on how often heat waves occur and how widespread they are.\nFigures 2 and 3 show trends in the percentage of the country\u2019s area experiencing unusually hot temperatures in the summer and unusually cold temperatures in the winter. These graphs are based on daily maximum temperatures, which usually occur during the day, and daily minimum temperatures, which usually occur at night. At each station, the recorded highs and lows are compared with the full set of historical records. After averaging over a particular month or season of interest, the coldest 10 percent of years are considered \u201cunusually cold\u201d and the warmest 10 percent are \u201cunusually hot.\u201d For example, if last year\u2019s summer highs were the 10th warmest on record for a particular location with more than 100 years of data, that year\u2019s summer highs would be considered unusually warm. Data are available from 1910 to 2015 for summer (June through August) and from 1911 to 2016 for winter (December of the previous year through February).\nFigures 4 and 5 show how trends in unusually hot and cold daily temperatures throughout the year vary by location. These maps cover 1,100 weather stations that have operated since 1948. Figure 4 was created by reviewing all daily maximum temperatures from 1948 to 2015 and identifying the 95th percentile temperature (a temperature that one would only expect to exceed in five days out of every 100) at each station. Next, for each year, the total number of days with maximum temperatures higher than the 95th percentile (that is, unusually hot days) was determined. The map shows how the total number of unusually hot days per year at each station has changed over time. Figure 5 is similar except that it looks at unusually cold days, based on the 5th percentile of daily minimum temperatures.\nMany people are familiar with record daily high and low temperatures, which are frequently mentioned in weather reports. Figure 6 depicts trends in these records by comparing the number of record-setting highs with the number of record-setting lows by decade. These data come from a set of weather stations that have collected data consistently since 1950.\nTemperature data are less certain for the early part of the 20th century because fewer stations were operating at that time. In addition, measuring devices and methods have changed over time, and some stations have moved. The data have been adjusted to the extent possible to account for some of these influences and biases, however, and these uncertainties are not sufficient to change the fundamental trends shown in the figures.\nThe data for this indicator are based on measurements from weather stations managed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Figure 1 uses data from the National Weather Service Cooperative Observer Network. Figures 2 and 3 come from the U.S. Climate Extremes Index, which is based on a smaller group of long-term weather stations that are tracked by the National Centers for Environmental Information and referred to as the U.S. Historical Climatology Network. Figures 4 and 5 use data from a somewhat larger set of stations tracked by the National Centers for Environmental Information, known as the Global Historical Climat\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

An updated edition was eleased on June 11th.\nYou can also watch and share the conversation on X/Twitter, Facebook or LinkedIn.\nKoonin, who\u2019s joining the Hoover Institution this fall as a senior fellow, has a new op-ed out in the Wall Street Journal titled \u201cThe \u2018Climate Crisis\u2019 Fades Out.\u201d\nWe were joined by Roger Pielke Jr., a longtime climate policy analyst you\u2019ve seen here before. Read Roger Pielke Jr.\u2019s critique of Koonin\u2019s book (which largely tracks my views):\nPielke also debated Koonin last year on the question, \u201cIs Net Zero by 2050 Possible?\u201d\nKoonin\u2019s book, which was first published in 2021 and has, according to the publisher, sold some 200,000 copies, grew out of arguments he made in an opinion piece he wrote for The Wall Street Journal in 2014. I reached out to him at that time with a couple of questions and posted them and his answers on my Dot Earth blog.\nThe arguments in \u201cUnsettled\u201d largely sync with the points made a decade ago. Here\u2019s that post, which includes an open letter from a batch of Carnegie Mellon University scientists focused on climate and decisionmaking. Our conversation Tuesday will essentially pick up where we left off here:\nSteven E. Koonin, once the Obama administration\u2019s undersecretary of energy for science and chief scientist at BP, stirred up a swirl of turbulence in global warming discourse this week after The Wall Street Journal published \u201cClimate Science is Not Settled,\u201d his essay calling for more frankness about areas of deep uncertainty in climate science, more research to narrow error ranges and more acknowledgement that society\u2019s decisions on energy and climate policy are based on values as much as data. (The Journal seems to keep this headline on file; here\u2019s a 2009 essay, \u201cClimate Science Isn\u2019t Settled,\u201d by the M.I.T. climatologist Richard Lindzen.)\nPredictably, the piece by Koonin, who became the founding director of New York University\u2019s important Center for Urban Science and Progress in 2012, was quickly hailed by fossil fuel defenders. At the same time, some of Koonin\u2019s central points about the state of climate science were sharply challenged by climate scientists and climate campaigners. I was on the run at the time but sent Koonin a couple of questions, which I also posted on Tumblr.\nHere they are with his answers (with some email shorthand cleaned up), along with a fresh critique of Koonin\u2019s argument by a group of climate science and policy researchers associated with Carnegie Mellon University and a final thought from me:\nQ. Your piece makes the important point that, on vital questions, there\u2019s enduring deep uncertainty behind the \u201c97 Percent of Climate Scientists Agree\u201d headlines and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report summary language. That was the point of my pieces on the many \u201cshapes\u201d of climate knowledge.\nBut I think your piece implies too much that further scientific inquiry can improve the picture. On regional forecasting, extremes (hurricanes), sensitivity to doubled CO2, and other key questions, further science \u2014 if anything \u2014 has clarified that some of these uncertainties aren\u2019t going anywhere.\nA. I agree that regional and extremes are probably hopeless. But I would suppose that equilibrium climate sensitivity [background] and even global mean surface temperature on a decadal scale could be better nailed down by model pruning and better ocean data. An interesting way to test that (which I don\u2019t think has ever been done, but don\u2019t know for sure) is to assume one of the models is the truth, downscale the sampling of the data to what we might reasonably observe in the real world, and see to what extent that can be used to recover the truth. The results would give some indication of the extent to which more observations would help.\nQ. You also imply that you can\u2019t have \u201cgood\u201d climate policy in the face of deep persistent uncertainty. In other endeavors, society has figured this out and some sustained inquiry is going into how to take a least-regrets policy on the greenhouse buildup. See the World Bank paper on \u201cInvestment Decision Making under Deep Uncertainty \u2013 Application to Climate Change.\u201d\nA. This is indeed implied by the tagline [\u201cWe are very far from the knowledge needed to make good climate policy\u201d], which I didn\u2019t write or even see until publication. As I hoped to imply in the last few paragraphs of the article, we can get to good climate policies, but they will depend as much (or even more) upon \u201cvalues\u201d than upon science, given the latter\u2019s uncertainties.\nHere\u2019s the open letter written by nine scientists affiliated with the Center for Climate and Energy Decision Making at Carnegie Mellon:\n~ ~ ~\nUncertainty in Climate Science: Not an Excuse for Inaction\nOn Sunday, more than three hundred thousand people marched in New York City and around the world to urge governments to support an agreement to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that cause climate change. Then, on September 23, the United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon hosted the 2014 UN Climate Summit. There is hope that this meeting will catalyze leadership support for an agreement that enables a pathway to avoid large impacts from climate change.\nWhile the world waited for these events to unfold, on September 20 the Wall Street Journal published an editorial titled \u201cClimate Science is Not Settled.\u201d In this editorial, Steve E. Koonin, Undersecretary for Science in the Department of Energy during President Barack Obama\u2019s first term and current director of the Center for Urban Science and Progress at New York University, argued that while there is agreement that the climate is changing, there is no scientific agreement \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The last year to see a net gain of ice is still 1996.\n\nFull Page Content:\nOver the last forty years, rising temperatures have accelerated ice loss from the ice sheets and glaciers that cover around 10% of the Earth\u2019s land area. Due to extreme warming above the Arctic circle, the Greenland Ice Sheet melting rate has drastically accelerated, which is expected to continue into the future.\n\u2014\nGreenland Ice Sheet: Facts\nThe Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) holds enough water to raise average global sea levels by 7.4 metres. It has been losing mass for the past few decades due to surface meltwater runoff and the loss of water adjacent blocks of ice, termed ice discharge.\nGrIS meltwater runoff has accelerated since the early 2000s, largely due to atmospheric and oceanic warming. The average winter near-surface air temperature rose 2.8\u00b0C over the 100-year period from 1911 to 2012. A recent study observed that discharge increases by 4-5% per mean kilometre of glacier retreat. This means that the more GrIS melts, the quicker its discharge, whose rate is 14% higher today than during 1985-1999.\nGreenland Ice Sheet: Its History\nSince 1978, Arctic sea ice extent has visibly decreased for all months of the year, with a reduction of around 10 to 12% per decade in the month of September (yearly low).\nFigure 2. Comparison of sea ice cover in Greenland between September 1980 and September 2012 (data: Copernicus data hub).\nFrom 2006 to 2015, the Greenland ice sheet lost ice mass at an average rate of around 270 gigatons per year. To put that into perspective:\nAnd in 2019, the GrIS lost a record amount of ice at 532 gigatons, easily surpassing the previous 2012 record of 464 gigatons.\nWhat are the potential impacts of the Greenland Ice Sheet melting?\nSo far we have just considered Greenland\u2019s ice sheet. This, combined with a rapid breakup of West Antarctic ice sheets could result in up to 5m of sea level rise by the end of the century (although this is the worst case scenario imaginable).\nThis would disproportionately affect developing countries, particularly Vietnam, Egypt and the Bahamas. Places like West Africa are already feeling the bite.\nAs a final bombshell, if we ignore ice sheet instability then it is estimated that sea levels will still rise by 1 \u2013 2 m resulting in the forced displacement of up to 630 million people, 70% of which will come from just 8 countries in Asia (for more on this, check out our Sea Level Rise by 2100 series here).\nSource: https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2017/nov/03/three-degree-world-cities-drowned-global-warming.\nArticle written by Steven Vuong and Owen Mulhern.\nYou might also like: Sea Level Rise by 2100 \u2013 Miami\nThe best environmental stories of the week and month, handpicked by our Editor.

These models are huge \u2013 they are made up of more than 1 million lines of computer code representing knowledge from dozens of scientific subfields \u2013 and no individual scientist fully understands all of a model\u2019s inner workings.\nWhat\u2019s more, rather than focusing on just one model, climate scientists develop and compare dozens or more of such models in various climate model intercomparison projects. The opportunity multiplies but so does the complexity. As a philosopher of science, I am fascinated with the way model comparisons help scientists pull real insights out of this tangle of complexity and uncertainty.\nInspired by a recent Eye on the Storm post written by climate modeler Ricky Rood, here I reflect on how models designed for one purpose often end up generating insight in unexpected ways.\nClimate scientists regularly proclaim, citing statistician George Box, that \u201call models are wrong but some are useful.\u201d But what exactly is meant by \u201cwrong?\u201d On the one hand, it could have to do with the idealizations and abstractions included in all scientific models, including climate models:\nSo \u201cAll models are wrong\u201d could just mean that all models include some idealizations or abstractions. And just as Box says, models that employ such idealizations and abstractions can still be advantageous. Indeed, a highly idealized model that leaves out tons of real-world processes will be much easier to understand than a model that tries to capture, say, every gust of wind and every drop of rain.\nOn the other hand, climate models can be wrong in that they give us inaccurate output about past, present, or potential future climates. That is, climate models can give us the wrong answers.\nIt is easiest to see this for cases of past and present climate, where model output can be compared against observations. These comparisons can be done for a huge variety of climate variables involving averages, variability, and trends of observations like temperature, precipitation, pressure, and other climate phenomena of interest.\nA major challenge is that performance analyses of climate models yield a sort of mixed bag: Some models perform better with respect to some variables while others excel elsewhere. For example, if we rank models based on which one does best at simulating global mean surface temperature in the 2010s and which one does best at simulating the rate of Arctic sea ice melt over the past 30 years, different models may well come out on top.\nTo capture this second idea, then, \u201cAll models are wrong\u201d could mean that all models produce at least some inaccurate output. How might such inaccurate models be useful? Here, the story is not so simple.\nOne answer is to emphasize that models are fit for purpose. As Rood put it, models must be \u201cdesigned, built, and evaluated to address a specific application.\u201d If your goal is to teach students about the fundamentals of Earth\u2019s energy balance, then a simple model that you can solve by hand may be most apt. If your goal is to project global mean climate at the end of the century under the assumption of slow-to-no emissions reductions, then a suite of state-of-the-art general circulation models would be more suitable.\nOne challenge in making models \u201cfit for purpose\u201d is that while some priorities are obvious, many of the more fine-grained decisions may not be so clear-cut. For example, while it may seem reasonable to update a model\u2019s cloud representations to better capture cloud feedbacks and thereby improve the model\u2019s ability to simulate temperature changes as a function of carbon dioxide changes, one modeling group that did just this ended up with a model that was less accurate in simulating such temperature changes.\nThey were able to diagnose why the model became less accurate, but only after the fact and only through iterative testing and analysis conducted over several months. More realistic models are often more complex, and more complex models involve more interactions, feedbacks, and emergent behaviors than scientists can track in their heads. So determining which purpose(s) a model will eventually be fit for before the model has been developed and tested is a fairly daunting task. (Not to mention the fact that model builders and model users are often distinct groups of people, and model builders can\u2019t predict how others will use their model down the road.)\nA second challenge is that models that are deemed unfit for some purpose may be co-opted for another (sometimes related) purpose. In such cases, simply judging a model to be \u201cunfit for purpose\u201d would be far too quick. Instead, inaccurate, unfit, or \u201cwrong\u201d models can often be repurposed and ultimately play an essential role in generating new knowledge. Let\u2019s see how this works.\nIn a 2020 study, Katarzyna Tokarska and colleagues produced a model-based estimate of something called transient climate response. Transient climate response, or TCR, is a measure of climate sensitivity that describes how much global temperatures increase when carbon dioxide concentrations reach a doubling after gradually increasing over some time period. The team\u2019s analysis involved looking at model simulations of recent warming and model simulations of potential future warming, using the latest comprehensive suite of models, called CMIP6, developed in support of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\nSome of the CMIP6 models did a relatively poor job of simulating recent warming. Let\u2019s call these the too-hot models. The too-hot models are obviously getting something important wrong and have been rightly critiqued on these grounds. However, scientists don\u2019t want to rely on only a small number of models in case those models turn out to be biased or unrepresentative in ways that aren\u2019t yet understood.
