We look at the Earth from space and we measure it on the ground. And what we see is that the planet's climate is changing. The last years have been the warmest since modern record-keeping began. It's serious. Even a little change in temperature can have big effects. And we're seeing some of those effects now. Sea levels are rising. We're seeing more extreme events like heatwaves and heavy rainfall and wildfire. And we know that a lot of those effects are going to increase with more warming. These changes are impacting decisions that some people make every day, like a farmer thinking about what crops to grow or a homeowner thinking about flood risk. But there's hope. There are scientists at NASA and around the world that are researching this. We know more about our planet than we have ever before, and we learn more every day. So we know why climate is changing. We know that it's due to increasing greenhouse gases from human activity. We also have tools that can help us better understand and better prepare for future climate change. So we develop computer models that help us understand how much it might change in the future. And we're also developing technologies here at NASA and around the world that can help us limit future warming or respond to the warming that we're experiencing. So why does climate change matter? It's real. It's serious, and it's here. We Asked a NASA Scientist. NASA. A NASA 360 Production.",

These mathematical relationships can help to project how a system may respond in the future. Modelers use observational data to understand how different parts of systems interact with each other. They then use this information to project responses under other conditions, including future ones.\nModels help us to understand a variety of systems. They could be as simple as a model of evaporation. When the sun\u2019s energy heats water, that energy is transferred to water molecules and the water evaporates. By studying this process, scientists can observe predictable patterns and translate those patterns into equations that can be used to model this process in other situations. Models start with the initial condition of the system (i.e., the water\u2019s initial temperature), add inputs (i.e., heat), calculate how the inputs and initial condition interact, and produce outputs (i.e., evaporation).\nClimate models \u2015 also called General Circulation Models, Global Climate Models, or GCMs \u2015 are more complex than a model of evaporation, but they follow the same general idea. These models use many different factors such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, heat, and the Earth\u2019s rotation as inputs. Computers then calculate how these factors interact with the ocean, air, and land. Climate models are computer programs that consist of several hundred thousand lines of code. Each model is created by a modeling group, which consists of many scientists and computer programmers. The output of these models is a projection of how the Earth\u2019s climate may change.\nTo better understand what global climate models project, it helps to understand the difference between weather and climate. In general, the west side of the Cascade Range typically experiences a cool, wet winter. This is climate. Climate is usually averaged over a long period of time (e.g., a 30-year period).\nWeather, on the other hand, is what an area experiences on an hourly or daily basis. It is the instantaneous physical state of a location and can include the current temperature, wind, humidity, and precipitation. For example, Portland, Oregon can suddenly get an unexpected spell of warm, dry conditions in January. This may not be what was expected, but it is not outside of the range of possibilities.\nClimate models project the climate, not the weather. They cannot say that on October 24, 2050, it will rain in Seattle. They can say, however, that in 2050, average winter conditions in the Northwest are likely to be warmer than they are in the present day.\nOnce we understand what climate models project, we can look at how they create these projections. Climate models calculate the physical interactions between four components: atmosphere, land, ocean, and sea ice. The calculations are based on several inputs: air temperature, pressure, density, water vapor content, and wind magnitude.\nSome variables and processes, such as snow, rain, and clouds, only exist and/or function in areas smaller than the typical climate model cube (100 km3), and must be simplified, or parameterized. Parameterization includes other mathematical equations that mimic real-world impacts. Parameterization may be used to estimate how much sunlight is reflected or absorbed by clouds, and how much heat is radiated by them, what types of clouds exist in each cube, and when and which type of precipitation forms.\nClimate models have become more advanced over the past several decades. Earlier models calculated physical processes for the atmosphere, land, ocean, and sea ice components separately. As models improved, researchers coupled the ocean and atmosphere components into one model, which more accurately represents Earth\u2019s climate. Earlier models had very coarse resolutions (500 km3, or 119 miles3, about 5 miles on every side of each cube). They showed regional detail, but the resolution was not good enough to provide meaningful local climate information. Improvements in computing power allowed models to be run at higher resolutions, providing greater spatial detail. Despite advances in technology, only very large supercomputers are capable of handling high-resolution climate modeling on a global scale.\nIn order to produce climate projections at more local scales (less than 100 km3), models are \u201cdownscaled.\u201d There are two methods of downscaling: dynamical and statistical. Dynamical downscaling uses the output of global climate models as the input for finer scaled regional climate models that recalculate climate at a finer scale using local features. For example, in the Northwest, regional climate models provide more detail on the topographic complexity of this region, such as the differences in what will happen at the top of Mt. Hood versus at the bottom of Mt. Hood. Statistical downscaling uses statistics to show how large-scale climate patterns affect the local climate. Keep in mind that when models are downscaled, they do not become more \u201caccurate\u201d or better than global climate models, just more detailed.\nModels help us understand how our actions can affect the future climate. They allow modelers to look at different scenarios of increased greenhouse gas emissions and see how those increases may affect the planet. The main outputs of climate models are temperature, humidity of the different layers of the atmosphere, and precipitation (rainfall and snowfall). Models also provide information about the ocean, including temperature, salinity, pH, and extent and cover of ice sheets.\nThe outputs from global climate models are used as inputs into other models to understand what will happen to natural resources. Changes in temperature and precipitation projected by climate models are used by other types of models to calculate the effects on snowpack, crop production, forests \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

They then use this information to project responses under other conditions, including future ones.\nModels help us to understand a variety of systems. They could be as simple as a model of evaporation. When the sun\u2019s energy heats water, that energy is transferred to water molecules and the water evaporates. By studying this process, scientists can observe predictable patterns and translate those patterns into equations that can be used to model this process in other situations. Models start with the initial condition of the system (i.e., the water\u2019s initial temperature), add inputs (i.e., heat), calculate how the inputs and initial condition interact, and produce outputs (i.e., evaporation).\nClimate models \u2015 also called General Circulation Models, Global Climate Models, or GCMs \u2015 are more complex than a model of evaporation, but they follow the same general idea. These models use many different factors such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, heat, and the Earth\u2019s rotation as inputs. Computers then calculate how these factors interact with the ocean, air, and land. Climate models are computer programs that consist of several hundred thousand lines of code. Each model is created by a modeling group, which consists of many scientists and computer programmers. The output of these models is a projection of how the Earth\u2019s climate may change.\nTo better understand what global climate models project, it helps to understand the difference between weather and climate. In general, the west side of the Cascade Range typically experiences a cool, wet winter. This is climate. Climate is usually averaged over a long period of time (e.g., a 30-year period).\nWeather, on the other hand, is what an area experiences on an hourly or daily basis. It is the instantaneous physical state of a location and can include the current temperature, wind, humidity, and precipitation. For example, Portland, Oregon can suddenly get an unexpected spell of warm, dry conditions in January. This may not be what was expected, but it is not outside of the range of possibilities.\nClimate models project the climate, not the weather. They cannot say that on October 24, 2050, it will rain in Seattle. They can say, however, that in 2050, average winter conditions in the Northwest are likely to be warmer than they are in the present day.\nOnce we understand what climate models project, we can look at how they create these projections. Climate models calculate the physical interactions between four components: atmosphere, land, ocean, and sea ice. The calculations are based on several inputs: air temperature, pressure, density, water vapor content, and wind magnitude.\nSome variables and processes, such as snow, rain, and clouds, only exist and/or function in areas smaller than the typical climate model cube (100 km3), and must be simplified, or parameterized. Parameterization includes other mathematical equations that mimic real-world impacts. Parameterization may be used to estimate how much sunlight is reflected or absorbed by clouds, and how much heat is radiated by them, what types of clouds exist in each cube, and when and which type of precipitation forms.\nClimate models have become more advanced over the past several decades. Earlier models calculated physical processes for the atmosphere, land, ocean, and sea ice components separately. As models improved, researchers coupled the ocean and atmosphere components into one model, which more accurately represents Earth\u2019s climate. Earlier models had very coarse resolutions (500 km3, or 119 miles3, about 5 miles on every side of each cube). They showed regional detail, but the resolution was not good enough to provide meaningful local climate information. Improvements in computing power allowed models to be run at higher resolutions, providing greater spatial detail. Despite advances in technology, only very large supercomputers are capable of handling high-resolution climate modeling on a global scale.\nIn order to produce climate projections at more local scales (less than 100 km3), models are \u201cdownscaled.\u201d There are two methods of downscaling: dynamical and statistical. Dynamical downscaling uses the output of global climate models as the input for finer scaled regional climate models that recalculate climate at a finer scale using local features. For example, in the Northwest, regional climate models provide more detail on the topographic complexity of this region, such as the differences in what will happen at the top of Mt. Hood versus at the bottom of Mt. Hood. Statistical downscaling uses statistics to show how large-scale climate patterns affect the local climate. Keep in mind that when models are downscaled, they do not become more \u201caccurate\u201d or better than global climate models, just more detailed.\nModels help us understand how our actions can affect the future climate. They allow modelers to look at different scenarios of increased greenhouse gas emissions and see how those increases may affect the planet. The main outputs of climate models are temperature, humidity of the different layers of the atmosphere, and precipitation (rainfall and snowfall).

Global temperatures last year were around 2.1 degrees Fahrenheit (1.2 degrees Celsius) above the average for NASA\u2019s baseline period (1951-1980), scientists from NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) in New York reported.\n\u201cNASA and NOAA\u2019s global temperature report confirms what billions of people around the world experienced last year; we are facing a climate crisis,\u201d said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. \u201cFrom extreme heat, to wildfires, to rising sea levels, we can see our Earth is changing. There\u2019s still more work to be done, but President Biden and communities across America are taking more action than ever to reduce climate risks and help communities become more resilient \u2013 and NASA will continue to use our vantage point of space to bring critical climate data back down to Earth that is understandable and accessible for all people. NASA and the Biden-Harris Administration are working to protect our home planet and its people, for this generation \u2013 and the next.\u201d\nIn 2023, hundreds of millions of people around the world experienced extreme heat, and each month from June through December set a global record for the respective month. July was the hottest month ever recorded. Overall, Earth was about 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit (or about 1.4 degrees Celsius) warmer in 2023 than the late 19th-century average, when modern record-keeping began.\n\u201cThe exceptional warming that we\u2019re experiencing is not something we\u2019ve seen before in human history,\u201d said Gavin Schmidt, director of GISS. \u201cIt\u2019s driven primarily by our fossil fuel emissions, and we\u2019re seeing the impacts in heat waves, intense rainfall, and coastal flooding.\u201d\nThough scientists have conclusive evidence that the planet\u2019s long-term warming trend is driven by human activity, they still examine other phenomena that can affect yearly or multi-year changes in climate such as El Ni\u00f1o, aerosols and pollution, and volcanic eruptions.\nTypically, the largest source of year-to-year variability is the El Ni\u00f1o \u2013 Southern Oscillation ocean climate pattern in the Pacific Ocean. The pattern has two phases \u2013 El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a \u2013 when sea surface temperatures along the equator switch between warmer, average, and cooler temperatures. From 2020-2022, the Pacific Ocean saw three consecutive La Ni\u00f1a events, which tend to cool global temperatures. In May 2023, the ocean transitioned from La Ni\u00f1a to El Ni\u00f1o, which often coincides with the hottest years on record.\nHowever, the record temperatures in the second half of 2023 occurred before the peak of the current El Ni\u00f1o event. Scientists expect to see the biggest impacts of El Ni\u00f1o in February, March, and April.\nScientists have also investigated possible impacts from the January 2022 eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha\u2019apai undersea volcano, which blasted water vapor and fine particles, or aerosols, into the stratosphere. A recent study found that the volcanic aerosols \u2013 by reflecting sunlight away from Earth\u2019s surface \u2013 led to an overall slight cooling of less than 0.2 degrees Fahrenheit (or about 0.1 degrees Celsius) in the Southern Hemisphere following the eruption.\n\u201cEven with occasional cooling factors like volcanoes or aerosols, we will continue to break records as long as greenhouse gas emissions keep going up,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cAnd, unfortunately, we just set a new record for greenhouse gas emissions again this past year.\u201d\n\u201cThe record-setting year of 2023 underscores the significance of urgent and continued actions to address climate change,\u201d said NASA Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy. \u201cRecent legislation has delivered the U.S. government\u2019s largest-ever climate investment, including billions to strengthen America\u2019s resilience to the increasing impacts of the climate crisis.

They calculate the interactions between the ocean, ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nEstimated reading time: 8 minutes\nScientific models are mathematical relationships or equations that explain how a system (group of interacting or interrelating elements) works. These mathematical relationships can help to project how a system may respond in the future. Modelers use observational data to understand how different parts of systems interact with each other. They then use this information to project responses under other conditions, including future ones.\nModels help us to understand a variety of systems. They could be as simple as a model of evaporation. When the sun\u2019s energy heats water, that energy is transferred to water molecules and the water evaporates. By studying this process, scientists can observe predictable patterns and translate those patterns into equations that can be used to model this process in other situations. Models start with the initial condition of the system (i.e., the water\u2019s initial temperature), add inputs (i.e., heat), calculate how the inputs and initial condition interact, and produce outputs (i.e., evaporation).\nClimate models \u2015 also called General Circulation Models, Global Climate Models, or GCMs \u2015 are more complex than a model of evaporation, but they follow the same general idea. These models use many different factors such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, heat, and the Earth\u2019s rotation as inputs. Computers then calculate how these factors interact with the ocean, air, and land. Climate models are computer programs that consist of several hundred thousand lines of code. Each model is created by a modeling group, which consists of many scientists and computer programmers. The output of these models is a projection of how the Earth\u2019s climate may change.\nTo better understand what global climate models project, it helps to understand the difference between weather and climate. In general, the west side of the Cascade Range typically experiences a cool, wet winter. This is climate. Climate is usually averaged over a long period of time (e.g., a 30-year period).\nWeather, on the other hand, is what an area experiences on an hourly or daily basis. It is the instantaneous physical state of a location and can include the current temperature, wind, humidity, and precipitation. For example, Portland, Oregon can suddenly get an unexpected spell of warm, dry conditions in January. This may not be what was expected, but it is not outside of the range of possibilities.\nClimate models project the climate, not the weather. They cannot say that on October 24, 2050, it will rain in Seattle. They can say, however, that in 2050, average winter conditions in the Northwest are likely to be warmer than they are in the present day.\nOnce we understand what climate models project, we can look at how they create these projections. Climate models calculate the physical interactions between four components: atmosphere, land, ocean, and sea ice. The calculations are based on several inputs: air temperature, pressure, density, water vapor content, and wind magnitude.\nSome variables and processes, such as snow, rain, and clouds, only exist and/or function in areas smaller than the typical climate model cube (100 km3), and must be simplified, or parameterized. Parameterization includes other mathematical equations that mimic real-world impacts. Parameterization may be used to estimate how much sunlight is reflected or absorbed by clouds, and how much heat is radiated by them, what types of clouds exist in each cube, and when and which type of precipitation forms.\nClimate models have become more advanced over the past several decades. Earlier models calculated physical processes for the atmosphere, land, ocean, and sea ice components separately. As models improved, researchers coupled the ocean and atmosphere components into one model, which more accurately represents Earth\u2019s climate. Earlier models had very coarse resolutions (500 km3, or 119 miles3, about 5 miles on every side of each cube). They showed regional detail, but the resolution was not good enough to provide meaningful local climate information. Improvements in computing power allowed models to be run at higher resolutions, providing greater spatial detail. Despite advances in technology, only very large supercomputers are capable of handling high-resolution climate modeling on a global scale.\nIn order to produce climate projections at more local scales (less than 100 km3), models are \u201cdownscaled.\u201d There are two methods of downscaling: dynamical and statistical. Dynamical downscaling uses the output of global climate models as the input for finer scaled regional climate models that recalculate climate at a finer scale using local features. For example, in the Northwest, regional climate models provide more detail on the topographic complexity of this region, such as the differences in what will happen at the top of Mt. Hood versus at the bottom of Mt. Hood. Statistical downscaling uses statistics to show how large-scale climate patterns affect the local climate. Keep in mind that when models are downscaled, they do not become more \u201caccurate\u201d or better than global climate models, just more detailed.\nModels help us understand how our actions can affect the future climate. They allow modelers to look at different scenarios of increased greenhouse gas emissions and see how those increases may affect the planet. The main outputs of climate models are temperature, humidity of the different layers of the atmosphere, and precipitation (rainfall and snowfall). Models also provide information about the ocean, including temperature, salinity, pH, and extent and cover of ice sheets.\nThe outputs from global climate models are used as inputs into other models to understand what will happen to natural resources. Changes in temperature and precipitation projected by climate models are used by other types of models to calculate the effects on snowpack, crop production, forests \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This value is 0.15\u00b0C (0.27\u00b0F) more than the previous record set in 2016. The 10 warmest years in the 174-year record have all occurred during the last decade (2014\u20132023). Of note, the year 2005, which was the first year to set a new global temperature record in the 21st century, is now the 12th-warmest year on record. The year 2010, which had surpassed 2005 at the time, now ranks as the 11th-warmest year on record.\nUnlike the previous two years (2021 and 2022), which were squarely entrenched in a cold phase El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) episode, also known as La Ni\u00f1a, 2023 quickly moved into ENSO neutral territory, transitioning to a warm phase episode, El Ni\u00f1o, by June. ENSO not only affects global weather patterns, but it also affects global temperatures. As seen in the image below, during the warm phase of ENSO (El Ni\u00f1o), global temperatures tend to be warmer than ENSO-neutral or La Ni\u00f1a years, while global temperatures tend to be slightly cooler during cold phase ENSO episodes (La Ni\u00f1a). Despite 2021 and 2022 not ranking among the five warmest years on record, the global annual temperature increased at an average rate of 0.06\u00b0C (0.11\u00b0F) per decade since 1850 and more than three times that rate (0.20\u00b0C / 0.36\u00b0F) since 1982.\nDuring 2023, each monthly global surface temperature anomaly value ranked among the seven warmest with June through December each ranking as the warmest such month on record. The July global temperature value was likely the warmest of all months on record and the July, August, and September temperature anomalies each exceeded 1.0\u00b0C (1.8\u00b0F) above the long-term average for the first time on record. The September anomaly value of 1.44\u00b0C (2.59\u00b0F) was the largest positive monthly global temperature anomaly for any month on record.\nGlobal ocean temperatures in 2023 were also noteworthly with nine-consecutive months (April\u2013December) of record warm temperatures. The September ocean temperature anomaly value (+1.04\u00b0C/+1.87\u00b0F) was warmest of any month on record.\nThe Northern Hemisphere summer season (June\u2013August) was warmest on record and the Northern Hemisphere autumn (September\u2013November) was not only the warmest such period on record, it exceeded the previous record from 2015 by 0.39\u00b0C (0.70\u00b0F) and was the largest positive seasonal anomaly for any season on record in the Northern Hemisphere. The 2023 Northern Hemisphere surface temperature was also warmest on record at +1.54\u00b0C (+2.77\u00b0F). Meanwhile, the Southern Hemisphere had its warmest year on record, with a temperature that was 0.82\u00b0C (1.48\u00b0F) above the 20th century average.\nThe 1901\u20132000 average combined land and ocean annual temperature is 13.9\u00b0C (57.0\u00b0F), the annually averaged land temperature for the same period is 8.5\u00b0C (47.3\u00b0F), and the long-term annually averaged sea surface temperature is 16.1\u00b0C (60.9\u00b0F).\nThe following table lists the global combined land and ocean annually averaged temperature rank and anomaly for each of the 10 warmest years on record.\nThe year was characterized by near-record warm temperatures across much of the globe, with record-high annual temperatures across parts of Canada, the southern U.S., Central America, South America, Africa, Europe, Asia, and a large portion of the central and north-eastern Atlantic as well as portions of the South Atlantic, Indian and South Pacific oceans. Meanwhile, cooler-than-average temperatures were limited to portions of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean.\nNorth America's annual temperature was 2.01\u00b0C (3.62\u00b0F) above the 1910-2000 average and was the warmest year on record. Temperatures across North America varied somewhat throughout the year. Ten of the 12 months had an above-average monthly temperature. The months of May, August, September, and December were warmest on record with July, October, and November ranking as second warmest for their respective months. August 2023 was North America's warmest month of the year with a temperature departure of +1.94\u00b0C (+3.49\u00b0F), while the largest positive temperature anomaly occurred in December (+4.88\u00b0C/8.78\u00b0F) surpassing the previous record set in 1939 by a margin of 1.39\u00b0C (2.50\u00b0F). February was North America's coldest month of the year at +0.61\u00b0C (+1.09\u00b0F). North America's yearly temperature has increased at an average rate of 0.14\u00b0C (0.23\u00b0F) per decade since 1910; however, the average rate of increase is more than double the rate (0.34\u00b0C/0.61\u00b0F) since 1982.\nSouth America's annual temperature was 1.73\u00b0C (3.11\u00b0F) above average \u2014 the warmest year since regional records began in 1910. This was South America's 47th consecutive year with temperatures above average. Nine of South America's 10 warmest years have occurred since 2012. South America's annual temperature has increased at an average rate of 0.15\u00b0C (0.27\u00b0F) per decade since 1910; however, the average rate of increase is nearly double (0.25\u00b0C/0.45\u00b0F) that value since 1982.\nSouth America had monthly temperatures that were above-average to record warm every month during 2023. Seven months (May and July through December) were record warm with each month from August to December having records that exceeded the previous record by a substantial margin (ranging from +0.32\u00b0C to +0.59\u00b0C higher than the previous record value). The month of August had the highest temperature departure of the year at +2.43\u00b0C (+4.37\u00b0F); meanwhile, January had the smallest temperature departure for the year at +0.84\u00b0C (+1.51\u00b0F).\nEurope had above-average monthly temperatures throughout the year, with the highest monthly temperature departure of +3.50\u00b0C (+6.30\u00b0F) occurring in January, resulting in the warmest January on record. In addition to January, September also ranked as the warmest such month on record surpassing the previous record set in 2020 by a margin of 1.02\u00b0C (1.84\u00b0F).

Global temperatures last year were around 2.1 degrees Fahrenheit (1.2 degrees Celsius) above the average for NASA\u2019s baseline period (1951-1980), scientists from NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) in New York reported.\n\u201cNASA and NOAA\u2019s global temperature report confirms what billions of people around the world experienced last year; we are facing a climate crisis,\u201d said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. \u201cFrom extreme heat, to wildfires, to rising sea levels, we can see our Earth is changing. There\u2019s still more work to be done, but President Biden and communities across America are taking more action than ever to reduce climate risks and help communities become more resilient \u2013 and NASA will continue to use our vantage point of space to bring critical climate data back down to Earth that is understandable and accessible for all people. NASA and the Biden-Harris Administration are working to protect our home planet and its people, for this generation \u2013 and the next.\u201d\nIn 2023, hundreds of millions of people around the world experienced extreme heat, and each month from June through December set a global record for the respective month. July was the hottest month ever recorded. Overall, Earth was about 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit (or about 1.4 degrees Celsius) warmer in 2023 than the late 19th-century average, when modern record-keeping began.\n\u201cThe exceptional warming that we\u2019re experiencing is not something we\u2019ve seen before in human history,\u201d said Gavin Schmidt, director of GISS. \u201cIt\u2019s driven primarily by our fossil fuel emissions, and we\u2019re seeing the impacts in heat waves, intense rainfall, and coastal flooding.\u201d\nThough scientists have conclusive evidence that the planet\u2019s long-term warming trend is driven by human activity, they still examine other phenomena that can affect yearly or multi-year changes in climate such as El Ni\u00f1o, aerosols and pollution, and volcanic eruptions.\nTypically, the largest source of year-to-year variability is the El Ni\u00f1o \u2013 Southern Oscillation ocean climate pattern in the Pacific Ocean. The pattern has two phases \u2013 El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a \u2013 when sea surface temperatures along the equator switch between warmer, average, and cooler temperatures. From 2020-2022, the Pacific Ocean saw three consecutive La Ni\u00f1a events, which tend to cool global temperatures. In May 2023, the ocean transitioned from La Ni\u00f1a to El Ni\u00f1o, which often coincides with the hottest years on record.\nHowever, the record temperatures in the second half of 2023 occurred before the peak of the current El Ni\u00f1o event.

The year 2010, which had surpassed 2005 at the time, now ranks as the 11th-warmest year on record.\nUnlike the previous two years (2021 and 2022), which were squarely entrenched in a cold phase El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) episode, also known as La Ni\u00f1a, 2023 quickly moved into ENSO neutral territory, transitioning to a warm phase episode, El Ni\u00f1o, by June. ENSO not only affects global weather patterns, but it also affects global temperatures. As seen in the image below, during the warm phase of ENSO (El Ni\u00f1o), global temperatures tend to be warmer than ENSO-neutral or La Ni\u00f1a years, while global temperatures tend to be slightly cooler during cold phase ENSO episodes (La Ni\u00f1a). Despite 2021 and 2022 not ranking among the five warmest years on record, the global annual temperature increased at an average rate of 0.06\u00b0C (0.11\u00b0F) per decade since 1850 and more than three times that rate (0.20\u00b0C / 0.36\u00b0F) since 1982.\nDuring 2023, each monthly global surface temperature anomaly value ranked among the seven warmest with June through December each ranking as the warmest such month on record. The July global temperature value was likely the warmest of all months on record and the July, August, and September temperature anomalies each exceeded 1.0\u00b0C (1.8\u00b0F) above the long-term average for the first time on record. The September anomaly value of 1.44\u00b0C (2.59\u00b0F) was the largest positive monthly global temperature anomaly for any month on record.\nGlobal ocean temperatures in 2023 were also noteworthly with nine-consecutive months (April\u2013December) of record warm temperatures. The September ocean temperature anomaly value (+1.04\u00b0C/+1.87\u00b0F) was warmest of any month on record.\nThe Northern Hemisphere summer season (June\u2013August) was warmest on record and the Northern Hemisphere autumn (September\u2013November) was not only the warmest such period on record, it exceeded the previous record from 2015 by 0.39\u00b0C (0.70\u00b0F) and was the largest positive seasonal anomaly for any season on record in the Northern Hemisphere. The 2023 Northern Hemisphere surface temperature was also warmest on record at +1.54\u00b0C (+2.77\u00b0F). Meanwhile, the Southern Hemisphere had its warmest year on record, with a temperature that was 0.82\u00b0C (1.48\u00b0F) above the 20th century average.\nThe 1901\u20132000 average combined land and ocean annual temperature is 13.9\u00b0C (57.0\u00b0F), the annually averaged land temperature for the same period is 8.5\u00b0C (47.3\u00b0F), and the long-term annually averaged sea surface temperature is 16.1\u00b0C (60.9\u00b0F).\nThe following table lists the global combined land and ocean annually averaged temperature rank and anomaly for each of the 10 warmest years on record.\nThe year was characterized by near-record warm temperatures across much of the globe, with record-high annual temperatures across parts of Canada, the southern U.S., Central America, South America, Africa, Europe, Asia, and a large portion of the central and north-eastern Atlantic as well as portions of the South Atlantic, Indian and South Pacific oceans. Meanwhile, cooler-than-average temperatures were limited to portions of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean.\nNorth America's annual temperature was 2.01\u00b0C (3.62\u00b0F) above the 1910-2000 average and was the warmest year on record. Temperatures across North America varied somewhat throughout the year. Ten of the 12 months had an above-average monthly temperature. The months of May, August, September, and December were warmest on record with July, October, and November ranking as second warmest for their respective months. August 2023 was North America's warmest month of the year with a temperature departure of +1.94\u00b0C (+3.49\u00b0F), while the largest positive temperature anomaly occurred in December (+4.88\u00b0C/8.78\u00b0F) surpassing the previous record set in 1939 by a margin of 1.39\u00b0C (2.50\u00b0F). February was North America's coldest month of the year at +0.61\u00b0C (+1.09\u00b0F). North America's yearly temperature has increased at an average rate of 0.14\u00b0C (0.23\u00b0F) per decade since 1910; however, the average rate of increase is more than double the rate (0.34\u00b0C/0.61\u00b0F) since 1982.\nSouth America's annual temperature was 1.73\u00b0C (3.11\u00b0F) above average \u2014 the warmest year since regional records began in 1910. This was South America's 47th consecutive year with temperatures above average. Nine of South America's 10 warmest years have occurred since 2012. South America's annual temperature has increased at an average rate of 0.15\u00b0C (0.27\u00b0F) per decade since 1910; however, the average rate of increase is nearly double (0.25\u00b0C/0.45\u00b0F) that value since 1982.\nSouth America had monthly temperatures that were above-average to record warm every month during 2023. Seven months (May and July through December) were record warm with each month from August to December having records that exceeded the previous record by a substantial margin (ranging from +0.32\u00b0C to +0.59\u00b0C higher than the previous record value). The month of August had the highest temperature departure of the year at +2.43\u00b0C (+4.37\u00b0F); meanwhile, January had the smallest temperature departure for the year at +0.84\u00b0C (+1.51\u00b0F).\nEurope had above-average monthly temperatures throughout the year, with the highest monthly temperature departure of +3.50\u00b0C (+6.30\u00b0F) occurring in January, resulting in the warmest January on record. In addition to January, September also ranked as the warmest such month on record surpassing the previous record set in 2020 by a margin of 1.02\u00b0C (1.84\u00b0F).

While natural variability plays some part, the preponderance of evidence indicates that human activities\u2014particularly emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases\u2014are mostly responsible for making our planet warmer.\nAccording to an ongoing temperature analysis led by scientists at NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), the average global temperature on Earth has increased by at least 1.1\u00b0 Celsius (1.9\u00b0 Fahrenheit) since 1880. The majority of the warming has occurred since 1975, at a rate of roughly 0.15 to 0.20\u00b0C per decade.\nThe maps above show temperature anomalies in five-year increments since 1880. (Click on the arrow to run the animation.) These are not absolute temperatures, but changes from the norm for each area. The data reflect how much warmer or cooler each region was compared to a base period of 1951-1980. (The global mean surface air temperature for that period was 14\u00b0C (57\u00b0F), with an uncertainty of several tenths of a degree.)\nThe image below shows global temperature anomalies in 2022, which tied for the fifth warmest year on record. The past nine years have been the warmest years since modern recordkeeping began in 1880.\nAs the maps show, global warming does not mean temperatures rise everywhere at every time by same rate. Temperatures might rise 5 degrees in one region and drop 2 degrees in another. For instance, exceptionally cold winters in one place might be balanced by extremely warm winters in another part of the world. Generally, warming is greater over land than over the oceans because water is slower to absorb and release heat (thermal inertia). Warming may also differ substantially within specific land masses and ocean basins.\nIn the animation at the top of the page and in the bar chart below, the years from 1880 to 1939 tend to be cooler, then level off by the 1950s. Decades within the base period (1951-1980) do not appear particularly warm or cold because they are the standard against which other years are measured.\nThe leveling off of temperatures in the middle of the 20th century can be explained by natural variability and by the cooling effects of aerosols generated by factories, power plants, and motor vehicles in the years of rapid economic growth after World War II. Fossil fuel use also increased after the war (5 percent per year), boosting greenhouse gases. Cooling from aerosol pollution happened rapidly. In contrast, greenhouse gases accumulated slowly, but they remain in the atmosphere for a much longer time. According to former GISS director James Hansen, the strong warming trend of the past four decades likely reflects a shift from balanced aerosol and greenhouse gas effects on the atmosphere to a predominance of greenhouse gas effects after aerosols were curbed by pollution controls.\nWhy should we care about one or two degrees of global warming? After all, temperatures fluctuate by many degrees every day where we live.\nThe temperatures we experience locally and in short periods can fluctuate significantly due to predictable, cyclical events (night and day, summer and winter) and hard-to-predict wind and precipitation patterns. But the global temperature mainly depends on how much energy the planet receives from the Sun and how much it radiates back into space. The energy coming from the Sun fluctuates very little by year, while the amount of energy radiated by Earth is closely tied to the chemical composition of the atmosphere\u2014particularly the amount of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.\nA one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all of the oceans, the atmosphere, and the land masses by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age. A five-degree drop was enough to bury a large part of North America under a towering mass of ice 20,000 years ago.\nGlobal temperature records start around 1880 because observations did not sufficiently cover enough of the planet prior to that time. The line plot above shows yearly temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2020 as recorded by NASA, NOAA, the Berkeley Earth research group, the Met Office Hadley Centre (United Kingdom), and the Cowtan and Way analysis. Though there are minor variations from year to year, all five records show peaks and valleys in sync with each other. All show rapid warming in the past few decades, and all show the last decade as the warmest.\nThe NASA GISS team chose the period of 1951-1980 as its baseline largely because the U.S. National Weather Service uses a three-decade period to define \u201cnormal\u201d or average temperature. The GISS temperature analysis effort also began around 1980, so the most recent 30 years was 1951-1980. Their objective is to provide an estimate of temperature change that could be compared with predictions of global climate change in response to atmospheric carbon dioxide, aerosols, and changes in solar activity.\nNASA\u2019s temperature analyses incorporate surface temperature measurements from more than 20,000 weather stations, ship- and buoy-based observations of sea surface temperatures, and temperature measurements from Antarctic research stations. These in situ measurements are analyzed using an algorithm that considers the varied spacing of temperature stations around the globe and urban heat island effects.\nSubscribe to the Earth Observatory and get the Earth in your inbox.\nNASA's Earth Observatory brings you the Earth, every day, with in-depth stories and stunning imagery.\nExplore Earth Science\nEarth Science Data\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

As the maps show, global warming does not mean temperatures rise ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAir temperatures on Earth have been rising since the Industrial Revolution. While natural variability plays some part, the preponderance of evidence indicates that human activities\u2014particularly emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases\u2014are mostly responsible for making our planet warmer.\nAccording to an ongoing temperature analysis led by scientists at NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), the average global temperature on Earth has increased by at least 1.1\u00b0 Celsius (1.9\u00b0 Fahrenheit) since 1880. The majority of the warming has occurred since 1975, at a rate of roughly 0.15 to 0.20\u00b0C per decade.\nThe maps above show temperature anomalies in five-year increments since 1880. (Click on the arrow to run the animation.) These are not absolute temperatures, but changes from the norm for each area. The data reflect how much warmer or cooler each region was compared to a base period of 1951-1980. (The global mean surface air temperature for that period was 14\u00b0C (57\u00b0F), with an uncertainty of several tenths of a degree.)\nThe image below shows global temperature anomalies in 2022, which tied for the fifth warmest year on record. The past nine years have been the warmest years since modern recordkeeping began in 1880.\nAs the maps show, global warming does not mean temperatures rise everywhere at every time by same rate. Temperatures might rise 5 degrees in one region and drop 2 degrees in another. For instance, exceptionally cold winters in one place might be balanced by extremely warm winters in another part of the world. Generally, warming is greater over land than over the oceans because water is slower to absorb and release heat (thermal inertia). Warming may also differ substantially within specific land masses and ocean basins.\nIn the animation at the top of the page and in the bar chart below, the years from 1880 to 1939 tend to be cooler, then level off by the 1950s. Decades within the base period (1951-1980) do not appear particularly warm or cold because they are the standard against which other years are measured.\nThe leveling off of temperatures in the middle of the 20th century can be explained by natural variability and by the cooling effects of aerosols generated by factories, power plants, and motor vehicles in the years of rapid economic growth after World War II. Fossil fuel use also increased after the war (5 percent per year), boosting greenhouse gases. Cooling from aerosol pollution happened rapidly. In contrast, greenhouse gases accumulated slowly, but they remain in the atmosphere for a much longer time. According to former GISS director James Hansen, the strong warming trend of the past four decades likely reflects a shift from balanced aerosol and greenhouse gas effects on the atmosphere to a predominance of greenhouse gas effects after aerosols were curbed by pollution controls.\nWhy should we care about one or two degrees of global warming? After all, temperatures fluctuate by many degrees every day where we live.\nThe temperatures we experience locally and in short periods can fluctuate significantly due to predictable, cyclical events (night and day, summer and winter) and hard-to-predict wind and precipitation patterns. But the global temperature mainly depends on how much energy the planet receives from the Sun and how much it radiates back into space. The energy coming from the Sun fluctuates very little by year, while the amount of energy radiated by Earth is closely tied to the chemical composition of the atmosphere\u2014particularly the amount of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.\nA one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all of the oceans, the atmosphere, and the land masses by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age. A five-degree drop was enough to bury a large part of North America under a towering mass of ice 20,000 years ago.\nGlobal temperature records start around 1880 because observations did not sufficiently cover enough of the planet prior to that time. The line plot above shows yearly temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2020 as recorded by NASA, NOAA, the Berkeley Earth research group, the Met Office Hadley Centre (United Kingdom), and the Cowtan and Way analysis. Though there are minor variations from year to year, all five records show peaks and valleys in sync with each other. All show rapid warming in the past few decades, and all show the last decade as the warmest.\nThe NASA GISS team chose the period of 1951-1980 as its baseline largely because the U.S. National Weather Service uses a three-decade period to define \u201cnormal\u201d or average temperature. The GISS temperature analysis effort also began around 1980, so the most recent 30 years was 1951-1980. Their objective is to provide an estimate of temperature change that could be compared with predictions of global climate change in response to atmospheric carbon dioxide, aerosols, and changes in solar activity.\nNASA\u2019s temperature analyses incorporate surface temperature measurements from more than 20,000 weather stations, ship- and buoy-based observations of sea surface temperatures, and temperature measurements from Antarctic research stations. These in situ measurements are analyzed using an algorithm that considers the varied spacing of temperature stations around the globe and urban heat island effects.\nSubscribe to the Earth Observatory and get the Earth in your inbox.\nNASA's Earth Observatory brings you the Earth, every day, with in-depth stories and stunning imagery.\nExplore Earth Science\nEarth Science Data\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Virtually all climate scientists agree that this increase in heat-trapping gases is the main reason for the 1.8\u00b0F (1.0\u00b0C) rise in global average temperature since the late nineteenth century. Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, and various chlorofluorocarbons are all human-emitted heat-trapping gases. Among these, carbon dioxide is of greatest concern to scientists because it exerts a larger overall warming influence than the other gases combined.\nSteam billows from the Intermountain Power Plant in Delta, Utah.

Of this human-produced carbon, forests and other vegetation absorb around 3.2 billion metric tons per year, while the ocean absorbs about 2.5 billion metric tons per year. A net 5 billion metric tons of human-produced carbon remain in the atmosphere each year, raising the global average carbon dioxide concentrations by about 2.3 parts per million per year.

(Click on the arrow to run the animation.) These are not absolute temperatures, but changes from the norm for each area. The data reflect how much warmer or cooler each region was compared to a base period of 1951-1980. (The global mean surface air temperature for that period was 14\u00b0C (57\u00b0F), with an uncertainty of several tenths of a degree.)\nThe image below shows global temperature anomalies in 2022, which tied for the fifth warmest year on record. The past nine years have been the warmest years since modern recordkeeping began in 1880.\nAs the maps show, global warming does not mean temperatures rise everywhere at every time by same rate. Temperatures might rise 5 degrees in one region and drop 2 degrees in another. For instance, exceptionally cold winters in one place might be balanced by extremely warm winters in another part of the world. Generally, warming is greater over land than over the oceans because water is slower to absorb and release heat (thermal inertia). Warming may also differ substantially within specific land masses and ocean basins.\nIn the animation at the top of the page and in the bar chart below, the years from 1880 to 1939 tend to be cooler, then level off by the 1950s. Decades within the base period (1951-1980) do not appear particularly warm or cold because they are the standard against which other years are measured.\nThe leveling off of temperatures in the middle of the 20th century can be explained by natural variability and by the cooling effects of aerosols generated by factories, power plants, and motor vehicles in the years of rapid economic growth after World War II. Fossil fuel use also increased after the war (5 percent per year), boosting greenhouse gases. Cooling from aerosol pollution happened rapidly. In contrast, greenhouse gases accumulated slowly, but they remain in the atmosphere for a much longer time. According to former GISS director James Hansen, the strong warming trend of the past four decades likely reflects a shift from balanced aerosol and greenhouse gas effects on the atmosphere to a predominance of greenhouse gas effects after aerosols were curbed by pollution controls.\nWhy should we care about one or two degrees of global warming? After all, temperatures fluctuate by many degrees every day where we live.\nThe temperatures we experience locally and in short periods can fluctuate significantly due to predictable, cyclical events (night and day, summer and winter) and hard-to-predict wind and precipitation patterns. But the global temperature mainly depends on how much energy the planet receives from the Sun and how much it radiates back into space. The energy coming from the Sun fluctuates very little by year, while the amount of energy radiated by Earth is closely tied to the chemical composition of the atmosphere\u2014particularly the amount of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.\nA one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all of the oceans, the atmosphere, and the land masses by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age. A five-degree drop was enough to bury a large part of North America under a towering mass of ice 20,000 years ago.\nGlobal temperature records start around 1880 because observations did not sufficiently cover enough of the planet prior to that time. The line plot above shows yearly temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2020 as recorded by NASA, NOAA, the Berkeley Earth research group, the Met Office Hadley Centre (United Kingdom), and the Cowtan and Way analysis. Though there are minor variations from year to year, all five records show peaks and valleys in sync with each other. All show rapid warming in the past few decades, and all show the last decade as the warmest.\nThe NASA GISS team chose the period of 1951-1980 as its baseline largely because the U.S. National Weather Service uses a three-decade period to define \u201cnormal\u201d or average temperature. The GISS temperature analysis effort also began around 1980, so the most recent 30 years was 1951-1980. Their objective is to provide an estimate of temperature change that could be compared with predictions of global climate change in response to atmospheric carbon dioxide, aerosols, and changes in solar activity.\nNASA\u2019s temperature analyses incorporate surface temperature measurements from more than 20,000 weather stations, ship- and buoy-based observations of sea surface temperatures, and temperature measurements from Antarctic research stations. These in situ measurements are analyzed using an algorithm that considers the varied spacing of temperature stations around the globe and urban heat island effects.\nSubscribe to the Earth Observatory and get the Earth in your inbox.\nNASA's Earth Observatory brings you the Earth, every day, with in-depth stories and stunning imagery.\nExplore Earth Science\nEarth Science Data\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Human activities are responsible for almost all of the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere over the last 150 years.1 The largest source of greenhouse gas emissions from human activities in the United States is from burning fossil fuels for electricity, heat, and transportation.\nEPA tracks total U.S. emissions by publishing the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks. This annual report estimates the total national greenhouse gas emissions and removals associated with human activities across the United States by source, gas, and economic sector.\nTotal emissions in 2022 are 6,343.2 Million Metric Tons of CO\u2082 equivalent. Percentages may not add up to 100% due to independent rounding. Greenhouse gas emissions from the commercial, residential, and industrial sectors increase substantially when indirect emissions from electricity end-use are included, due to the relatively large share of electricity use by buildings (e.g., heating, ventilation, and air conditioning; lighting; appliances and plug load) and use of electricity for powering industrial machinery. More information is also in the electricity end-use emissions section of the Electric Power sector page.\nLand Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry in the United States is a net sink and offsets 13% of these greenhouse gas emissions. This net sink is not shown in the above diagrams. All emission estimates are sourced from the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990\u20132022.\nWhat are the primary sources of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and sinks in each economic sector?\nElectric Power Transportation Industry Commercial/Residential\nAgriculture Land Use/Forestry\nA million metric tons equals about 2.2 billion pounds, or 1 trillion grams. For comparison, a small car is likely to weigh a little more than 1 metric ton. Thus, a million metric tons are roughly the same mass as 1 million small cars.\nThe U.S. GHG Inventory uses metric units for consistency and comparability with other countries. For reference, a metric ton is slightly more (approximately 10%) than a U.S. \"short\" ton.\nGreenhouse gas emissions are often measured in carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent. To convert emissions of a gas into CO2 equivalent, its emissions are multiplied by the gas's Global Warming Potential (GWP). The GWP takes into account the fact that many gases are more effective at warming Earth than CO2, per unit mass.\nThe GWP values appearing in the Overview of Greenhouse Gases and Sources of Greenhouse Gas web pages reflect the values used in the U.S. GHG Inventory, which are drawn from the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). For further discussion of GWPs and an estimate of greenhouse gas emissions using updated GWPs, see Annex 6 of the U.S. GHG Inventory and the IPCC's discussion on GWPs (pdf)Exit EPA\u2019s website (106 pp, 7.7MB).\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Some of the incoming sunlight is reflected directly back into space, especially by bright surfaces such as ice and clouds, and the rest is absorbed by the surface and the atmosphere. Much of this absorbed solar energy is re-emitted as heat (longwave or infrared radiation). The atmosphere in turn absorbs and re-radiates heat, some of which escapes to space. Any disturbance to this balance of incoming and outgoing energy will affect the climate. For example, small changes in the output of energy from the Sun will affect this balance directly.\nIf all heat energy emitted from the surface passed through the atmosphere directly into space, Earth\u2019s average surface temperature would be tens of degrees colder than today. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, including water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, act to make the surface much warmer than this because they absorb and emit heat energy in all directions (including downwards), keeping Earth\u2019s surface and lower atmosphere warm [Figure B1]. Without this greenhouse effect, life as we know it could not have evolved on our planet. Adding more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere makes it even more effective at preventing heat from escaping into space. When the energy leaving is less than the energy entering, Earth warms until a new balance is established.\nGreenhouse gases emitted by human activities alter Earth\u2019s energy balance and thus its climate. Humans also affect climate by changing the nature of the land surfaces (for example by clearing forests for farming) and through the emission of pollutants that affect the amount and type of particles in the atmosphere.\nScientists have determined that, when all human and natural factors are considered, Earth\u2019s climate balance has been altered towards warming, with the biggest contributor being increases in CO2.\nFigure b1. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, including water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, absorb heat energy and emit it in all directions (including downwards), keeping Earth\u2019s surface and lower atmosphere warm. Adding more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere enhances the effect, making Earth\u2019s surface and lower atmosphere even warmer. Image based on a figure from US EPA.\nThe atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide have increased significantly since the Industrial Revolution began. In the case of carbon dioxide, the average concentration measured at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii has risen from 316 parts per million (ppm) in 1959 (the first full year of data available) to more than 411 ppm in 2019 [Figure B2]. The same rates of increase have since been recorded at numerous other stations worldwide. Since preindustrial times, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 has increased by over 40%, methane has increased by more than 150%, and nitrous oxide has increased by roughly 20%. More than half of the increase in CO2 has occurred since 1970. Increases in all three gases contribute to warming of Earth, with the increase in CO2 playing the largest role. See page B3 to learn about the sources of human emitted greenhouse gases. Learn about the sources of human emitted greenhouse gases.\nScientists have examined greenhouse gases in the context of the past. Analysis of air trapped inside ice that has been accumulating over time in Antarctica shows that the CO2 concentration began to increase significantly in the 19th century [Figure B3], after staying in the range of 260 to 280 ppm for the previous 10,000 years. Ice core records extending back 800,000 years show that during that time, CO2 concentrations remained within the range of 170 to 300 ppm throughout many \u201cice age\u201d cycles - learn about the ice ages - and no concentration above 300 ppm is seen in ice core records until the past 200 years.\nMeasurements of the forms (isotopes) of carbon in the modern atmosphere show a clear fingerprint of the addition of \u201cold\u201d carbon (depleted in natural radioactive 14C) coming from the combustion of fossil fuels (as opposed to \u201cnewer\u201d carbon coming from living systems). In addition, it is known that human activities (excluding land use changes) currently emit an estimated 10 billion tonnes of carbon each year, mostly by burning fossil fuels, which is more than enough to explain the observed increase in concentration. These and other lines of evidence point conclusively to the fact that the elevated CO2 concentration in our atmosphere is the result of human activities.\nFig b2. Measurements of atmospheric CO2 since 1958 from the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii (black) and from the South Pole (red) show a steady annual increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration. The measurements are made at remote places like these because they are not greatly influenced by local processes, so therefore they are representative of the background atmosphere. The small up-and-down saw-tooth pattern reflects seasonal changes in the release and uptake of CO2 by plants. Source: Scripps CO2 Program\nFigure b3. CO2 variations during the past 1,000 years, obtained from analysis of air trapped in an ice core extracted from Antarctica (red squares), show a sharp rise in atmospheric CO2 starting in the late 19th century. Modern atmospheric measurements from Mauna Loa are superimposed in gray. Source: figure by Eric Wolff, data from Etheridge et al., 1996; MacFarling Meure et al., 2006; Scripps CO2 Program.\nEstimating global average surface air temperature increase requires careful analysis of millions of measurements from around the world, including from land stations, ships, and satellites. Despite the many complications of synthesising such data, multiple independent teams have concluded separately and unanimously that global average surface air temperature has risen by about 1 \u00b0C (1.8 \u00b0F) since 1900 [Figure B4].

While natural variability plays some part, the preponderance of evidence indicates that human activities\u2014particularly emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases\u2014are mostly responsible for making our planet warmer.\nAccording to an ongoing temperature analysis led by scientists at NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), the average global temperature on Earth has increased by at least 1.1\u00b0 Celsius (1.9\u00b0 Fahrenheit) since 1880. The majority of the warming has occurred since 1975, at a rate of roughly 0.15 to 0.20\u00b0C per decade.\nThe maps above show temperature anomalies in five-year increments since 1880. (Click on the arrow to run the animation.) These are not absolute temperatures, but changes from the norm for each area. The data reflect how much warmer or cooler each region was compared to a base period of 1951-1980. (The global mean surface air temperature for that period was 14\u00b0C (57\u00b0F), with an uncertainty of several tenths of a degree.)\nThe image below shows global temperature anomalies in 2022, which tied for the fifth warmest year on record. The past nine years have been the warmest years since modern recordkeeping began in 1880.\nAs the maps show, global warming does not mean temperatures rise everywhere at every time by same rate. Temperatures might rise 5 degrees in one region and drop 2 degrees in another. For instance, exceptionally cold winters in one place might be balanced by extremely warm winters in another part of the world. Generally, warming is greater over land than over the oceans because water is slower to absorb and release heat (thermal inertia). Warming may also differ substantially within specific land masses and ocean basins.\nIn the animation at the top of the page and in the bar chart below, the years from 1880 to 1939 tend to be cooler, then level off by the 1950s. Decades within the base period (1951-1980) do not appear particularly warm or cold because they are the standard against which other years are measured.\nThe leveling off of temperatures in the middle of the 20th century can be explained by natural variability and by the cooling effects of aerosols generated by factories, power plants, and motor vehicles in the years of rapid economic growth after World War II. Fossil fuel use also increased after the war (5 percent per year), boosting greenhouse gases. Cooling from aerosol pollution happened rapidly. In contrast, greenhouse gases accumulated slowly, but they remain in the atmosphere for a much longer time. According to former GISS director James Hansen, the strong warming trend of the past four decades likely reflects a shift from balanced aerosol and greenhouse gas effects on the atmosphere to a predominance of greenhouse gas effects after aerosols were curbed by pollution controls.\nWhy should we care about one or two degrees of global warming? After all, temperatures fluctuate by many degrees every day where we live.\nThe temperatures we experience locally and in short periods can fluctuate significantly due to predictable, cyclical events (night and day, summer and winter) and hard-to-predict wind and precipitation patterns. But the global temperature mainly depends on how much energy the planet receives from the Sun and how much it radiates back into space. The energy coming from the Sun fluctuates very little by year, while the amount of energy radiated by Earth is closely tied to the chemical composition of the atmosphere\u2014particularly the amount of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.\nA one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all of the oceans, the atmosphere, and the land masses by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age. A five-degree drop was enough to bury a large part of North America under a towering mass of ice 20,000 years ago.\nGlobal temperature records start around 1880 because observations did not sufficiently cover enough of the planet prior to that time. The line plot above shows yearly temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2020 as recorded by NASA, NOAA, the Berkeley Earth research group, the Met Office Hadley Centre (United Kingdom), and the Cowtan and Way analysis. Though there are minor variations from year to year, all five records show peaks and valleys in sync with each other. All show rapid warming in the past few decades, and all show the last decade as the warmest.\nThe NASA GISS team chose the period of 1951-1980 as its baseline largely because the U.S. National Weather Service uses a three-decade period to define \u201cnormal\u201d or average temperature. The GISS temperature analysis effort also began around 1980, so the most recent 30 years was 1951-1980. Their objective is to provide an estimate of temperature change that could be compared with predictions of global climate change in response to atmospheric carbon dioxide, aerosols, and changes in solar activity.\nNASA\u2019s temperature analyses incorporate surface temperature measurements from more than 20,000 weather stations, ship- and buoy-based observations of sea surface temperatures, and temperature measurements from Antarctic research stations. These in situ measurements are analyzed using an algorithm that considers the varied spacing of temperature stations around the globe and urban heat island effects.\nSubscribe to the Earth Observatory and get the Earth in your inbox.\nNASA's Earth Observatory brings you the Earth, every day, with in-depth stories and stunning imagery.\nExplore Earth Science\nEarth Science Data\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The largest ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nThe Sun serves as the primary energy source for Earth\u2019s climate. Some of the incoming sunlight is reflected directly back into space, especially by bright surfaces such as ice and clouds, and the rest is absorbed by the surface and the atmosphere. Much of this absorbed solar energy is re-emitted as heat (longwave or infrared radiation). The atmosphere in turn absorbs and re-radiates heat, some of which escapes to space. Any disturbance to this balance of incoming and outgoing energy will affect the climate. For example, small changes in the output of energy from the Sun will affect this balance directly.\nIf all heat energy emitted from the surface passed through the atmosphere directly into space, Earth\u2019s average surface temperature would be tens of degrees colder than today. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, including water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, act to make the surface much warmer than this because they absorb and emit heat energy in all directions (including downwards), keeping Earth\u2019s surface and lower atmosphere warm [Figure B1]. Without this greenhouse effect, life as we know it could not have evolved on our planet. Adding more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere makes it even more effective at preventing heat from escaping into space. When the energy leaving is less than the energy entering, Earth warms until a new balance is established.\nGreenhouse gases emitted by human activities alter Earth\u2019s energy balance and thus its climate. Humans also affect climate by changing the nature of the land surfaces (for example by clearing forests for farming) and through the emission of pollutants that affect the amount and type of particles in the atmosphere.\nScientists have determined that, when all human and natural factors are considered, Earth\u2019s climate balance has been altered towards warming, with the biggest contributor being increases in CO2.\nFigure b1. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, including water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, absorb heat energy and emit it in all directions (including downwards), keeping Earth\u2019s surface and lower atmosphere warm. Adding more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere enhances the effect, making Earth\u2019s surface and lower atmosphere even warmer. Image based on a figure from US EPA.\nThe atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide have increased significantly since the Industrial Revolution began. In the case of carbon dioxide, the average concentration measured at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii has risen from 316 parts per million (ppm) in 1959 (the first full year of data available) to more than 411 ppm in 2019 [Figure B2]. The same rates of increase have since been recorded at numerous other stations worldwide. Since preindustrial times, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 has increased by over 40%, methane has increased by more than 150%, and nitrous oxide has increased by roughly 20%. More than half of the increase in CO2 has occurred since 1970. Increases in all three gases contribute to warming of Earth, with the increase in CO2 playing the largest role. See page B3 to learn about the sources of human emitted greenhouse gases. Learn about the sources of human emitted greenhouse gases.\nScientists have examined greenhouse gases in the context of the past. Analysis of air trapped inside ice that has been accumulating over time in Antarctica shows that the CO2 concentration began to increase significantly in the 19th century [Figure B3], after staying in the range of 260 to 280 ppm for the previous 10,000 years. Ice core records extending back 800,000 years show that during that time, CO2 concentrations remained within the range of 170 to 300 ppm throughout many \u201cice age\u201d cycles - learn about the ice ages - and no concentration above 300 ppm is seen in ice core records until the past 200 years.\nMeasurements of the forms (isotopes) of carbon in the modern atmosphere show a clear fingerprint of the addition of \u201cold\u201d carbon (depleted in natural radioactive 14C) coming from the combustion of fossil fuels (as opposed to \u201cnewer\u201d carbon coming from living systems). In addition, it is known that human activities (excluding land use changes) currently emit an estimated 10 billion tonnes of carbon each year, mostly by burning fossil fuels, which is more than enough to explain the observed increase in concentration. These and other lines of evidence point conclusively to the fact that the elevated CO2 concentration in our atmosphere is the result of human activities.\nFig b2. Measurements of atmospheric CO2 since 1958 from the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii (black) and from the South Pole (red) show a steady annual increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration. The measurements are made at remote places like these because they are not greatly influenced by local processes, so therefore they are representative of the background atmosphere. The small up-and-down saw-tooth pattern reflects seasonal changes in the release and uptake of CO2 by plants. Source: Scripps CO2 Program\nFigure b3. CO2 variations during the past 1,000 years, obtained from analysis of air trapped in an ice core extracted from Antarctica (red squares), show a sharp rise in atmospheric CO2 starting in the late 19th century. Modern atmospheric measurements from Mauna Loa are superimposed in gray. Source: figure by Eric Wolff, data from Etheridge et al., 1996; MacFarling Meure et al., 2006; Scripps CO2 Program.\nEstimating global average surface air temperature increase requires careful analysis of millions of measurements from around the world, including from land stations, ships, and satellites. Despite the many complications of synthesising such data, multiple independent teams have concluded separately and unanimously that global average surface air temperature has risen by about 1 \u00b0C (1.8 \u00b0F) since 1900 [Figure B4].

In 1953, a decade before he was born, massive flooding in his native country killed more than 1,800 people and displaced 70,000 more. During a two-day storm surge that also destroyed 10,000 buildings, nearly a tenth of all Dutch farmland disappeared beneath the water.\nWith almost a third of the Netherlands resting below sea level, the Dutch, Van Lohuizen says, have always been \u201caware of how vulnerable their country can be.\u201d So important is flood management to Dutch society that schoolchildren are required to draw pictures proving their basic knowledge of dyke engineering.\nToday, nearly 70 years after that destructive Dutch flood, rising waters from the North Sea to the Bay of Bengal to the Pacific Rim to the Atlantic coasts of the Americas are threatening the lives and homes of billions of people. And waters aren\u2019t just rising higher: They\u2019re rising higher faster. According to the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, global mean sea level rose by about 0.06 inch annually over the first 90 years of the 20th century. But in the single decade between 2005 and 2015, that rate accelerated to 0.14 inch per year. If global greenhouse emissions aren\u2019t curbed, IPCC experts warn, sea level is likely to rise between 2 to 3.6 feet by the end of this century\u2014and a rise as high as 6.5 feet \u201ccannot be ruled out.\u201d In almost every scenario, the authors note, \u201cextreme sea level events that were rare over the last century will become common before 2100, and even by 2050 in many locations.\u201d\nTen years ago, Van Lohuizen began photographing the impacts of these extreme events around the world. His photos\u2014taken over the course of several years in Greenland, the Netherlands, the United States, Panama, Indonesia, Bangladesh, and several Pacific island nations\u2014tell stories of devastation, but also of human beings\u2019 extraordinary gifts for creativity and adaptation.\nNow they can be experienced in a volume that combines these many different stories into a single, powerful account. In its 286 pages, After Us the Deluge: The Human Consequences of Rising Sea Levels from Lannoo Publishers shows us, in stark and vivid detail, what climate change\u2019s human toll actually looks like. (The book has been published in conjunction with an exhibit, Rising Tide: Visualizing the Human Costs of the Climate Crisis, on display at the Museum of the City of New York through the end of the year.)\nThe world can\u2019t afford to ignore these images. Many of his subjects, Van Lohuizen says, \u201cfeel like they aren't being heard, like they aren\u2019t being listened to. Especially in places like Bangladesh or the Pacific states, these people feel like they are having to pay the highest price for a problem that they didn\u2019t play any part in creating.\u201d\nThe rapid melting of Greenland\u2019s ice sheet, the second-largest body of ice on earth after Antarctica, is the main driver of sea level rise around the globe. The melting season in Greenland\u2019s north now lasts 70 percent longer than it did just 50 years ago. And in 2012, surface melt, which normally affects only portions of the ice sheet during the summer, occurred across nearly the whole ice sheet for the first time in recorded history. Were the ice sheet to melt entirely, the earth\u2019s oceans would rise on average by nearly 23 feet, leading to worldwide catastrophe. Van Lohuizen\u2019s images of retreating glaciers are as beautiful as they are disturbing; other photos depict Greenland\u2019s relatively few inhabitants learning to adapt to their abruptly altered landscape and warming climate.\nNear the town of Ilulissat, Greenland, a massive piece of ice cleaves off Sermeq Kujalleq, one the world\u2019s fastest retreating glaciers.\nHigher temperatures in southern Greenland mean that families like this one can now grow crops\u2014such as lettuce and strawberries\u2014that previously wouldn\u2019t have survived here. Meanwhile, in Greenland\u2019s north, Indigenous hunters are having more difficulty finding food as wildlife struggle to adapt to their new ice-free habitat.\nAlthough rising sea levels threaten communities all along the U.S. coast, Van Lohuizen focused his camera on two major cities thought to be at special risk: New York City and Miami Beach. New York received a taste of what the future could hold during Superstorm Sandy, a 900-mile-wide storm that battered the metropolitan area in 2012, killing dozens, destroying thousands of homes and businesses, and forcing the closure of the subway system and tunnels leading into and out of Manhattan. In Miami Beach, seasonal tidal surges frequently reverse the flow of the city\u2019s drainage system, pushing sewage-tainted seawater up through street-level storm drains. In his photographs of both cities, Van Lohuizen seems especially interested in the disconnect between the reality of sea level rise and the prospect of continued development\u2014especially the luxury buildings in some of Miami Beach\u2019s wealthiest communities, which also happen to be the ones most at risk of destruction.\nDuring king tide in Miami Beach, a worker checks on the status of a storm drain while almost completely submerged in seawater.\nIn 2011, Van Lohuizen went to northern Panama as part of a project on mass migration. While staying with the Indigenous peoples of the San Blas archipelago, he learned just how significant a factor sea level rise was in their displacement\u2014and\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Information.\nAccording to the annual report from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, 2024 was the warmest year since global records began in 1850. The global average surface temperature was 2.32 Fahrenheit (1.29 degrees Celsius) above the 20th-century average (57.0 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.9 degrees Celsius) and 2.63 degrees Fahrenheit (1.46 degrees Celsius) above the pre-industrial average (56.7 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.7 degrees Celsius), which NOAA defines as the period from 1850-1900.\nGlobal temperatures in 2024 were above the 1991-2020 average (red) across most of the planet. Yearly temperatures compared to the 20th-century average (bar chart) show that it has been 48 years since Earth had a cooler-than-average year. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe 2024 global temperature anomaly (anomaly means \u201cdifference from average\u201d) is 0.18 degrees F (0.10 degrees C) warmer than the previous record, set the year before, in 2023. The ten warmest years in the 175-year record have all occurred during the last decade (2015\u20132024). When the new century started in 2000, the first year to set a new high-temperature record was 2005. Now, 2005 is just the 13th-warmest year on record.\nOther 2024 rankings included...\nFor more regional details and 2024 climate statistics, see the 2024 Global Climate Report from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe global average surface temperature is an indicator of the state of Earth\u2019s energy balance: how much sunlight it absorbs minus how much heat it radiates back to space. When these amounts are the same, Earth\u2019s average surface temperature remains steady. When they are out of balance, Earth cools or warms. Earth\u2019s average surface temperature has been rising because human-produced greenhouse gases are causing Earth to absorb more energy than it radiates back to space.\nGiven the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of added heat energy to raise Earth\u2019s average surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree-Fahrenheit (1-degree-Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1850-1900 in NOAA's record) might seem small, but it represents a significant increase in heat energy circulating through all parts of the Earth system, including the oceans, frozen landscapes, and the atmosphere.\nBeyond being an indicator of changes in Earth\u2019s energy balance, surface temperature matters because it controls many environmental and ecological processes that are important to humans and other life, including the water cycle (evaporation, clouds, surface water supplies, and precipitation), the carbon cycle, and the kinds of plants, animals, and other living things that can survive in different places on Earth.\nThe concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (55 degrees Celsius) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the \"average\" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget, which can only be directly measured from space.\nTo calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute temperature readings to temperature anomalies\u2014the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend.\nAcross inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and known physical relationships\u2014such as the way temperature decreases with altitude\u2014to estimate the missing values. Each value is then used to calculate a global-scale temperature anomaly. This process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in Earth's surface temperature over time. Read more about how the global surface temperature record is built in our Climate Data Primer.\nTemperature change has not been uniform across the planet, but more areas are warming than cooling. And the rate of warming has accelerated in recent decades. According to NOAA's 2024 Annual Climate Report the combined land and ocean temperature has warmed at an average rate of 0.11 degrees Fahrenheit (0.06 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1850 and more than three times that rate (0.36 degrees Fahrenheit, or 0.20 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1975.\nRecent rates of global warming (1994-2024, bottom) are larger than the longer-term average rates (1901-2024, top). Places that have cooled are colored blue; places that have warmed are colored yellow, orange, or red. In the past three decades, many places in the Northern Hemisphere have warmed by 1 degree Fahrenheit or more per decade. Differences are most dramatic in the Arctic. With the decline of ice and snow, the Arctic reflects less incoming sunlight, which amplifies the rate of greenhouse-gas-driven warming. NOAA Climate.gov, based o\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Lee, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory\nSea level rise is affecting coastal communities around the world, especially those like Honolulu, pictured, that are located on islands\nCredit: NOAA Teacher at Sea Program, NOAA Ship HI\u2019IALAKAI\nA long-term sea level dataset shows ocean surface heights continuing to rise at faster and faster rates over decades of observations.\nGlobal average sea level rose by about 0.3 inches (0.76 centimeters) from 2022 to 2023, a relatively large jump due mostly to a warming climate and the development of a strong El Ni\u00f1o. The total rise is equivalent to draining a quarter of Lake Superior into the ocean over the course of a year.\nThis NASA-led analysis is based on a sea level dataset featuring more than 30 years of satellite observations, starting with the U.S.-French TOPEX/Poseidon mission, which launched in 1992. The Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich mission, which launched in November 2020, is the latest in the series of satellites that have contributed to this sea level record.\nThe data shows that global average sea level has risen a total of about 4 inches (9.4 centimeters) since 1993. The rate of this increase has also accelerated, more than doubling from 0.07 inches (0.18 centimeters) per year in 1993 to the current rate of 0.17 inches (0.42 centimeters) per year.\n\u201cCurrent rates of acceleration mean that we are on track to add another 20 centimeters of global mean sea level by 2050, doubling the amount of change in the next three decades compared to the previous 100 years and increasing the frequency and impacts of floods across the world,\u201d said Nadya Vinogradova Shiffer, director for the NASA sea level change team and the ocean physics program in Washington.\nSeasonal Effects\nGlobal sea level saw a significant jump from 2022 to 2023 due mainly to a switch between La Ni\u00f1a and El Ni\u00f1o conditions. A mild La Ni\u00f1a from 2021 to 2022 resulted in a lower-than-expected rise in sea level that year. A strong El Ni\u00f1o developed in 2023, helping to boost the average amount of rise in sea surface height.\nLa Ni\u00f1a is characterized by cooler-than-normal ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. El Ni\u00f1o involves warmer-than-average ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific. Both periodic climate phenomena affect patterns of rainfall and snowfall as well as sea levels around the world.\n\u201cDuring La Ni\u00f1a, rain that normally falls in the ocean falls on the land instead, temporarily taking water out of the ocean and lowering sea levels,\u201d said Josh Willis, a sea level researcher at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \u201cIn El Ni\u00f1o years, a lot of the rain that normally falls on land ends up in the ocean, which raises sea levels temporarily.\u201d\nA Human Footprint\nSeasonal or periodic climate phenomena can affect global average sea level from year to year. But the underlying trend for more than three decades has been increasing ocean heights as a direct response to global warming due to the excessive heat trapped by greenhouse gases in Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\u201cLong-term datasets like this 30-year satellite record allow us to differentiate between short-term effects on sea level, like El Ni\u00f1o, and trends that let us know where sea level is heading,\u201d said Ben Hamlington, lead for NASA\u2019s sea level change team at JPL.\nThese multidecadal observations wouldn\u2019t be possible without ongoing international cooperation, as well as scientific and technical innovations by NASA and other space agencies. Specifically, radar altimeters have helped produce ever-more precise measurements of sea level around the world. To calculate ocean height, these instruments bounce microwave signals off the sea surface, recording the time the signal takes to travel from a satellite to Earth and back, as well as the strength of the return signal.\nThe researchers also periodically cross-check those sea level measurements against data from other sources. These include tide gauges, as well as satellite measurements of factors like atmospheric water vapor and Earth\u2019s gravity field that can affect the accuracy of sea level measurements. Using that information, the researchers recalibrated the 30-year dataset, resulting in updates to sea levels in some previous years. That includes a sea level rise increase of 0.08 inches (0.21 centimeters) from 2021 to 2022.\nWhen researchers combine space-based altimetry data of the oceans with more than a century of observations from surface-based sources, such as tide gauges, the information dramatically improves our understanding of how sea surface height is changing on a global scale. When these sea level measurements are combined with other information, including ocean temperature, ice loss, and land motion, scientists can decipher why and how seas are rising.\nSite Manager: Carmen Blackwood NASA Responsible Official: Doug Newman\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Information.\nAccording to the annual report from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, 2024 was the warmest year since global records began in 1850. The global average surface temperature was 2.32 Fahrenheit (1.29 degrees Celsius) above the 20th-century average (57.0 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.9 degrees Celsius) and 2.63 degrees Fahrenheit (1.46 degrees Celsius) above the pre-industrial average (56.7 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.7 degrees Celsius), which NOAA defines as the period from 1850-1900.\nGlobal temperatures in 2024 were above the 1991-2020 average (red) across most of the planet. Yearly temperatures compared to the 20th-century average (bar chart) show that it has been 48 years since Earth had a cooler-than-average year. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe 2024 global temperature anomaly (anomaly means \u201cdifference from average\u201d) is 0.18 degrees F (0.10 degrees C) warmer than the previous record, set the year before, in 2023. The ten warmest years in the 175-year record have all occurred during the last decade (2015\u20132024). When the new century started in 2000, the first year to set a new high-temperature record was 2005. Now, 2005 is just the 13th-warmest year on record.\nOther 2024 rankings included...\nFor more regional details and 2024 climate statistics, see the 2024 Global Climate Report from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe global average surface temperature is an indicator of the state of Earth\u2019s energy balance: how much sunlight it absorbs minus how much heat it radiates back to space. When these amounts are the same, Earth\u2019s average surface temperature remains steady. When they are out of balance, Earth cools or warms. Earth\u2019s average surface temperature has been rising because human-produced greenhouse gases are causing Earth to absorb more energy than it radiates back to space.\nGiven the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of added heat energy to raise Earth\u2019s average surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree-Fahrenheit (1-degree-Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1850-1900 in NOAA's record) might seem small, but it represents a significant increase in heat energy circulating through all parts of the Earth system, including the oceans, frozen landscapes, and the atmosphere.\nBeyond being an indicator of changes in Earth\u2019s energy balance, surface temperature matters because it controls many environmental and ecological processes that are important to humans and other life, including the water cycle (evaporation, clouds, surface water supplies, and precipitation), the carbon cycle, and the kinds of plants, animals, and other living things that can survive in different places on Earth.\nThe concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (55 degrees Celsius) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the \"average\" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget, which can only be directly measured from space.\nTo calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute temperature readings to temperature anomalies\u2014the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend.\nAcross inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and known physical relationships\u2014such as the way temperature decreases with altitude\u2014to estimate the missing values. Each value is then used to calculate a global-scale temperature anomaly. This process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in Earth's surface temperature over time. Read more about how the global surface temperature record is built in our Climate Data Primer.\nTemperature change has not been uniform across the planet, but more areas are warming than cooling. And the rate of warming has accelerated in recent decades. According to NOAA's 2024 Annual Climate Report the combined land and ocean temperature has warmed at an average rate of 0.11 degrees Fahrenheit (0.06 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1850 and more than three times that rate (0.36 degrees Fahrenheit, or 0.20 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1975.\nRecent rates of global warming (1994-2024, bottom) are larger than the longer-term average rates (1901-2024, top). Places that have cooled are colored blue; places that have warmed are colored yellow, orange, or red. In the past three decades, many places in the Northern Hemisphere have warmed by 1 degree Fahrenheit or more per decade. Differences are most dramatic in the Arctic. With the decline of ice and snow, the Arctic reflects less incoming sunlight, which amplifies the rate of greenhouse-gas-driven warming. NOAA Climate.gov, based o\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Lee, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory\nSea level rise is affecting coastal communities around the world, especially those like Honolulu, pictured, that are located on islands\nCredit: NOAA Teacher at Sea Program, NOAA Ship HI\u2019IALAKAI\nA long-term sea level dataset shows ocean surface heights continuing to rise at faster and faster rates over decades of observations.\nGlobal average sea level rose by about 0.3 inches (0.76 centimeters) from 2022 to 2023, a relatively large jump due mostly to a warming climate and the development of a strong El Ni\u00f1o. The total rise is equivalent to draining a quarter of Lake Superior into the ocean over the course of a year.\nThis NASA-led analysis is based on a sea level dataset featuring more than 30 years of satellite observations, starting with the U.S.-French TOPEX/Poseidon mission, which launched in 1992. The Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich mission, which launched in November 2020, is the latest in the series of satellites that have contributed to this sea level record.\nThe data shows that global average sea level has risen a total of about 4 inches (9.4 centimeters) since 1993. The rate of this increase has also accelerated, more than doubling from 0.07 inches (0.18 centimeters) per year in 1993 to the current rate of 0.17 inches (0.42 centimeters) per year.\n\u201cCurrent rates of acceleration mean that we are on track to add another 20 centimeters of global mean sea level by 2050, doubling the amount of change in the next three decades compared to the previous 100 years and increasing the frequency and impacts of floods across the world,\u201d said Nadya Vinogradova Shiffer, director for the NASA sea level change team and the ocean physics program in Washington.\nSeasonal Effects\nGlobal sea level saw a significant jump from 2022 to 2023 due mainly to a switch between La Ni\u00f1a and El Ni\u00f1o conditions. A mild La Ni\u00f1a from 2021 to 2022 resulted in a lower-than-expected rise in sea level that year. A strong El Ni\u00f1o developed in 2023, helping to boost the average amount of rise in sea surface height.\nLa Ni\u00f1a is characterized by cooler-than-normal ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. El Ni\u00f1o involves warmer-than-average ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific. Both periodic climate phenomena affect patterns of rainfall and snowfall as well as sea levels around the world.\n\u201cDuring La Ni\u00f1a, rain that normally falls in the ocean falls on the land instead, temporarily taking water out of the ocean and lowering sea levels,\u201d said Josh Willis, a sea level researcher at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \u201cIn El Ni\u00f1o years, a lot of the rain that normally falls on land ends up in the ocean, which raises sea levels temporarily.\u201d\nA Human Footprint\nSeasonal or periodic climate phenomena can affect global average sea level from year to year. But the underlying trend for more than three decades has been increasing ocean heights as a direct response to global warming due to the excessive heat trapped by greenhouse gases in Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\u201cLong-term datasets like this 30-year satellite record allow us to differentiate between short-term effects on sea level, like El Ni\u00f1o, and trends that let us know where sea level is heading,\u201d said Ben Hamlington, lead for NASA\u2019s sea level change team at JPL.\nThese multidecadal observations wouldn\u2019t be possible without ongoing international cooperation, as well as scientific and technical innovations by NASA and other space agencies. Specifically, radar altimeters have helped produce ever-more precise measurements of sea level around the world. To calculate ocean height, these instruments bounce microwave signals off the sea surface, recording the time the signal takes to travel from a satellite to Earth and back, as well as the strength of the return signal.\nThe researchers also periodically cross-check those sea level measurements against data from other sources. These include tide gauges, as well as satellite measurements of factors like atmospheric water vapor and Earth\u2019s gravity field that can affect the accuracy of sea level measurements. Using that information, the researchers recalibrated the 30-year dataset, resulting in updates to sea levels in some previous years. That includes a sea level rise increase of 0.08 inches (0.21 centimeters) from 2021 to 2022.\nWhen researchers combine space-based altimetry data of the oceans with more than a century of observations from surface-based sources, such as tide gauges, the information dramatically improves our understanding of how sea surface height is changing on a global scale. When these sea level measurements are combined with other information, including ocean temperature, ice loss, and land motion, scientists can decipher why and how seas are rising.\nSite Manager: Carmen Blackwood NASA Responsible Official: Doug Newman\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

While natural variability plays some part, the preponderance of evidence indicates that human activities\u2014particularly emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases\u2014are mostly responsible for making our planet warmer.\nAccording to an ongoing temperature analysis led by scientists at NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), the average global temperature on Earth has increased by at least 1.1\u00b0 Celsius (1.9\u00b0 Fahrenheit) since 1880. The majority of the warming has occurred since 1975, at a rate of roughly 0.15 to 0.20\u00b0C per decade.\nThe maps above show temperature anomalies in five-year increments since 1880. (Click on the arrow to run the animation.) These are not absolute temperatures, but changes from the norm for each area. The data reflect how much warmer or cooler each region was compared to a base period of 1951-1980. (The global mean surface air temperature for that period was 14\u00b0C (57\u00b0F), with an uncertainty of several tenths of a degree.)\nThe image below shows global temperature anomalies in 2022, which tied for the fifth warmest year on record. The past nine years have been the warmest years since modern recordkeeping began in 1880.\nAs the maps show, global warming does not mean temperatures rise everywhere at every time by same rate. Temperatures might rise 5 degrees in one region and drop 2 degrees in another. For instance, exceptionally cold winters in one place might be balanced by extremely warm winters in another part of the world. Generally, warming is greater over land than over the oceans because water is slower to absorb and release heat (thermal inertia). Warming may also differ substantially within specific land masses and ocean basins.\nIn the animation at the top of the page and in the bar chart below, the years from 1880 to 1939 tend to be cooler, then level off by the 1950s. Decades within the base period (1951-1980) do not appear particularly warm or cold because they are the standard against which other years are measured.\nThe leveling off of temperatures in the middle of the 20th century can be explained by natural variability and by the cooling effects of aerosols generated by factories, power plants, and motor vehicles in the years of rapid economic growth after World War II. Fossil fuel use also increased after the war (5 percent per year), boosting greenhouse gases. Cooling from aerosol pollution happened rapidly. In contrast, greenhouse gases accumulated slowly, but they remain in the atmosphere for a much longer time. According to former GISS director James Hansen, the strong warming trend of the past four decades likely reflects a shift from balanced aerosol and greenhouse gas effects on the atmosphere to a predominance of greenhouse gas effects after aerosols were curbed by pollution controls.\nWhy should we care about one or two degrees of global warming? After all, temperatures fluctuate by many degrees every day where we live.\nThe temperatures we experience locally and in short periods can fluctuate significantly due to predictable, cyclical events (night and day, summer and winter) and hard-to-predict wind and precipitation patterns. But the global temperature mainly depends on how much energy the planet receives from the Sun and how much it radiates back into space. The energy coming from the Sun fluctuates very little by year, while the amount of energy radiated by Earth is closely tied to the chemical composition of the atmosphere\u2014particularly the amount of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.\nA one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all of the oceans, the atmosphere, and the land masses by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age. A five-degree drop was enough to bury a large part of North America under a towering mass of ice 20,000 years ago.\nGlobal temperature records start around 1880 because observations did not sufficiently cover enough of the planet prior to that time. The line plot above shows yearly temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2020 as recorded by NASA, NOAA, the Berkeley Earth research group, the Met Office Hadley Centre (United Kingdom), and the Cowtan and Way analysis. Though there are minor variations from year to year, all five records show peaks and valleys in sync with each other. All show rapid warming in the past few decades, and all show the last decade as the warmest.\nThe NASA GISS team chose the period of 1951-1980 as its baseline largely because the U.S. National Weather Service uses a three-decade period to define \u201cnormal\u201d or average temperature. The GISS temperature analysis effort also began around 1980, so the most recent 30 years was 1951-1980. Their objective is to provide an estimate of temperature change that could be compared with predictions of global climate change in response to atmospheric carbon dioxide, aerosols, and changes in solar activity.\nNASA\u2019s temperature analyses incorporate surface temperature measurements from more than 20,000 weather stations, ship- and buoy-based observations of sea surface temperatures, and temperature measurements from Antarctic research stations. These in situ measurements are analyzed using an algorithm that considers the varied spacing of temperature stations around the globe and urban heat island effects.\nSubscribe to the Earth Observatory and get the Earth in your inbox.\nNASA's Earth Observatory brings you the Earth, every day, with in-depth stories and stunning imagery.\nExplore Earth Science\nEarth Science Data\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Blue bars indicate cooler-than-average years; red bars show warmer-than-average years. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Information.\nAccording to the annual report from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, 2024 was the warmest year since global records began in 1850. The global average surface temperature was 2.32 Fahrenheit (1.29 degrees Celsius) above the 20th-century average (57.0 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.9 degrees Celsius) and 2.63 degrees Fahrenheit (1.46 degrees Celsius) above the pre-industrial average (56.7 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.7 degrees Celsius), which NOAA defines as the period from 1850-1900.\nGlobal temperatures in 2024 were above the 1991-2020 average (red) across most of the planet. Yearly temperatures compared to the 20th-century average (bar chart) show that it has been 48 years since Earth had a cooler-than-average year. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe 2024 global temperature anomaly (anomaly means \u201cdifference from average\u201d) is 0.18 degrees F (0.10 degrees C) warmer than the previous record, set the year before, in 2023. The ten warmest years in the 175-year record have all occurred during the last decade (2015\u20132024). When the new century started in 2000, the first year to set a new high-temperature record was 2005. Now, 2005 is just the 13th-warmest year on record.\nOther 2024 rankings included...\nFor more regional details and 2024 climate statistics, see the 2024 Global Climate Report from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe global average surface temperature is an indicator of the state of Earth\u2019s energy balance: how much sunlight it absorbs minus how much heat it radiates back to space. When these amounts are the same, Earth\u2019s average surface temperature remains steady. When they are out of balance, Earth cools or warms. Earth\u2019s average surface temperature has been rising because human-produced greenhouse gases are causing Earth to absorb more energy than it radiates back to space.\nGiven the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of added heat energy to raise Earth\u2019s average surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree-Fahrenheit (1-degree-Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1850-1900 in NOAA's record) might seem small, but it represents a significant increase in heat energy circulating through all parts of the Earth system, including the oceans, frozen landscapes, and the atmosphere.\nBeyond being an indicator of changes in Earth\u2019s energy balance, surface temperature matters because it controls many environmental and ecological processes that are important to humans and other life, including the water cycle (evaporation, clouds, surface water supplies, and precipitation), the carbon cycle, and the kinds of plants, animals, and other living things that can survive in different places on Earth.\nThe concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (55 degrees Celsius) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the \"average\" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget, which can only be directly measured from space.\nTo calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute temperature readings to temperature anomalies\u2014the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend.\nAcross inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and known physical relationships\u2014such as the way temperature decreases with altitude\u2014to estimate the missing values. Each value is then used to calculate a global-scale temperature anomaly. This process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in Earth's surface temperature over time. Read more about how the global surface temperature record is built in our Climate Data Primer.\nTemperature change has not been uniform across the planet, but more areas are warming than cooling. And the rate of warming has accelerated in recent decades. According to NOAA's 2024 Annual Climate Report the combined land and ocean temperature has warmed at an average rate of 0.11 degrees Fahrenheit (0.06 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1850 and more than three times that rate (0.36 degrees Fahrenheit, or 0.20 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1975.\nRecent rates of global warming (1994-2024, bottom) are larger than the longer-term average rates (1901-2024, top). Places that have cooled are colored blue; places that have warmed are colored yellow, orange, or red. In the past three decades, many places in the Northern Hemisphere have warmed by 1 degree Fahrenheit or more per decade. Differences are most dramatic in the Arctic. With the decline of ice and snow, the Arctic reflects less incoming sunlight, which amplifies the rate of greenhouse-gas-driven warming. NOAA Climate.gov, based o\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Human and Natural Causes - NRDC\n\nGoogle Search Snippet:\nHuman-driven causes of climate change: Transportation, Electricity generation, Industry & manufacturing, Agriculture, Oil & gas development, Buildings, ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nPaul Souders/Getty Images\nYour gift DOUBLES to help NRDC defend endangered species, clean air and water, and public lands.\nWe can\u2019t fight climate change without understanding what drives it.\nLow water levels at Shasta Lake, California, following a historic drought in October 2021\nAndrew Innerarity/California Department of Water Resources\nAt the root of climate change is the phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect, the term scientists use to describe the way that certain atmospheric gases \u201ctrap\u201d heat that would otherwise radiate upward, from the planet\u2019s surface, into outer space. On the one hand, we have the greenhouse effect to thank for the presence of life on earth; without it, our planet would be cold and unlivable.\nBut beginning in the mid- to late-19th century, human activity began pushing the greenhouse effect to new levels. The result? A planet that\u2019s warmer right now than at any other point in human history, and getting ever warmer. This global warming has, in turn, dramatically altered natural cycles and weather patterns, with impacts that include extreme heat, protracted drought, increased flooding, more intense storms, and rising sea levels. Taken together, these miserable and sometimes deadly effects are what have come to be known as climate change.\nDetailing and discussing the human causes of climate change isn\u2019t about shaming people, or trying to make them feel guilty for their choices. It\u2019s about defining the problem so that we can arrive at effective solutions. And we must honestly address its origins\u2014even though it can sometimes be difficult, or even uncomfortable, to do so. Human civilization has made extraordinary productivity leaps, some of which have led to our currently overheated planet. But by harnessing that same ability to innovate and attaching it to a renewed sense of shared responsibility, we can find ways to cool the planet down, fight climate change, and chart a course toward a more just, equitable, and sustainable future.\nHere\u2019s a rough breakdown of the factors that are driving climate change.\nSome amount of climate change can be attributed to natural phenomena. Over the course of Earth\u2019s existence, volcanic eruptions, fluctuations in solar radiation, tectonic shifts, and even small changes in our orbit have all had observable effects on planetary warming and cooling patterns.\nBut climate records are able to show that today\u2019s global warming\u2014particularly what has occured since the start of the industrial revolution\u2014is happening much, much faster than ever before. According to NASA, \u201c[t]hese natural causes are still in play today, but their influence is too small or they occur too slowly to explain the rapid warming seen in recent decades.\u201d And the records refute the misinformation that natural causes are the main culprits behind climate change, as some in the fossil fuel industry and conservative think tanks would like us to believe.\nChemical manufacturing plants emit fumes along Onondaga Lake in Solvay, New York, in the late-19th century. Over time, industrial development severely polluted the local area.\nLibrary of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division, Detroit Publishing Company Collection\nScientists agree that human activity is the primary driver of what we\u2019re seeing now worldwide. (This type of climate change is sometimes referred to as anthropogenic, which is just a way of saying \u201ccaused by human beings.\u201d) The unchecked burning of fossil fuels over the past 150 years has drastically increased the presence of atmospheric greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide. At the same time, logging and development have led to the widespread destruction of forests, wetlands, and other carbon sinks\u2014natural resources that store carbon dioxide and prevent it from being released into the atmosphere.\nRight now, atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide are the highest they\u2019ve been in the last 800,000 years. Some greenhouse gases, like hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HFCs), do not even exist in nature. By continuously pumping these gases into the air, we helped raise the earth\u2019s average temperature by about 1.9 degrees Fahrenheit during the 20th century\u2014which has brought us to our current era of deadly, and increasingly routine, weather extremes. And it\u2019s important to note that while climate change affects everyone in some way, it doesn\u2019t do so equally: All over the world, people of color and those living in economically disadvantaged or politically marginalized communities bear a much larger burden, despite the fact that these communities play a much smaller role in warming the planet.\nOur ways of generating power for electricity, heat, and transportation, our built environment and industries, our ways of interacting with the land, and our consumption habits together serve as the primary drivers of climate change. While the percentages of greenhouse gases stemming from each source may fluctuate, the sources themselves remain relatively consistent.\nTraffic on Interstate 25 in Denver\nDavid Parsons/iStock\nThe cars, trucks, ships, and planes that we use to transport ourselves and our goods are a major source of global greenhouse gas emissions. (In the United States, they actually constitute the single-largest source.) Burning petroleum-based fuel in combustion engines releases massive amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Passenger cars account for 41 percent of those emissions, with the typical passenger vehicle emitting about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. And trucks are by far the worst polluters on the road. They run almost constantly and largely burn diesel fuel, which is why, despite accounting for just 4 percent of U.S. vehicles, trucks emit 23 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions from transportation.\nWe can get these numbers down, but we need large-scale investments to get more zero-emission vehicles on the road and increase access to reliable public transit.\nAs of 2021, nearly 60 per\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

While natural variability plays some part, the preponderance of evidence indicates that human activities\u2014particularly emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases\u2014are mostly responsible for making our planet warmer.\nAccording to an ongoing temperature analysis led by scientists at NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), the average global temperature on Earth has increased by at least 1.1\u00b0 Celsius (1.9\u00b0 Fahrenheit) since 1880. The majority of the warming has occurred since 1975, at a rate of roughly 0.15 to 0.20\u00b0C per decade.\nThe maps above show temperature anomalies in five-year increments since 1880. (Click on the arrow to run the animation.) These are not absolute temperatures, but changes from the norm for each area. The data reflect how much warmer or cooler each region was compared to a base period of 1951-1980. (The global mean surface air temperature for that period was 14\u00b0C (57\u00b0F), with an uncertainty of several tenths of a degree.)\nThe image below shows global temperature anomalies in 2022, which tied for the fifth warmest year on record. The past nine years have been the warmest years since modern recordkeeping began in 1880.\nAs the maps show, global warming does not mean temperatures rise everywhere at every time by same rate. Temperatures might rise 5 degrees in one region and drop 2 degrees in another. For instance, exceptionally cold winters in one place might be balanced by extremely warm winters in another part of the world. Generally, warming is greater over land than over the oceans because water is slower to absorb and release heat (thermal inertia). Warming may also differ substantially within specific land masses and ocean basins.\nIn the animation at the top of the page and in the bar chart below, the years from 1880 to 1939 tend to be cooler, then level off by the 1950s. Decades within the base period (1951-1980) do not appear particularly warm or cold because they are the standard against which other years are measured.\nThe leveling off of temperatures in the middle of the 20th century can be explained by natural variability and by the cooling effects of aerosols generated by factories, power plants, and motor vehicles in the years of rapid economic growth after World War II. Fossil fuel use also increased after the war (5 percent per year), boosting greenhouse gases. Cooling from aerosol pollution happened rapidly. In contrast, greenhouse gases accumulated slowly, but they remain in the atmosphere for a much longer time. According to former GISS director James Hansen, the strong warming trend of the past four decades likely reflects a shift from balanced aerosol and greenhouse gas effects on the atmosphere to a predominance of greenhouse gas effects after aerosols were curbed by pollution controls.\nWhy should we care about one or two degrees of global warming? After all, temperatures fluctuate by many degrees every day where we live.\nThe temperatures we experience locally and in short periods can fluctuate significantly due to predictable, cyclical events (night and day, summer and winter) and hard-to-predict wind and precipitation patterns. But the global temperature mainly depends on how much energy the planet receives from the Sun and how much it radiates back into space. The energy coming from the Sun fluctuates very little by year, while the amount of energy radiated by Earth is closely tied to the chemical composition of the atmosphere\u2014particularly the amount of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.\nA one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all of the oceans, the atmosphere, and the land masses by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age. A five-degree drop was enough to bury a large part of North America under a towering mass of ice 20,000 years ago.\nGlobal temperature records start around 1880 because observations did not sufficiently cover enough of the planet prior to that time. The line plot above shows yearly temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2020 as recorded by NASA, NOAA, the Berkeley Earth research group, the Met Office Hadley Centre (United Kingdom), and the Cowtan and Way analysis. Though there are minor variations from year to year, all five records show peaks and valleys in sync with each other. All show rapid warming in the past few decades, and all show the last decade as the warmest.\nThe NASA GISS team chose the period of 1951-1980 as its baseline largely because the U.S. National Weather Service uses a three-decade period to define \u201cnormal\u201d or average temperature. The GISS temperature analysis effort also began around 1980, so the most recent 30 years was 1951-1980.

NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Information.\nAccording to the annual report from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, 2024 was the warmest year since global records began in 1850. The global average surface temperature was 2.32 Fahrenheit (1.29 degrees Celsius) above the 20th-century average (57.0 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.9 degrees Celsius) and 2.63 degrees Fahrenheit (1.46 degrees Celsius) above the pre-industrial average (56.7 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.7 degrees Celsius), which NOAA defines as the period from 1850-1900.\nGlobal temperatures in 2024 were above the 1991-2020 average (red) across most of the planet. Yearly temperatures compared to the 20th-century average (bar chart) show that it has been 48 years since Earth had a cooler-than-average year. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe 2024 global temperature anomaly (anomaly means \u201cdifference from average\u201d) is 0.18 degrees F (0.10 degrees C) warmer than the previous record, set the year before, in 2023. The ten warmest years in the 175-year record have all occurred during the last decade (2015\u20132024). When the new century started in 2000, the first year to set a new high-temperature record was 2005. Now, 2005 is just the 13th-warmest year on record.\nOther 2024 rankings included...\nFor more regional details and 2024 climate statistics, see the 2024 Global Climate Report from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe global average surface temperature is an indicator of the state of Earth\u2019s energy balance: how much sunlight it absorbs minus how much heat it radiates back to space. When these amounts are the same, Earth\u2019s average surface temperature remains steady. When they are out of balance, Earth cools or warms. Earth\u2019s average surface temperature has been rising because human-produced greenhouse gases are causing Earth to absorb more energy than it radiates back to space.\nGiven the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of added heat energy to raise Earth\u2019s average surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree-Fahrenheit (1-degree-Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1850-1900 in NOAA's record) might seem small, but it represents a significant increase in heat energy circulating through all parts of the Earth system, including the oceans, frozen landscapes, and the atmosphere.\nBeyond being an indicator of changes in Earth\u2019s energy balance, surface temperature matters because it controls many environmental and ecological processes that are important to humans and other life, including the water cycle (evaporation, clouds, surface water supplies, and precipitation), the carbon cycle, and the kinds of plants, animals, and other living things that can survive in different places on Earth.\nThe concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (55 degrees Celsius) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the \"average\" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget, which can only be directly measured from space.\nTo calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute temperature readings to temperature anomalies\u2014the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend.\nAcross inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and known physical relationships\u2014such as the way temperature decreases with altitude\u2014to estimate the missing values. Each value is then used to calculate a global-scale temperature anomaly. This process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in Earth's surface temperature over time. Read more about how the global surface temperature record is built in our Climate Data Primer.\nTemperature change has not been uniform across the planet, but more areas are warming than cooling. And the rate of warming has accelerated in recent decades. According to NOAA's 2024 Annual Climate Report the combined land and ocean temperature has warmed at an average rate of 0.11 degrees Fahrenheit (0.06 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1850 and more than three times that rate (0.36 degrees Fahrenheit, or 0.20 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1975.\nRecent rates of global warming (1994-2024, bottom) are larger than the longer-term average rates (1901-2024, top). Places that have cooled are colored blue; places that have warmed are colored yellow, orange, or red. In the past three decades, many places in the Northern Hemisphere have warmed by 1 degree Fahrenheit or more per decade. Differences are most dramatic in the Arctic. With the decline of ice and snow, the Arctic reflects less incoming sunlight, which amplifies the rate of greenhouse-gas-driven warming. NOAA Climate.gov, based o\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Here's why.\n\nFull Page Content:\nClimate change is one of the most urgent challenges facing humanity today. While many traditional industries have contributed to the environmental crisis, emerging technologies like blockchain, AI and robotics offer a path to solutions that were unimaginable even a few decades ago.\n\u2014\nEmerging technologies like blockchain, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, robotics, and extended reality are more than just buzzwords. While they weren\u2019t initially developed with sustainability or climate change in mind, these technologies are increasingly being leveraged to drive real, measurable impact in global environmental efforts.\nEarth.Org explores how each of these cutting-edge technologies is helping us tackle the biggest crisis of our time: climate change.\nBlockchain is a decentralized and distributed digital ledger technology that securely records transactions across a network of computers. Simply put, it is like a shared digital notebook where everyone can write entries, but no one can erase or change them once they are written.\nEvery transaction or piece of information is recorded in a block, and once a block is full, it is linked to the previous block, forming a secure and unbreakable chain of information.\nBecause this ledger is decentralized \u2013 or, in other words, it is maintained by many computers rather than a single authority \u2013 it is highly secure, transparent, and trustworthy.\nBlockchain technology was first conceptualized in 2008 by an anonymous person (or group) under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, as the underlying technology behind Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency.\nThe primary innovation of blockchain was the ability to allow peer-to-peer transactions without the need for an intermediary, such as a bank. It introduced a new level of security by using cryptographic principles to ensure the integrity and authenticity of data.\nWhile blockchain\u2019s association with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum is well-known, the technology\u2019s potential extends far beyond digital currencies. Over the years, blockchain has evolved into a versatile technology with a wide range of applications in industries like supply chain management, healthcare, finance, and, more recently, in efforts to combat climate change.\nBlockchain technology is gaining attention for its potential to help tackle climate change by improving transparency, efficiency, and accountability in a variety of environmental initiatives. Here\u2019s how blockchain is making an impact.\nCarbon credit and emission trading systems\nBlockchain is being used to create transparent and secure carbon markets, where carbon credits can be traded. Traditional carbon markets often suffer from inefficiencies, lack of transparency, and fraud. Blockchain ensures that every carbon credit transaction is securely recorded, providing confidence to buyers and sellers. This helps companies meet emissions reduction targets while maintaining integrity in the carbon trading process.\nCompanies like Toucan Protocol and AirCarbon Exchange, which provide platforms for the purchase and trade of tokenized carbon credits, use blockchain to guarantee real-time settlement of verified and traceable transactions.\nDecentralized renewable energy trading\nBlockchain enables peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading, which allows consumers to buy and sell renewable energy directly from each other without relying on utility companies. For example, homeowners with solar panels can sell excess energy to their neighbors through a decentralized platform powered by blockchain. This fosters local energy markets and encourages the use of renewable energy sources by making it easier for individuals to generate, share, and consume clean energy.\nPower ledger, an Australian company that focuses on trading renewable energy, was the first in the world to create and use a blockchain-based energy trading platform to establish and verify transparent and secure transactions.\nSupply chain transparency for sustainable products\nBlockchain is improving transparency in supply chains, particularly for sustainable and ethically sourced products. Businesses use it to track the journey of products from raw materials to end consumers, which allows them to verify that their products meet sustainability standards.\nThis transparency also helps reduce the environmental impact by identifying inefficiencies or areas where waste reduction can be implemented. For instance, blockchain is being used to trace the origin of sustainably sourced goods, such as timber or seafood, ensuring that they are not contributing to deforestation or overfishing.\nUnilever, a multinational giant in consumer products, uses blockchain to trace its palm oil supply chain to ensure sourcing that is entirely deforestation free.\nYou might also like: The Challenges of Sustainable Palm Oil Production and Consumption\nSmart contracts for green initiatives\nBlockchain-based smart contracts are being used to automate and enforce green initiatives. For example, a smart contract could automatically trigger the payment of funds for a renewable energy project once certain environmental performance metrics \u2013 such as energy generation or emissions reduction \u2013 are met. This ensures that financial resources are directed towards projects that make a measurable positive impact on the environment.\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. AI systems use algorithms and data to perform tasks such as problem-solving, decision-making, pattern recognition, and natural language processing.\nAI has evolved over the decades, with major advancements in machine learning and deep learning allowing machines to analyze vast amounts of data and make decisions autonomously.\nThe roots of AI can be traced back to the 1950s, when pioneers like Alan Turing and John McCarthy laid the foundations for what would become the field of AI. Turing proposed the idea of a machine that could i\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The total rise is equivalent to draining a quarter of Lake Superior into the ocean over the course of a year.\nThis NASA-led analysis is based on a sea level dataset featuring more than 30 years of satellite observations, starting with the U.S.-French TOPEX/Poseidon mission, which launched in 1992. The Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich mission, which launched in November 2020, is the latest in the series of satellites that have contributed to this sea level record.\nThe data shows that global average sea level has risen a total of about 4 inches (9.4 centimeters) since 1993. The rate of this increase has also accelerated, more than doubling from 0.07 inches (0.18 centimeters) per year in 1993 to the current rate of 0.17 inches (0.42 centimeters) per year.\n\u201cCurrent rates of acceleration mean that we are on track to add another 20 centimeters of global mean sea level by 2050, doubling the amount of change in the next three decades compared to the previous 100 years and increasing the frequency and impacts of floods across the world,\u201d said Nadya Vinogradova Shiffer, director for the NASA sea level change team and the ocean physics program in Washington.\nSeasonal Effects\nGlobal sea level saw a significant jump from 2022 to 2023 due mainly to a switch between La Ni\u00f1a and El Ni\u00f1o conditions. A mild La Ni\u00f1a from 2021 to 2022 resulted in a lower-than-expected rise in sea level that year. A strong El Ni\u00f1o developed in 2023, helping to boost the average amount of rise in sea surface height.\nLa Ni\u00f1a is characterized by cooler-than-normal ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. El Ni\u00f1o involves warmer-than-average ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific. Both periodic climate phenomena affect patterns of rainfall and snowfall as well as sea levels around the world.\n\u201cDuring La Ni\u00f1a, rain that normally falls in the ocean falls on the land instead, temporarily taking water out of the ocean and lowering sea levels,\u201d said Josh Willis, a sea level researcher at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \u201cIn El Ni\u00f1o years, a lot of the rain that normally falls on land ends up in the ocean, which raises sea levels temporarily.\u201d\nA Human Footprint\nSeasonal or periodic climate phenomena can affect global average sea level from year to year. But the underlying trend for more than three decades has been increasing ocean heights as a direct response to global warming due to the excessive heat trapped by greenhouse gases in Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\u201cLong-term datasets like this 30-year satellite record allow us to differentiate between short-term effects on sea level, like El Ni\u00f1o, and trends that let us know where sea level is heading,\u201d said Ben Hamlington, lead for NASA\u2019s sea level change team at JPL.\nThese multidecadal observations wouldn\u2019t be possible without ongoing international cooperation, as well as scientific and technical innovations by NASA and other space agencies. Specifically, radar altimeters have helped produce ever-more precise measurements of sea level around the world. To calculate ocean height, these instruments bounce microwave signals off the sea surface, recording the time the signal takes to travel from a satellite to Earth and back, as well as the strength of the return signal.\nThe researchers also periodically cross-check those sea level measurements against data from other sources. These include tide gauges, as well as satellite measurements of factors like atmospheric water vapor and Earth\u2019s gravity field that can affect the accuracy of sea level measurements. Using that information, the researchers recalibrated the 30-year dataset, resulting in updates to sea levels in some previous years. That includes a sea level rise increase of 0.08 inches (0.21 centimeters) from 2021 to 2022.\nWhen researchers combine space-based altimetry data of the oceans with more than a century of observations from surface-based sources, such as tide gauges, the information dramatically improves our understanding of how sea surface height is changing on a global scale. When these sea level measurements are combined with other information, including ocean temperature, ice loss, and land motion, scientists can decipher why and how seas are rising.\nSite Manager: Carmen Blackwood NASA Responsible Official: Doug Newman\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The rate of this increase has also accelerated, more than doubling from 0.07 inches (0.18 centimeters) per year in 1993 to the current rate of 0.17 inches (0.42 centimeters) per year.\n\u201cCurrent rates of acceleration mean that we are on track to add another 20 centimeters of global mean sea level by 2050, doubling the amount of change in the next three decades compared to the previous 100 years and increasing the frequency and impacts of floods across the world,\u201d said Nadya Vinogradova Shiffer, director for the NASA sea level change team and the ocean physics program in Washington.\nSeasonal Effects\nGlobal sea level saw a significant jump from 2022 to 2023 due mainly to a switch between La Ni\u00f1a and El Ni\u00f1o conditions. A mild La Ni\u00f1a from 2021 to 2022 resulted in a lower-than-expected rise in sea level that year. A strong El Ni\u00f1o developed in 2023, helping to boost the average amount of rise in sea surface height.\nLa Ni\u00f1a is characterized by cooler-than-normal ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. El Ni\u00f1o involves warmer-than-average ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific. Both periodic climate phenomena affect patterns of rainfall and snowfall as well as sea levels around the world.\n\u201cDuring La Ni\u00f1a, rain that normally falls in the ocean falls on the land instead, temporarily taking water out of the ocean and lowering sea levels,\u201d said Josh Willis, a sea level researcher at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \u201cIn El Ni\u00f1o years, a lot of the rain that normally falls on land ends up in the ocean, which raises sea levels temporarily.\u201d\nA Human Footprint\nSeasonal or periodic climate phenomena can affect global average sea level from year to year. But the underlying trend for more than three decades has been increasing ocean heights as a direct response to global warming due to the excessive heat trapped by greenhouse gases in Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\u201cLong-term datasets like this 30-year satellite record allow us to differentiate between short-term effects on sea level, like El Ni\u00f1o, and trends that let us know where sea level is heading,\u201d said Ben Hamlington, lead for NASA\u2019s sea level change team at JPL.\nThese multidecadal observations wouldn\u2019t be possible without ongoing international cooperation, as well as scientific and technical innovations by NASA and other space agencies. Specifically, radar altimeters have helped produce ever-more precise measurements of sea level around the world. To calculate ocean height, these instruments bounce microwave signals off the sea surface, recording the time the signal takes to travel from a satellite to Earth and back, as well as the strength of the return signal.\nThe researchers also periodically cross-check those sea level measurements against data from other sources. These include tide gauges, as well as satellite measurements of factors like atmospheric water vapor and Earth\u2019s gravity field that can affect the accuracy of sea level measurements. Using that information, the researchers recalibrated the 30-year dataset, resulting in updates to sea levels in some previous years. That includes a sea level rise increase of 0.08 inches (0.21 centimeters) from 2021 to 2022.\nWhen researchers combine space-based altimetry data of the oceans with more than a century of observations from surface-based sources, such as tide gauges, the information dramatically improves our understanding of how sea surface height is changing on a global scale. When these sea level measurements are combined with other information, including ocean temperature, ice loss, and land motion, scientists can decipher why and how seas are rising.\nSite Manager: Carmen Blackwood NASA Responsible Official: Doug Newman\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Scaling of these climate technologies is now more critical than ever as countries seek to reach climate goals of limiting global warming to well under 2\u00b0C above preindustrial levels, a goal that 196 nations committed to in the legally binding 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change.\nOur analysis suggests that, collectively, 12 categories of climate technologies could potentially reduce as much as 90 percent of total man-made greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions if deployed at scale.1 The interdependency among these technologies is very high, meaning that they must scale together. These technologies will need not only to be proven technically (as many already have) but also to become commercially viable. And, critically, the search for sustainable tech solutions to drive decarbonization will need to be pursued in parallel with other goals such as affordability and energy security.2\nThe maturity levels of the 12 technology categories are uneven: only 10 percent are commercially competitive, while a further 45 percent are commercially available but will require further cost reductions through innovation and scale-up to become competitive. The remainder hold great promise but are in earlier stages. The highest priority is therefore identifying, understanding, and prioritizing technical and commercial scaling mechanisms.\nThis article highlights the potential of these 12 technology categories along with their different maturity levels, the key scaling mechanisms, and some paths to overcoming scaling challenges. To spur innovation and reduce costs, our analysis suggests that climate tech investments would need to grow by about 10 percent each year and reach approximately $2 trillion by 2030, equivalent to about 1 percent to 2 percent of global GDP.3\nThe 12 categories described here are interconnected through dependencies in both foundational science and system-level scaling mechanisms (Exhibit 1). Their maturity varies: for example, renewable energies such as solar and wind energy are increasingly being deployed and, in some regions, are already cost competitive with fossil fuels, whereas carbon removal technologies and alternative proteins are in an early development stage.4 Renewable energies underpin many of the others but will not achieve net-zero goals on their own.\nClimate technologies have advanced rapidly, and our analysis suggests that as much as 90 percent of 2050 baseline man-made emissions could be abated with existing climate technologies.\nHowever, there is a gap between technical readiness and commercial maturity: based on our analysis, only 10 percent of abatement potential from climate technologies comes from those that are already fully commercially mature and in global deployment (Exhibit 2).7 These include nuclear, hydro, geothermal, aluminum recycling, and a share of solar and wind installations in advantaged regions with headroom in the grid. An additional 45 percent of abatement potential could come from technologies in early adoption and commercialization, including most solar and wind generation, electric vehicles, biofuels, heat pumps, and plastic chemical recycling. These technologies have already proved their ability to scale but require additional support to be competitive with incumbent technologies in the short to medium term.\nA further 40 percent of abatement potential can be attributed to technologies that are in early innovation and starting to prove their scale-up potential in demonstration projects or prototypes, but still require large-scale opportunities to validate their technological readiness and prove their commercialization potential. These include small, modular nuclear reactors; solid-state batteries; direct air capture and storage; and concrete recycling.\nClimate technologies are reaching maturity faster than in the past, and many of them\u2014especially technologically mature ones such as solar, wind, and batteries\u2014have been on impressive growth trajectories over the past decade, consistently outpacing forecasts. For example, the IEA\u2019s 2019 forecast for globally installed solar PV capacity in 2030 is more than 20 times the equivalent forecast from 2006. Exhibit 3 shows the rapid growth of solar PV, wind, and hydrogen.\nInnovations in technologies, processes, and business models contribute to this acceleration. For mature technologies, innovation focuses on accelerated deployment; for example, horizontal well drilling to increase the power capacity of geothermal plants or using robotics to accelerate solar PV installations. Less-mature climate technologies require more fundamental technological innovation to improve performance and efficiency, as well as to help bring novel solutions to market, such as DACS, Generation IV and small modular nuclear plants, or cultured proteins.\nRenewables and batteries will need to sustain their current high growth rates for 2050 climate targets to be achieved. Our analysis indicates that this would allow a more than fivefold increase in installed capacities by 2030 compared with 2021 (Exhibit 4).\nGrowth of this magnitude would be remarkably fast compared with previous changes in the energy system. For example, it took half a century for coal, crude oil, and natural gas to grow from 5 percent of global energy supply to 40 percent, 30 percent, and 20 percent of the total market, respectively.8 By contrast, if current growth rates are sustained, solar and wind would grow from around 5 percent of global energy supply in 2015 to 40 percent by 2030.\nSustaining this level of growth is bound to become more difficult for several reasons. First, our analysis shows that 80 percent of global renewables capacity was installed during a time of near-zero interest rates, and the return to higher interest rates since 2022 is al\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

A simulation is a way for us to understand something that would be difficult to experience in real life. For example, the average person isn\u2019t allowed to drive a race car. However, simulations\u2014like video games\u2014can help you experience what it would be like to zoom around a racetrack.\nA climate model is a simulation of all the factors that can affect Earth\u2019s climate. Some of these factors are things that don\u2019t really change, such as a region\u2019s distance from the shore, elevation and latitude. Some of the factors are things that do change, such as the seasons, big volcanic eruptions, air pollution or\u2014over millions of years\u2014the shifts in the continents.\nIn the real world, all of these things are connected, and in the model they are too.\nThis video uses climate model data to show a prediction of how global temperatures will change throughout this century. Credit: NASA Scientific Visualization Studio.\nClimate models work like a laboratory in a computer. They allow scientists to study how different factors interact to influence a region\u2019s climate.\nSay that a scientist wants to know what would happen if the temperature of the oceans suddenly changed. We don\u2019t have a spare Earth that we can use for experiments, so the model lets us test ideas that would be impossible or dangerous to actually do.\nIn a climate model, a scientist can change the temperature of the oceans safely inside a computer. The model then figures how lots of other things would change because of the warming oceans.\nAt the end of the calculation, the model might show, for example, that a slightly warmer ocean could cause big changes in Earth\u2019s climate. It could also show how this small change could have long-term effects. The model could help scientists understand how a change in ocean temperature affects Earth\u2019s climate 10 years from now, 100 years from now, or 1,000 years from now.\nNASA\u2019s Earth-observing satellites collect a lot of information about our planet and its atmosphere. Scientists gather information about past climates from very old trees and ice drilled from deep within glaciers. Using all of this information, scientists can understand how changes in our planet or atmosphere have affected climate over time.\nFor example, say that we know that ocean temperatures have warmed at some point in the past\u2014and we also know what effect that change had on Earth\u2019s climate. We can use that information to check if a model\u2019s predictions of similar changes in the future are accurate.\nThis satellite network measures rain and snow worldwide.\nGRACE-FO measures changes in Earth\u2019s gravity at least once every 30 days.\nThe Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2 mission measures the thickness of ice sheets and sea ice, and tree canopy heights.\nJason-3 is the fourth U.S.-European satellite mission that measures ocean-surface height.\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The National Climate Assessment finds that the number of heat waves, heavy downpours, and major hurricanes has increased in the United States, and the strength of these events has increased, too.\nA measure of the economic impact of extreme weather is the increasing number of billion-dollar disasters, which is shown below. The map shows all types of weather disasters, some of which are known to be influenced by climate change (floods, tropical storms) and some for which a climate influence is uncertain (tornadoes).\nClick on any circle to learn about one of the billion-dollar weather events, or any state to learn about billion-dollar droughts, between January 2000 and December 2024. Source: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s National Climatic Data Center. The Top 10 costliest events are listed at the bottom of this page, along with a description of major U.S. droughts since 2000.\nNOAA calculates total, direct costs \u2013 both insured and uninsured \u2013 including physical damage to residential, commercial, and government buildings, material assets within buildings, public infrastructure, vehicles and boats, offshore energy platforms, and agricultural assets, as well as business interruption losses and disaster restoration and wildfire suppression costs. These estimates do not account for losses to natural capital, health care related costs, or values associated with loss of life.\nClimate change is expected to worsen the frequency, intensity, and impacts of some types of extreme weather events. For example, sea level rise increases the impacts of coastal storms and warming can place more stress on water supplies during droughts.\nThat\u2019s why many cities, state, and businesses are taking steps to prepare for more extreme weather.\nLearn more about the links between climate change and:\nWeathering the Next Storm: A Closer Look at Business Resilience examines how companies are preparing for climate risks and what is keeping them from doing more.

These events and events influenced by climate change, such as wildfires, continue to cause significant human morbidity and mortality and adversely affect mental health and well-being. Although adverse health impacts from extreme events declined over the past few decades, climate change and more people moving into harm\u2019s way could alter this trend. Long-term changes to Earth\u2019s energy balance are increasing the frequency and intensity of many extreme events and the probability of compound events, with trends projected to accelerate under certain greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. While most of these events cannot be completely avoided, many of the health risks could be prevented through building climate-resilient health systems with improved risk reduction, preparation, response, and recovery. Conducting vulnerability and adaptation assessments and developing health system adaptation plans can identify priority actions to effectively reduce risks, such as disaster risk management and more resilient infrastructure. The risks are urgent, so action is needed now.\nKeywords: climate change, climate variability, extreme events, population health, health systems\nWorldwide, in 2019, there were 396 disasters1 that killed 11,755 people, affected 95 million others, and cost nearly US$130 billion (28). Asia was the most affected continent with 40% of the events, 45% of the deaths, and 74% of all people affected. Floods and storms accounted for 68% of the number of affected people worldwide. Anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, land use change, and other activities impacting the global energy balance are altering the frequency and intensity of many extreme weather and climate events, with some regions experiencing increases in heat waves, floods, and droughts (84). Events influenced by climate change, particularly wildfires, also are increasing.\nRisks from extreme weather and climate events arise from the intersection of the physical hazard (e.g., wind and rain), the extent of exposure to the hazard, the vulnerability of individuals and communities, and the capacity to prepare for, manage, and recover from extreme events.\nA disaster generally is defined as a sudden, calamitous event that disrupts the functioning of a community or society and that exceeds its ability to cope using its own resources (81). The occurrence of an extreme event is not required for a community or region to experience extreme impacts, such as large increase in mortality; an extreme impact can arise from a moderately strong event when it occurs in a highly vulnerable population. The converse also is true, that an extreme event may not result in extreme impacts when communities are prepared.\nRoughly 20% of disasters in 2019 occurred in North America, including the Caribbean and Central America, for total damages of US$55 billion, of which US$29 billion were insured (130). Loss events included Hurricane Dorian, which caused billions of dollars in damage, especially in the Bahamas, in late August to early September. Heavy losses that year also resulted from severe weather, floods, and a winter storm in the United States. A mixture of snowmelt triggered by unusually high temperatures in March and storms with torrential rain led to sustained and extensive flooding in Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, and Mississippi (49).\nOverall, the numbers and costs of disasters have been increasing for several decades due to increases in exposure (more people moving into harm\u2019s way and increases in the values of property and infrastructure at risk), vulnerability of people and infrastructure, and climate change (170). Since 1980, the United States has experienced 265 weather and climate disasters in which the overall damages reached or exceeded US$1 billion; the total costs were greater than US$1.775 trillion (132), with an estimated 14,223 deaths (an average of 356 per year), although the numbers of deaths are likely an underestimate (178).\nBeyond the damage to infrastructure, extreme weather events and disasters can affect the health and well-being of individuals and can have catastrophic impacts on communities and health systems. People can suffer from a wide range of physical effects (e.g., heat exhaustion, injuries in severe storms, and respiratory illnesses from molds due to floods) as well as longer-term impacts on mental health. Health systems and facilities can be affected by impacts on patients and health care staff, medical and nonmedical supplies, facility operations, and critical infrastructures. To prepare for climate change, health-sector and emergency-management officials\u2014as well as urban planners, neighborhood services staff, and others\u2014require information about how hazards are projected to change, possible future exposures of people and property, likely changes in population health and health care infrastructure vulnerabilities, and needed capacities to prepare for and manage the events and their aftermath.\nWe review (a) the current impacts and projected risks of climate change on the health of populations and health systems from extreme weather and climate events and from wildfires, (b) the value of disaster management to reduce health risks from these changes, and (c) adaptation and mitigation measures that can explicitly address climate change in policies and planning processes.\nGlobal land surface air temperature has risen 1.53\u00b0C since the preindustrial period of 1850\u20131900, with considerable variation in regional warming; this increase is much larger than the observed warming combined over land and oceans (0.87\u00b0C) (84).

The occurrence of an extreme event is not required for a community or region to experience extreme impacts, such as large increase in mortality; an extreme impact can arise from a moderately strong event when it occurs in a highly vulnerable population. The converse also is true, that an extreme event may not result in extreme impacts when communities are prepared.\nRoughly 20% of disasters in 2019 occurred in North America, including the Caribbean and Central America, for total damages of US$55 billion, of which US$29 billion were insured (130). Loss events included Hurricane Dorian, which caused billions of dollars in damage, especially in the Bahamas, in late August to early September. Heavy losses that year also resulted from severe weather, floods, and a winter storm in the United States. A mixture of snowmelt triggered by unusually high temperatures in March and storms with torrential rain led to sustained and extensive flooding in Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, and Mississippi (49).\nOverall, the numbers and costs of disasters have been increasing for several decades due to increases in exposure (more people moving into harm\u2019s way and increases in the values of property and infrastructure at risk), vulnerability of people and infrastructure, and climate change (170). Since 1980, the United States has experienced 265 weather and climate disasters in which the overall damages reached or exceeded US$1 billion; the total costs were greater than US$1.775 trillion (132), with an estimated 14,223 deaths (an average of 356 per year), although the numbers of deaths are likely an underestimate (178).\nBeyond the damage to infrastructure, extreme weather events and disasters can affect the health and well-being of individuals and can have catastrophic impacts on communities and health systems. People can suffer from a wide range of physical effects (e.g., heat exhaustion, injuries in severe storms, and respiratory illnesses from molds due to floods) as well as longer-term impacts on mental health. Health systems and facilities can be affected by impacts on patients and health care staff, medical and nonmedical supplies, facility operations, and critical infrastructures. To prepare for climate change, health-sector and emergency-management officials\u2014as well as urban planners, neighborhood services staff, and others\u2014require information about how hazards are projected to change, possible future exposures of people and property, likely changes in population health and health care infrastructure vulnerabilities, and needed capacities to prepare for and manage the events and their aftermath.\nWe review (a) the current impacts and projected risks of climate change on the health of populations and health systems from extreme weather and climate events and from wildfires, (b) the value of disaster management to reduce health risks from these changes, and (c) adaptation and mitigation measures that can explicitly address climate change in policies and planning processes.\nGlobal land surface air temperature has risen 1.53\u00b0C since the preindustrial period of 1850\u20131900, with considerable variation in regional warming; this increase is much larger than the observed warming combined over land and oceans (0.87\u00b0C) (84).

At the same time, these areas are constantly evolving and face a wide range of natural and human-induced stresses, including erosion, storms, and pressures from development and recreational uses.\nCurrent scientific research shows that climate change will lead to substantial sea-level rise along much of the U.S. coastline. Sea levels have already risen between 10 and 25 cm over the last century. Global warming will accelerate these rates, with sea levels projected to rise by 50 cm by 2100.\n\u201cSea-Level Rise and Global Climate Change\u201d is the fourth in a series of reports examining the potential impacts of climate change on the U.S. environment and society. This report finds that the vulnerability of a coastal area to sea-level rise varies according to the physical characteristics of the coastline, the population size and amount of development, and the responsiveness of land-use and infrastructure planning at the local level. The authors conclude the following:\nDamages and economic losses could be reduced if local decision-makers understand the potential impacts of sea-level rise and use this information for planning.\nThe authors and the Pew Center gratefully acknowledge Dr. Donald Boesch and Dr. George Parsons for their review of previous drafts of this report. In addition, the Pew Center would like to thank Joel Smith and Brian Hurd of Stratus Consulting for their management and oversight of this Environmental Impacts Series.\nClimate change is likely to accelerate the historical rise in sea level through warming of oceans and melting of ice, which in turn will affect coastal development, wetland resources, and recreation along the U.S. coast. The impacts of sea-level rise will occur in coastal areas that are continually evolving and already face a wide range of natural and human-induced stresses, including erosion, storms, land subsidence, wetland loss, and environmental degradation from recreation and development pressures. Responses to sea-level rise at the national, state, and local level must therefore reflect an understanding of the complex interactions of human and ecological systems in coastal areas. In this report, we review the state of understanding of the impacts of sea-level rise on U.S. coasts.\nImpact assessment for sea-level rise requires careful assessment of local conditions, the magnitude and uncertainties of global sea-level rise, and the costs and feasibility of response options. Important local conditions include coastal topography, geology, and economic and demographic factors. The areas in the United States most vulnerable to sea-level rise are in the mid-Atlantic and south-Atlantic states (because of their low-lying topography, high economic value, and relatively high storm frequency) and along the Gulf Coast (because of low-lying topography and rapid land subsidence). Parts of New England are also at risk, particularly coastal islands in southern New England. The West Coast is generally at lower risk, with the exception of San Francisco Bay and Puget Sound.\nExisting threats to coasts that may be increased by climate change include: gradual sea-level rise, catastrophic sea-level rise (i.e., Antarctic ice sheet melt), and changes in storm frequency or intensity. Impact assessments have focused on the first threat, with some consideration in recent studies of the effect of storms on development and redevelopment patterns in the coastal zone. Although evidence of Antarctic ice sheet melt exists in the geologic record, recent evaluations suggest the probability of this event occurring in the next century is very low. Research on the effects of climate change on storm frequency and intensity is active, but currently inconclusive.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concludes that increases in global temperatures over the next century could accelerate the historical rate of global mean sea-level rise from 1 to 2.5 millimeters per year to about 5 mm/yr (50 cm/century), with an uncertainty range of 2 to 9 mm/yr (IPCC, 1996a). More recent work using new greenhouse gas emissions scenarios shows a slightly higher rate of sea-level rise (Wigley, 1999).\nThe impacts of sea-level rise will vary by location and depend on a range of biophysical characteristics and socioeconomic factors, including human response. The primary impacts of sea-level rise are physical changes to the environment. These changes, in turn, affect human uses of the coast such as tourism, settlement, shipping, commercial and recreational fishing, agriculture, and wildlife viewing. The most serious physical impacts of gradual sea-level rise on coastal lowlands are (1) inundation and displacement of wetlands and lowlands; (2) coastal erosion; (3) increased vulnerability to coastal storm damage and flooding; and (4) salinization of surface water and groundwater.\nNational assessments suggest that a one-meter rise in global sea levels could have significant impacts, including the inundation of about 35,000 square kilometers (km2) (13,000 square miles (mi2)) of land, divided about equally between wetlands and upland. In addition, the 100-year coastal flood plain could increase by 38 percent, or at least 18,000 km 2 (7,000 mi2). Estimates of land inundated if global sea levels rise 0.5 meter are closer to 24,000 km 2 (9,000 mi2). Major coastal cities such as New Orleans, Miami, New York, and Washington, DC, will have to upgrade flood defenses and drainage systems or risk adverse consequences.\nThree options have been proposed to respond to coastal threats: planned retreat, accommodation, and protection. Impact and adaptation assessments evaluate where these responses might be implemented and then calculate the costs of implementation and the damages to resources that are not protected.

The impacts of sea-level rise will occur in coastal areas that are continually evolving and already face a wide range of natural and human-induced stresses, including erosion, storms, land subsidence, wetland loss, and environmental degradation from recreation and development pressures.

In this report, we review the state of understanding of the impacts of sea-level rise on U.S. coasts.\nImpact assessment for sea-level rise requires careful assessment of local conditions, the magnitude and uncertainties of global sea-level rise, and the costs and feasibility of response options.
