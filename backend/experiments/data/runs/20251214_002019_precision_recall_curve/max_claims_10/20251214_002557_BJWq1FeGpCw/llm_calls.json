    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nWhat if I told you that someone had developed an energy source that could help us solve our biggest environmental challenges, purify our water and air, make our cities and homes more sanitary, and keep us safe from potential catastrophic climate change? What if I also told you that this energy source was cheap, plentiful, and reliable? Well, there is such a source. You probably know it as fossil fuel. Oil. Natural gas. Coal. But wait? Don\u2019t fossil fuels pollute our environment and make our climate unlivable? That, of course, is what we\u2019re told\u2026and what our children are taught. But let\u2019s look at the data. Here\u2019s a graph you\u2019ve probably never seen: the correlation between use of fossil fuels and access to clean water. More fossil fuel. More clean water. Am I saying the more we that we have used fossil fuel, the cleaner our water has become? Yes, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying. In the developed world, we take clean water for granted. We turn on a tap and it\u2019s there. But getting it there takes a massive amount of energy. Think of the man-made reservoirs, the purification plants, the network of pipes. In the undeveloped world, it\u2019s a much different story. They lack the energy, so they lack clean water. More fossil fuel. More clean water. The same is true of sanitation. By the use of cheap, plentiful, and reliable energy from fossil fuels, we have made our environment cleaner. Take a look at this graph. More fossil fuel. Better sanitation. Okay, what about air quality? Here\u2019s a graph of the air pollution trends in the United States over the last half century based on data from the Environmental Protection Agency. Note the dramatic downward trend in emissions, even though we use more fossil fuel than ever. How was this achieved? Above all, by using anti-pollution technology powered by\u2026 fossil fuel: oil, natural gas and coal. But even without modern pollution control technology, fossil fuel makes our air cleaner. Indoor pollution\u2014caused by burning a fire inside your house, cabin, hut or tent to cook and keep warm\u2014was a deadly global problem until the late 19th century when cheap kerosene, a fossil fuel byproduct, became available in America and Europe. Indoor pollution is still a major issue in the developing world today. The best solution? Fossil fuel. And now we come to the biggest fossil fuel concern of all\u2014global warming. On this very sensitive topic we need to get our terms straight: There is a big difference between mild global warming and catastrophic global warming. We can all agree on that, right? The issue isn\u2019t: does burning fossil fuel have some warming impact? It does. The issue is: is the climate warming dangerously fast? In 1986 NASA climate scientist James Hansen\u2014one of the world\u2019s most prominent critics of the use of fossil fuels\u2014predicted that \u201cif current trends are unchanged,\u201d temperatures would rise 2 to 4 degrees in the first decade of the 2000s. But as you can see from this graph, since 2000 the trend line is essentially flat\u2014little or no warming in the last 15 years. That\u2019s probably why we hear much less talk about \u201cglobal warming\u201d and much more talk about \u201cclimate change.\u201d Has this \u201cclimate change\u201d made our world more dangerous? The key statistic here, one that is, unfortunately, almost never mentioned, is \u201cclimate-related deaths,\u201d that is, how many people die each year from a climate-related cause, including droughts, floods, storms, and extreme temperatures. In the last eighty years, as CO2 emissions have rapidly escalated, the annual rate of climate-related deaths worldwide has rapidly declined -- by 98%. The reason is that the energy from fossil fuel has allowed the developed world to build a durable civilization, one highly resilient to extreme heat, extreme cold, floods, storms, and so on. The developing world\u2014where natural disasters can still wreak terrible havoc\u2014 would like the chance to do the same. But to do that they will need a lot more energy. The cheapest, fastest and easiest way to get that energy is from fossil fuels. In sum, fossil fuels don\u2019t take a naturally safe environment and make it dangerous; they empower us to take a naturally dangerous environment and make it cleaner and safer.

This research paper investigates into the vital role of renewable energy in addressing Jordan\u2019s water woes and proposes a sustainable path for the future. Through a comprehensive case study, integrating renewable energy and water desalination in arid regions represents a promising pathway for sustainable water management and environmental conservation. By harnessing abundant renewable resources, arid regions can address their pressing water needs, mitigate climate change, and reduce dependence on non-renewable energy sources. Overcoming economic barriers and optimizing technology will be crucial in fully unlocking the potential of this innovative approach for a water-secure and environmentally conscious future.\nGlobal water scarcity has far-reaching consequences, affecting developed and developing nations. This pressing issue jeopardizes human rights and threatens economic growth and social stability (Mishra & Tushaus, 2022; Shemer et al., 2023). Climate change acts as a compounding factor, intensifying the challenges associated with water scarcity. The increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events, alterations in the water cycle, and depletion of water resources contribute to the growing crisis (Mahato et al., 2022). Importantly, water scarcity extends beyond a mere quantity problem and manifests as a quality issue. Polluted return flows further degrade water quality, exacerbating the overall problem (Guarino, 2017). This dual challenge of quantity and quality has profound implications for public health. The lack of access to clean water sources results in severe health issues, with contaminated drinking water causing diseases such as diarrhea, leading to significant mortality rates (Van Vliet et al., 2021).\nAddressing water scarcity demands a multifaceted approach. Utilizing alternative water sources, such as desalination and wastewater reclamation, is crucial. Additionally, improving water catchment and harvesting technologies can enhance water availability. Pollution control measures are essential to safeguard water quality. Implementing these actions necessitates coordinated efforts, including centralized governance, educational campaigns, infrastructure development, and transboundary water cooperation. Desalination and wastewater reclamation technologies offer promising solutions by tapping into non-traditional water sources. Advancements in these technologies can provide a sustainable means of meeting water demand in water-scarce regions. Simultaneously, improving water catchment and harvesting technologies helps maximize the efficient use of available water resources.\nCrucially, pollution control measures play a pivotal role in preserving water quality. Mitigating industrial, agricultural, and domestic pollution helps prevent further degradation of water sources. Centralized governance is essential for formulating and enforcing regulations to control pollution effectively. Educational campaigns are vital components of any strategy to address water scarcity. Raising awareness about responsible water usage, conservation practices, and the importance of pollution prevention fosters a collective sense of responsibility. Infrastructure development, including establishing water treatment facilities and distribution networks, ensures reliable access to clean water.\nMoreover, addressing water scarcity often requires collaboration across borders. Transboundary water cooperation is essential, especially in regions where water resources span multiple countries. Joint efforts can lead to more effective and sustainable water management practices, benefiting all involved nations.\nPotential solutions to global water scarcity include infrastructure investment, expansion of clean water technologies such as desalination and treated wastewater reuse, and the application Of Adaptive Inner-Basin Water Allocation Measures (AIWAM) (He et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2021). Infrastructure investment can help relieve water scarcity in more than two-thirds of water-scarce cities, but environmental trade-offs must be considered (Salehi, 2022). Expanding desalination and treated wastewater can significantly reduce water scarcity levels and the number of people affected, especially in Asia. However, side effects such as brine and energy demand must be considered (Endo et al., 2018). Applying AIWAM can mitigate water scarcity for nonagricultural sectors but may increase water scarcity for agriculture in upstream areas. These potential solutions provide useful information for developing adaptation strategies toward sustainable water management.\nMitigating global water scarcity necessitates a holistic approach encompassing technological innovations, regulatory frameworks, educational initiatives, and international cooperation. By implementing a comprehensive strategy, the world can ensure equitable access to clean water, promote sustainable development, and safeguard communities\u2019 well-being worldwide. A comprehensive understanding of global water scarcity involves recognizing the interconnected nature of water quantity and quality, understanding the dynamic changes in terrestrial water storage, acknowledging historical trends, addressing monthly water scarcity challenges, and grappling with the consequences of increased water consumption over the 20th century. Addressing these aspects collectively is essential for formulating effective and sustainable water management strategies globally.\nWater scarcity is a complex and widespread global challenge arising from both insufficient water quantity and compromised water quality.

In the image, ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nBerkeley Earth, a California-based non-profit research organization, has been preparing independent analyses of global mean temperature changes since 2013. The following is our report on global mean temperature during 2023.\nWe conclude that 2023 was the warmest year on Earth since 1850, exceeding the previous record set in 2016 by a clear and definitive margin.\nThe global annual average for 2023 in our dataset was estimated as 1.54 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b0C (2.77 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b0F) above the average during the period 1850 to 1900, which is traditionally used a reference for the preindustrial period. This is the first time that any year has exceeded the key 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) threshold. The significance of this is discussed below. Also, please note that given the uncertainties and differences in methodologies, other groups are expected to report 2023 as slightly less than 1.5 \u00b0C above preindustrial. The differences between Berkeley Earth\u2019s analysis and that of other groups is discussed at the end of this report.\nThe last nine years have included all nine of the warmest years observed in the instrumental record.\nThe long-term trend towards higher temperatures is being driven by man-made global warming. However, year-to-year rankings are likely to reflect short-term natural variability. In 2023, an emerging El Ni\u00f1o event combined with other natural and man-made factors discussed below to create a record-breaking warm year. By contrast, 2021 and 2022 had somewhat lower temperatures due to a persistent a La Ni\u00f1a event. The cyclic warming and cooling due to El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a is one of the largest sources of year-to-year internal variability in the global average temperature, often adding or subtracting 0.1 \u00b0C from the global average.\n2023 was a highly unusual year in several respects, including record warmth in most ocean basins and a large deviation from the historical trend. Warmth in 2023 greatly exceeded expectations, and was much stronger than normal this early in an El Ni\u00f1o. Some studies have recently argued that the pace of global warming may be accelerating, and some of the evidence for this is discussed below. However, given historical variability in surface temperatures, it still remains too early to conclude whether or not the pace of surface warming has increased.\nDuring 2023, 17% of the Earth\u2019s surface had a locally record warm annual average. By chance, these areas coincided with a number of major population centers. We estimate that 2.3 billion people \u2014 29% of Earth\u2019s population \u2014 experienced a locally record warm annual average in 2023. This includes half the population of China, and a majority of the populations of Bangladesh, Japan, Mexico, as well as much of South and Central America.\nNone of the Earth\u2019s surface had a record cold annual average in 2023.\nAs discussed below, we believe there are slightly better than even odds that 2024 will be warmer than 2023.\nIn addition, 2023 was notable for:\nIn Berkeley Earth\u2019s analysis the global mean temperature in 2023 is estimated to have been 1.54 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b0C (2.77 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b0F) above the average temperature from 1850-1900, a period often used as a pre-industrial baseline for global temperature targets. This is ~0.17 \u00b0C (~0.30 \u00b0F) warmer than the previous record high observed in 2016. As a result, 2023 is the warmest year to have been directly observed using thermometer measurements, and stands out well-above all previous years.\nThis is the first time that an annual average temperature has exceeded the pre-industrial baseline period by more than 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F).\nUnder the Paris Agreement, many countries have set an aspirational goal of limiting long-term global warming to no more than 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F). That target is based on the state of the climate averaged over many years, so it is not automatically considered to have been breached by a single year exceeding 1.5 \u00b0C of warming. However, a single year exceeding 1.5 \u00b0C is a stark warning sign of how close the overall climate system has come to exceeding this Paris Agreement goal. With greenhouse gas emissions continuing to set record highs, it is likely that climate will regularly exceed 1.5 \u00b0C in the next decade.\nThe last nine years stand out as the nine warmest years to have been directly observed.\nThe temperature uncertainties can be visualized using the schematic below where each year\u2019s temperature estimate is represented by a distribution reflecting its uncertainty. In the analysis that Berkeley Earth conducts, the uncertainty on the mean temperature of a single year is approximately 0.03 \u00b0C (0.05 \u00b0F) for recent years. The global mean temperature in 2023 lies far above the previous record high set in 2016 and all other years.\nThe last nine years have been part of a period of significant warmth well above all previous years since 1850. This reflects the long-term trend towards man-made global warming.\nIn 2023, the monthly-average temperature in January was similar to that in 2021 or 2022, but well below the previous record level. However, following the end of La Ni\u00f1a in the Pacific, record-breaking monthly-average warmth began in June and continued in every month through the rest of the year, often beating the previous monthly record by a large margin. September had the largest monthly anomaly ever observed, with December coming in as the second largest. Seven months in 2023 were at least 1.5 \u00b0C / 2.7 \u00b0F above their corresponding 1850-1900 average.\nOn land, 2023 was also the warmest year directly observed, reaching 2.10 \u00b0C / 3.78 \u00b0F above the 1850 to 1900 average. This is the first year with a land-average of more than 2.0 \u00b0C, and beats the previous record set in 2020 by 0.13 \u00b0C / 0.23 \u00b0F.\nAs discussed below, many territories saw local record warm annual averages in 2023.\nOn the ocean\u2019s surface, 2023 was also the warmest year directly observed, reaching 1.10 \u00b0C / 1.98 \u00b0F. This is the first year with a ocean-average above 1.0 \u00b0C, and beats the previous record set in 2020 by a very large maring, 0.16 \u00b0C / 0.29 \u00b0F\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

These costs are known as externalities. Each stage of the fossil fuel supply chain, from extraction and transportation to refining and burning, generates externalities. This fact sheet provides a survey of some of the externalities associated with fossil fuels.\nWhen fossil fuels are burned, they emit greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide that trap heat in the earth\u2019s atmosphere and contribute to climate change. In 2019, fossil fuels accounted for 74 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Nearly 25 percent of emissions in the United States come from fossil fuels extracted from public lands. Some of the climate externalities of fossil fuels include:\nFossil fuels have significant environmental externalities including:\nAir pollution from burning fossil fuels can cause multiple health issues, including asthma, cancer, heart disease, and premature death. Combusting the additives found in gasoline\u2014benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene\u2014produces cancer-causing ultra-fine particles and aromatic hydrocarbons. Globally, fossil fuel pollution is responsible for one in five deaths. In the United States, 350,000 premature deaths in 2018 were attributed to fossil fuel-related pollution, with the highest number of deaths per capita in states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia. The annual cost of the health impacts of fossil fuel-generated electricity in the United States is estimated to be up to $886.5 billion.\nThe environmental and health impacts of fossil fuels disproportionately harm communities of color and low-income communities. Black and Hispanic Americans are exposed to 56 and 63 percent more particulate matter pollution, respectively, than they produce. In a predominantly Black and low-income area of Louisiana known as \u201cCancer Alley,\u201d the cancer risk is nearly 50 times higher than the national average due to 150 nearby chemical plants and oil refineries.\nSeveral policy mechanisms have been proposed to reduce fossil fuel externalities, including:\nAuthor: Savannah Bertrand\nEditor: Anna McGinn\nGraphic: Emma Johnson\nFor the endnotes, please download the PDF version of this issue brief.\nEESI RSS Feed\n1020 19th Street, NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20036-6101\n(202) 628-1400 phone (202) 204-5244 fax\ninfo@eesi.org Staff directory EIN: 52-1268030\nEESI advances science-based solutions for climate change, energy, and environmental challenges in order to achieve our vision of a sustainable, resilient, and equitable world.\nMore about EESI\nCopyright \u00a9 Environmental and Energy Study Institute (EESI).

Fracking, a method used to extract natural gas, has been linked to groundwater pollution.\n\nFull Page Content:\nEnergy is at the heart of the climate challenge \u2013 and key to the solution.\nMost of the greenhouse gases that trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere come from burning fossil fuels to produce energy, mainly for electricity and heat. In 2023, the power sector was the largest source of global greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe science is clear: to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, emissions must be reduced by almost half by 2030, and reach net-zero by 2050.\nTo achieve this, we need to end our reliance on fossil fuels and invest in alternative sources of energy that are clean, accessible, affordable, sustainable, and reliable.\nRenewable energy sources \u2014 such as sunlight, wind, water, organic waste, and heat from the Earth \u2014 are abundant, replenished by nature, and emit little to no greenhouse gases or air pollutants.\nFossil fuels still account for nearly 60 per cent of electricity generation, but cleaner sources of energy are gaining ground. Between 2015 and 2024, annual electricity capacity of renewables increased by around 2,600 gigawatts (GW) - a 140 per cent increase. In the same period, fossil fuels electricity capacity only increased by around 640 GW (16 per cent).\nHere are five reasons why accelerating the transition to clean energy is the pathway to a healthy, livable planet today and for generations to come.\nAbout 80 per cent of the global population lives in countries that are net-importers of fossil fuels - that\u2019s about 6 billion people who are dependent on fossil fuels from other countries, which makes them vulnerable to geopolitical shocks and crises.\nIn contrast, renewable energy sources are available in all countries, and their potential is yet to be fully harnessed. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimates that 90 percent of the world\u2019s electricity can and should come from renewable energy by 2050.\nRenewables offer a way out of import dependency, allowing countries to diversify their economies and protect them from the unpredictable price swings of fossil fuels, while driving inclusive economic growth, new jobs, and poverty alleviation.\nToday, renewable energy is the most affordable source of power in most parts of the world.\nPrices for renewable energy technologies are dropping rapidly. Over 90 per cent of new renewable projects are now cheaper than fossil fuels alternatives. At the same time, solar and offshore wind are now respectively 41 per cent and 53 per cent cheaper than fossil fuels.\nDeclining prices are making renewable energy more attractive worldwide \u2013 including to low- and middle-income countries, where most of the future demand for new electricity will arise. This creates a real opportunity for much of the new power supply over the coming years to come from low-carbon sources. By 2040, for instance, Africa could generate 10 times more electricity than it needs \u2013 entirely from renewables.\nRenewable energy can also help meet new electricity demand, particularly for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and data centres. A typical AI data centre eats up as much electricity as 100,000 homes. Every major tech firm should switch to 100 per cent renewables to power data centres by 2030.\nCheap electricity from renewable sources could provide 65 per cent of the world\u2019s total electricity supply by 2030. It could decarbonize 90 per cent of the power sector by 2050, massively cutting carbon emissions and helping to mitigate climate change.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), about 99 percent of people in the world breathe air that exceeds air quality limits and threatens their health. Air pollution is associated with 7 million premature deaths every year.\nThe unhealthy levels of fine particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide originate mainly from the burning of fossil fuels. The economic health damage caused by air pollution amounts to $8.1 trillion a year, equivalent to 6.1 per cent of global GDP.\nSwitching to clean sources of energy, such as wind and solar, helps address not only climate change but also air pollution and health.\nClean energy sector jobs already outnumber fossil fuel jobs \u2013 employing almost 35 million people worldwide. In 2023, 16.2 million people were employed in the renewable energy sector, up from 13.7 million in 2022.\nFor every dollar invested, renewable energy creates three times as many jobs as the fossil fuel industry. The IEA estimates that the transition towards net-zero emissions will lead to an overall increase in energy sector jobs: while about 5 million jobs in fossil fuel production could be lost by 2030, an estimated 14 million new jobs would be created in clean energy, resulting in a net gain of 9 million jobs.\nIn addition, energy-related industries will need 16 million more workers, for instance to take on new roles manufacturing electric vehicles and hyper-efficient appliances, or in innovative technologies such as hydrogen economy. This means that a total of more than 30 million jobs could be created in clean energy, efficiency, and low-emissions technologies by 2030.\nEnsuring a just transition, placing the needs and rights of people at the heart of the energy transition, will be paramount to make sure no one is left behind.\nIn 2024, $2 trillion went into clean energy \u2013 $800 billion more than fossil fuels and up almost 70 per cent in ten years. In 2023 alone, clean energy sectors drove 10 per cent of global GDP growth.\nFurthermore, energy-related carbon dioxide emissions are growing more slowly than the global economy. Emissions growth slowed to 0.8 per cent in 2024, while the global economy expanded by more than 3 per cent.\nYet, the fossil fuel industry continues to be heavily subsidized. About $7 trillion was spent on fossil fuels in 2022, including through explicit subsidies, tax breaks, and health and environmental damages that were not priced into the cost of fossil fuels.\nIn comparison, about $4.5 trillion a year needs to be invested in renewable energy until 2030 \u2013 including investments in technology and infr\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

With one of the world\u2019s lowest per capita freshwater availability, Jordan\u2019s growing population and limited resources create a dangerous balance. This research paper investigates into the vital role of renewable energy in addressing Jordan\u2019s water woes and proposes a sustainable path for the future. Through a comprehensive case study, integrating renewable energy and water desalination in arid regions represents a promising pathway for sustainable water management and environmental conservation. By harnessing abundant renewable resources, arid regions can address their pressing water needs, mitigate climate change, and reduce dependence on non-renewable energy sources. Overcoming economic barriers and optimizing technology will be crucial in fully unlocking the potential of this innovative approach for a water-secure and environmentally conscious future.\nGlobal water scarcity has far-reaching consequences, affecting developed and developing nations. This pressing issue jeopardizes human rights and threatens economic growth and social stability (Mishra & Tushaus, 2022; Shemer et al., 2023). Climate change acts as a compounding factor, intensifying the challenges associated with water scarcity. The increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events, alterations in the water cycle, and depletion of water resources contribute to the growing crisis (Mahato et al., 2022). Importantly, water scarcity extends beyond a mere quantity problem and manifests as a quality issue. Polluted return flows further degrade water quality, exacerbating the overall problem (Guarino, 2017). This dual challenge of quantity and quality has profound implications for public health. The lack of access to clean water sources results in severe health issues, with contaminated drinking water causing diseases such as diarrhea, leading to significant mortality rates (Van Vliet et al., 2021).\nAddressing water scarcity demands a multifaceted approach. Utilizing alternative water sources, such as desalination and wastewater reclamation, is crucial. Additionally, improving water catchment and harvesting technologies can enhance water availability. Pollution control measures are essential to safeguard water quality. Implementing these actions necessitates coordinated efforts, including centralized governance, educational campaigns, infrastructure development, and transboundary water cooperation. Desalination and wastewater reclamation technologies offer promising solutions by tapping into non-traditional water sources. Advancements in these technologies can provide a sustainable means of meeting water demand in water-scarce regions. Simultaneously, improving water catchment and harvesting technologies helps maximize the efficient use of available water resources.\nCrucially, pollution control measures play a pivotal role in preserving water quality. Mitigating industrial, agricultural, and domestic pollution helps prevent further degradation of water sources. Centralized governance is essential for formulating and enforcing regulations to control pollution effectively. Educational campaigns are vital components of any strategy to address water scarcity. Raising awareness about responsible water usage, conservation practices, and the importance of pollution prevention fosters a collective sense of responsibility. Infrastructure development, including establishing water treatment facilities and distribution networks, ensures reliable access to clean water.\nMoreover, addressing water scarcity often requires collaboration across borders. Transboundary water cooperation is essential, especially in regions where water resources span multiple countries. Joint efforts can lead to more effective and sustainable water management practices, benefiting all involved nations.\nPotential solutions to global water scarcity include infrastructure investment, expansion of clean water technologies such as desalination and treated wastewater reuse, and the application Of Adaptive Inner-Basin Water Allocation Measures (AIWAM) (He et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2021). Infrastructure investment can help relieve water scarcity in more than two-thirds of water-scarce cities, but environmental trade-offs must be considered (Salehi, 2022). Expanding desalination and treated wastewater can significantly reduce water scarcity levels and the number of people affected, especially in Asia. However, side effects such as brine and energy demand must be considered (Endo et al., 2018). Applying AIWAM can mitigate water scarcity for nonagricultural sectors but may increase water scarcity for agriculture in upstream areas. These potential solutions provide useful information for developing adaptation strategies toward sustainable water management.\nMitigating global water scarcity necessitates a holistic approach encompassing technological innovations, regulatory frameworks, educational initiatives, and international cooperation. By implementing a comprehensive strategy, the world can ensure equitable access to clean water, promote sustainable development, and safeguard communities\u2019 well-being worldwide. A comprehensive understanding of global water scarcity involves recognizing the interconnected nature of water quantity and quality, understanding the dynamic changes in terrestrial water storage, acknowledging historical trends, addressing monthly water scarcity challenges, and grappling with the consequences of increased water consumption over the 20th century.

The following is our report on global mean temperature during 2023.\nWe conclude that 2023 was the warmest year on Earth since 1850, exceeding the previous record set in 2016 by a clear and definitive margin.\nThe global annual average for 2023 in our dataset was estimated as 1.54 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b0C (2.77 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b0F) above the average during the period 1850 to 1900, which is traditionally used a reference for the preindustrial period. This is the first time that any year has exceeded the key 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) threshold. The significance of this is discussed below. Also, please note that given the uncertainties and differences in methodologies, other groups are expected to report 2023 as slightly less than 1.5 \u00b0C above preindustrial. The differences between Berkeley Earth\u2019s analysis and that of other groups is discussed at the end of this report.\nThe last nine years have included all nine of the warmest years observed in the instrumental record.\nThe long-term trend towards higher temperatures is being driven by man-made global warming. However, year-to-year rankings are likely to reflect short-term natural variability. In 2023, an emerging El Ni\u00f1o event combined with other natural and man-made factors discussed below to create a record-breaking warm year. By contrast, 2021 and 2022 had somewhat lower temperatures due to a persistent a La Ni\u00f1a event. The cyclic warming and cooling due to El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a is one of the largest sources of year-to-year internal variability in the global average temperature, often adding or subtracting 0.1 \u00b0C from the global average.\n2023 was a highly unusual year in several respects, including record warmth in most ocean basins and a large deviation from the historical trend. Warmth in 2023 greatly exceeded expectations, and was much stronger than normal this early in an El Ni\u00f1o. Some studies have recently argued that the pace of global warming may be accelerating, and some of the evidence for this is discussed below. However, given historical variability in surface temperatures, it still remains too early to conclude whether or not the pace of surface warming has increased.\nDuring 2023, 17% of the Earth\u2019s surface had a locally record warm annual average. By chance, these areas coincided with a number of major population centers. We estimate that 2.3 billion people \u2014 29% of Earth\u2019s population \u2014 experienced a locally record warm annual average in 2023. This includes half the population of China, and a majority of the populations of Bangladesh, Japan, Mexico, as well as much of South and Central America.\nNone of the Earth\u2019s surface had a record cold annual average in 2023.\nAs discussed below, we believe there are slightly better than even odds that 2024 will be warmer than 2023.\nIn addition, 2023 was notable for:\nIn Berkeley Earth\u2019s analysis the global mean temperature in 2023 is estimated to have been 1.54 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b0C (2.77 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b0F) above the average temperature from 1850-1900, a period often used as a pre-industrial baseline for global temperature targets. This is ~0.17 \u00b0C (~0.30 \u00b0F) warmer than the previous record high observed in 2016. As a result, 2023 is the warmest year to have been directly observed using thermometer measurements, and stands out well-above all previous years.\nThis is the first time that an annual average temperature has exceeded the pre-industrial baseline period by more than 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F).\nUnder the Paris Agreement, many countries have set an aspirational goal of limiting long-term global warming to no more than 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F). That target is based on the state of the climate averaged over many years, so it is not automatically considered to have been breached by a single year exceeding 1.5 \u00b0C of warming. However, a single year exceeding 1.5 \u00b0C is a stark warning sign of how close the overall climate system has come to exceeding this Paris Agreement goal. With greenhouse gas emissions continuing to set record highs, it is likely that climate will regularly exceed 1.5 \u00b0C in the next decade.\nThe last nine years stand out as the nine warmest years to have been directly observed.\nThe temperature uncertainties can be visualized using the schematic below where each year\u2019s temperature estimate is represented by a distribution reflecting its uncertainty. In the analysis that Berkeley Earth conducts, the uncertainty on the mean temperature of a single year is approximately 0.03 \u00b0C (0.05 \u00b0F) for recent years. The global mean temperature in 2023 lies far above the previous record high set in 2016 and all other years.\nThe last nine years have been part of a period of significant warmth well above all previous years since 1850. This reflects the long-term trend towards man-made global warming.\nIn 2023, the monthly-average temperature in January was similar to that in 2021 or 2022, but well below the previous record level. However, following the end of La Ni\u00f1a in the Pacific, record-breaking monthly-average warmth began in June and continued in every month through the rest of the year, often beating the previous monthly record by a large margin. September had the largest monthly anomaly ever observed, with December coming in as the second largest. Seven months in 2023 were at least 1.5 \u00b0C / 2.7 \u00b0F above their corresponding 1850-1900 average.\nOn land, 2023 was also the warmest year directly observed, reaching 2.10 \u00b0C / 3.78 \u00b0F above the 1850 to 1900 average. This is the first year with a land-average of more than 2.0 \u00b0C, and beats the previous record set in 2020 by 0.13 \u00b0C / 0.23 \u00b0F.\nAs discussed below, many territories saw local record warm annual averages in 2023.\nOn the ocean\u2019s surface, 2023 was also the warmest year directly observed, reaching 1.10 \u00b0C / 1.98 \u00b0F. This is the first year with a ocean-average above 1.0 \u00b0C, and beats the previous record set in 2020 by a very large maring, 0.16 \u00b0C / 0.29 \u00b0F\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This includes half the population of China, and a majority of the populations of Bangladesh, Japan, Mexico, as well as much of South and Central America.\nNone of the Earth\u2019s surface had a record cold annual average in 2023.\nAs discussed below, we believe there are slightly better than even odds that 2024 will be warmer than 2023.\nIn addition, 2023 was notable for:\nIn Berkeley Earth\u2019s analysis the global mean temperature in 2023 is estimated to have been 1.54 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b0C (2.77 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b0F) above the average temperature from 1850-1900, a period often used as a pre-industrial baseline for global temperature targets. This is ~0.17 \u00b0C (~0.30 \u00b0F) warmer than the previous record high observed in 2016. As a result, 2023 is the warmest year to have been directly observed using thermometer measurements, and stands out well-above all previous years.\nThis is the first time that an annual average temperature has exceeded the pre-industrial baseline period by more than 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F).\nUnder the Paris Agreement, many countries have set an aspirational goal of limiting long-term global warming to no more than 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F). That target is based on the state of the climate averaged over many years, so it is not automatically considered to have been breached by a single year exceeding 1.5 \u00b0C of warming. However, a single year exceeding 1.5 \u00b0C is a stark warning sign of how close the overall climate system has come to exceeding this Paris Agreement goal. With greenhouse gas emissions continuing to set record highs, it is likely that climate will regularly exceed 1.5 \u00b0C in the next decade.\nThe last nine years stand out as the nine warmest years to have been directly observed.\nThe temperature uncertainties can be visualized using the schematic below where each year\u2019s temperature estimate is represented by a distribution reflecting its uncertainty. In the analysis that Berkeley Earth conducts, the uncertainty on the mean temperature of a single year is approximately 0.03 \u00b0C (0.05 \u00b0F) for recent years. The global mean temperature in 2023 lies far above the previous record high set in 2016 and all other years.\nThe last nine years have been part of a period of significant warmth well above all previous years since 1850. This reflects the long-term trend towards man-made global warming.\nIn 2023, the monthly-average temperature in January was similar to that in 2021 or 2022, but well below the previous record level. However, following the end of La Ni\u00f1a in the Pacific, record-breaking monthly-average warmth began in June and continued in every month through the rest of the year, often beating the previous monthly record by a large margin. September had the largest monthly anomaly ever observed, with December coming in as the second largest.

By continuing ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nBerkeley Earth, a California-based non-profit research organization, has been preparing independent analyses of global mean temperature changes since 2013. The following is our report on global mean temperature during 2023.\nWe conclude that 2023 was the warmest year on Earth since 1850, exceeding the previous record set in 2016 by a clear and definitive margin.\nThe global annual average for 2023 in our dataset was estimated as 1.54 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b0C (2.77 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b0F) above the average during the period 1850 to 1900, which is traditionally used a reference for the preindustrial period. This is the first time that any year has exceeded the key 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) threshold. The significance of this is discussed below. Also, please note that given the uncertainties and differences in methodologies, other groups are expected to report 2023 as slightly less than 1.5 \u00b0C above preindustrial. The differences between Berkeley Earth\u2019s analysis and that of other groups is discussed at the end of this report.\nThe last nine years have included all nine of the warmest years observed in the instrumental record.\nThe long-term trend towards higher temperatures is being driven by man-made global warming. However, year-to-year rankings are likely to reflect short-term natural variability. In 2023, an emerging El Ni\u00f1o event combined with other natural and man-made factors discussed below to create a record-breaking warm year. By contrast, 2021 and 2022 had somewhat lower temperatures due to a persistent a La Ni\u00f1a event. The cyclic warming and cooling due to El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a is one of the largest sources of year-to-year internal variability in the global average temperature, often adding or subtracting 0.1 \u00b0C from the global average.\n2023 was a highly unusual year in several respects, including record warmth in most ocean basins and a large deviation from the historical trend. Warmth in 2023 greatly exceeded expectations, and was much stronger than normal this early in an El Ni\u00f1o. Some studies have recently argued that the pace of global warming may be accelerating, and some of the evidence for this is discussed below. However, given historical variability in surface temperatures, it still remains too early to conclude whether or not the pace of surface warming has increased.\nDuring 2023, 17% of the Earth\u2019s surface had a locally record warm annual average. By chance, these areas coincided with a number of major population centers.

With one of the world\u2019s lowest per capita freshwater availability, Jordan\u2019s growing population and limited resources create a dangerous balance. This research paper investigates into the vital role of renewable energy in addressing Jordan\u2019s water woes and proposes a sustainable path for the future. Through a comprehensive case study, integrating renewable energy and water desalination in arid regions represents a promising pathway for sustainable water management and environmental conservation. By harnessing abundant renewable resources, arid regions can address their pressing water needs, mitigate climate change, and reduce dependence on non-renewable energy sources. Overcoming economic barriers and optimizing technology will be crucial in fully unlocking the potential of this innovative approach for a water-secure and environmentally conscious future.\nGlobal water scarcity has far-reaching consequences, affecting developed and developing nations. This pressing issue jeopardizes human rights and threatens economic growth and social stability (Mishra & Tushaus, 2022; Shemer et al., 2023). Climate change acts as a compounding factor, intensifying the challenges associated with water scarcity. The increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events, alterations in the water cycle, and depletion of water resources contribute to the growing crisis (Mahato et al., 2022). Importantly, water scarcity extends beyond a mere quantity problem and manifests as a quality issue. Polluted return flows further degrade water quality, exacerbating the overall problem (Guarino, 2017). This dual challenge of quantity and quality has profound implications for public health. The lack of access to clean water sources results in severe health issues, with contaminated drinking water causing diseases such as diarrhea, leading to significant mortality rates (Van Vliet et al., 2021).\nAddressing water scarcity demands a multifaceted approach. Utilizing alternative water sources, such as desalination and wastewater reclamation, is crucial. Additionally, improving water catchment and harvesting technologies can enhance water availability. Pollution control measures are essential to safeguard water quality. Implementing these actions necessitates coordinated efforts, including centralized governance, educational campaigns, infrastructure development, and transboundary water cooperation. Desalination and wastewater reclamation technologies offer promising solutions by tapping into non-traditional water sources. Advancements in these technologies can provide a sustainable means of meeting water demand in water-scarce regions. Simultaneously, improving water catchment and harvesting technologies helps maximize the efficient use of available water resources.\nCrucially, pollution control measures play a pivotal role in preserving water quality. Mitigating industrial, agricultural, and domestic pollution helps prevent further degradation of water sources. Centralized governance is essential for formulating and enforcing regulations to control pollution effectively. Educational campaigns are vital components of any strategy to address water scarcity. Raising awareness about responsible water usage, conservation practices, and the importance of pollution prevention fosters a collective sense of responsibility. Infrastructure development, including establishing water treatment facilities and distribution networks, ensures reliable access to clean water.\nMoreover, addressing water scarcity often requires collaboration across borders. Transboundary water cooperation is essential, especially in regions where water resources span multiple countries. Joint efforts can lead to more effective and sustainable water management practices, benefiting all involved nations.\nPotential solutions to global water scarcity include infrastructure investment, expansion of clean water technologies such as desalination and treated wastewater reuse, and the application Of Adaptive Inner-Basin Water Allocation Measures (AIWAM) (He et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2021). Infrastructure investment can help relieve water scarcity in more than two-thirds of water-scarce cities, but environmental trade-offs must be considered (Salehi, 2022). Expanding desalination and treated wastewater can significantly reduce water scarcity levels and the number of people affected, especially in Asia. However, side effects such as brine and energy demand must be considered (Endo et al., 2018). Applying AIWAM can mitigate water scarcity for nonagricultural sectors but may increase water scarcity for agriculture in upstream areas. These potential solutions provide useful information for developing adaptation strategies toward sustainable water management.\nMitigating global water scarcity necessitates a holistic approach encompassing technological innovations, regulatory frameworks, educational initiatives, and international cooperation. By implementing a comprehensive strategy, the world can ensure equitable access to clean water, promote sustainable development, and safeguard communities\u2019 well-being worldwide. A comprehensive understanding of global water scarcity involves recognizing the interconnected nature of water quantity and quality, understanding the dynamic changes in terrestrial water storage, acknowledging historical trends, addressing monthly water scarcity challenges, and grappling with the consequences of increased water consumption over the 20th century. Addressing these aspects collectively is essential for formulating effective and sustainable water management strategies globally.\nWater scarcity is a complex and widespread global challenge arising from both insufficient water quantity and compromised water quality. Water scarcity is not only about the physical availability of water but also about its suitability for various uses. Including water quality in assessments signifi\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

In developed countries its use has greatly declined because of electrification. However, in developing countries, kerosene use for cooking and lighting remains widespread. This review focuses on household kerosene uses, mainly in developing countries, their associated emissions, and their hazards. Kerosene is often advocated as a cleaner alternative to solid fuels, biomass and coal, for cooking, and kerosene lamps are frequently used when electricity is unavailable. Globally, an estimated 500 million households still use fuels, particularly kerosene, for lighting. However, there are few studies, study designs and quality are varied, and results are inconsistent. Well-documented kerosene hazards are poisonings, fires, and explosions. Less investigated are exposures to and risks from kerosene\u2019s combustion products. Some kerosene-using devices emit substantial amounts of fine particulates, carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxides (NOx), and sulfur dioxide (SO2). Studies of kerosene used for cooking or lighting provide some evidence that emissions may impair lung function and increase infectious illness (including tuberculosis), asthma, and cancer risks. However, there are few study designs, quality is varied, and results are inconsistent. Considering the widespread use in the developing world of kerosene, the scarcity of adequate epidemiologic investigations, the potential for harm, and the implications for national energy policies, researchers are strongly encouraged to consider collecting data on household kerosene uses in studies of health in developing countries. Given the potential risks of kerosene, policymakers may consider alternatives to kerosene subsidies, such as shifting support to cleaner technologies for lighting and cooking.\nSince the mid-19th century, when it replaced the more expensive whale oil as a lighting fuel, kerosene (synonyms: kerosine, paraffin, paraffin oil, fuel oil no. 1, lamp oil) has become a major household, commercial, and industrial fuel. \u201cKerosene\u201d started as a brand name but was later adopted (with a small \u201ck\u201d) as a general descriptor. In the first half of the 20th century, the prevalence of household kerosene lighting greatly reduced as electrification and availability of gas fuels spread, particularly in developed countries. However, in the developing countries of Africa, Asia, and Latin America, kerosene use for cooking and lighting remains widespread. Globally, an estimated 500 million households still rely on kerosene or other liquid fuels for lighting, corresponding to 7.6 billion liters consumed annually (Mills 2005).\nProduced originally from coal (\u201ccoal oil\u201d), but later from the fractional distillation of petroleum oil, kerosene is a transparent liquid fuel with a mixture of hydrocarbon chains 6 to 16 carbon atoms in length. Although kerosene has numerous commercial and industrial applications (e.g., aviation fuel, general solvent), the focus of this article is on household uses, for cooking, heating, and lighting, in low- and middle-income countries. These lead to the most widespread exposures to kerosene and its combustion products.\nKerosene is commonly used in countries where solid fuels\u2014biomass (wood, agricultural residues, and animal dung) and coal\u2014are major household energy sources, often burned indoors without chimneys or smoke hoods. Exposures to combustion products from solid fuels have been associated with a range of health effects, including lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), low birth weight, cataracts, pneumonia, and tuberculosis (Fullerton et al. 2008). Justifiably, pollution from solid fuels has provoked efforts to find alternative energy sources or ways of burning biomass more cleanly. Least polluting alternatives at the household level are solar power and electricity. Gaseous fuels, particularly liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and natural gas, which burn with higher combustion efficiency, resulting in fewer products of incomplete combustion compared to solid fuels, are the cooking fuels of choice in most countries. Biogas made from anaerobic digestion of animal dung is used where conditions are suitable. These alternatives, however, are often unavailable or unaffordable, and kerosene is sometimes advocated as an alternative cleaner fuel for cooking and is often used for lighting where electricity is not available. Some countries, such as India and Nepal, subsidize its retail price to stabilize in-country prices and make it affordable to the poor. However, there is substantial black market diversion of subsidized kerosene, as it mixes easily with the often more expensive diesel fuel, and it is often sold illegally in surrounding countries that do not subsidize it (Parikh 2010; Shenoy 2010).\nOther than some older studies of portable kerosene heating stoves in developed countries, there seems to have been little, if any, systematic study of the exposure implications and hazards of household kerosene combustion, possibly because kerosene is often assumed to be \u201ccleaner burning\u201d than biomass fuels for heating and cooking.\nThe purposes of this review are to (1) systematically examine what is known about household uses of kerosene, its combustion products and exposures to these, and their hazards; (2) identify gaps in knowledge and research needs; and (3) identify any policy implications of current knowledge. The emphasis is on kerosene use in developing countries, where it is widely used as a household fuel. However, developed-country experience is cited where it is informative. The hazards of poisoning and fire associated with kerosene are only briefly discussed, as these have been reviewed elsewhere (Peck et al. 2008; Tshiamo 2009).

Given the predominance of fossil fuels, we re-evaluate the volumes of global water withdrawal and consumption for the different cycles of energy recovery and processing of fossil fuels. Based upon updated water intensity and energy utilization data,the combined global water withdrawal for the different stages of fossil fuels extraction and production increased from 283x109 m3 in early 1990s to 642x109 m3 in 2019, while global water consumption increased from 33.9x109 m3 to 57.8x109 m3. The revised estimate of water use far exceed previous estimates, reflecting the rapid rise of global energy consumption, in particular the increasing intensity of unconventional oil and gas exploration. Coal mining and combustion were the major components of the global water withdrawal (62%) and consumption (57%). Crude oil has an important water consumption footprint (34%), and increasing natural gas utilization also has a large water withdrawal component (33%). Parallel to water use, we estimate that the global wastewater from all of the major components of fossil fuels in 2019 was 43 x109 m3, in which coal and crude oil wastewaters consisted of 52% and 46%, respectively. Given the high levels of contaminants, the release of even small volume of the wastewater through spills, leaks or inadequate management to the environment severely affects the water quality of the receiving water and thus induces a large impaired-water intensity, which commonly is not evaluated in the energy-water nexus paradigm. Reevaluation of energy-water nexus, considering water quality degradation indicates that the water intensity of fossil fuels is even larger than the estimated water footprint based on water quantity alone. The environmental legacy of fossil fuels will continue to impact the quality of water resources for decades to come, even in scenarios where fossil fuels utilization is declining. The fragmented policy landscape across different scales has devolved regulatory authority for the energy-water quality nexus to subnational actors and the private sector itself in many instances.\nadshelp[at]cfa.harvard.edu\nThe ADS is operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory under NASA Cooperative Agreement 80NSSC21M0056\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

In 2023, the power sector was the largest source of global greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe science is clear: to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, emissions must be reduced by almost half by 2030, and reach net-zero by 2050.\nTo achieve this, we need to end our reliance on fossil fuels and invest in alternative sources of energy that are clean, accessible, affordable, sustainable, and reliable.\nRenewable energy sources \u2014 such as sunlight, wind, water, organic waste, and heat from the Earth \u2014 are abundant, replenished by nature, and emit little to no greenhouse gases or air pollutants.\nFossil fuels still account for nearly 60 per cent of electricity generation, but cleaner sources of energy are gaining ground. Between 2015 and 2024, annual electricity capacity of renewables increased by around 2,600 gigawatts (GW) - a 140 per cent increase. In the same period, fossil fuels electricity capacity only increased by around 640 GW (16 per cent).\nHere are five reasons why accelerating the transition to clean energy is the pathway to a healthy, livable planet today and for generations to come.\nAbout 80 per cent of the global population lives in countries that are net-importers of fossil fuels - that\u2019s about 6 billion people who are dependent on fossil fuels from other countries, which makes them vulnerable to geopolitical shocks and crises.\nIn contrast, renewable energy sources are available in all countries, and their potential is yet to be fully harnessed. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimates that 90 percent of the world\u2019s electricity can and should come from renewable energy by 2050.\nRenewables offer a way out of import dependency, allowing countries to diversify their economies and protect them from the unpredictable price swings of fossil fuels, while driving inclusive economic growth, new jobs, and poverty alleviation.\nToday, renewable energy is the most affordable source of power in most parts of the world.\nPrices for renewable energy technologies are dropping rapidly. Over 90 per cent of new renewable projects are now cheaper than fossil fuels alternatives. At the same time, solar and offshore wind are now respectively 41 per cent and 53 per cent cheaper than fossil fuels.\nDeclining prices are making renewable energy more attractive worldwide \u2013 including to low- and middle-income countries, where most of the future demand for new electricity will arise. This creates a real opportunity for much of the new power supply over the coming years to come from low-carbon sources. By 2040, for instance, Africa could generate 10 times more electricity than it needs \u2013 entirely from renewables.\nRenewable energy can also help meet new electricity demand, particularly for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and data centres. A typical AI data centre eats up as much electricity as 100,000 homes. Every major tech firm should switch to 100 per cent renewables to power data centres by 2030.\nCheap electricity from renewable sources could provide 65 per cent of the world\u2019s total electricity supply by 2030. It could decarbonize 90 per cent of the power sector by 2050, massively cutting carbon emissions and helping to mitigate climate change.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), about 99 percent of people in the world breathe air that exceeds air quality limits and threatens their health. Air pollution is associated with 7 million premature deaths every year.\nThe unhealthy levels of fine particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide originate mainly from the burning of fossil fuels. The economic health damage caused by air pollution amounts to $8.1 trillion a year, equivalent to 6.1 per cent of global GDP.\nSwitching to clean sources of energy, such as wind and solar, helps address not only climate change but also air pollution and health.\nClean energy sector jobs already outnumber fossil fuel jobs \u2013 employing almost 35 million people worldwide. In 2023, 16.2 million people were employed in the renewable energy sector, up from 13.7 million in 2022.\nFor every dollar invested, renewable energy creates three times as many jobs as the fossil fuel industry. The IEA estimates that the transition towards net-zero emissions will lead to an overall increase in energy sector jobs: while about 5 million jobs in fossil fuel production could be lost by 2030, an estimated 14 million new jobs would be created in clean energy, resulting in a net gain of 9 million jobs.\nIn addition, energy-related industries will need 16 million more workers, for instance to take on new roles manufacturing electric vehicles and hyper-efficient appliances, or in innovative technologies such as hydrogen economy. This means that a total of more than 30 million jobs could be created in clean energy, efficiency, and low-emissions technologies by 2030.\nEnsuring a just transition, placing the needs and rights of people at the heart of the energy transition, will be paramount to make sure no one is left behind.\nIn 2024, $2 trillion went into clean energy \u2013 $800 billion more than fossil fuels and up almost 70 per cent in ten years. In 2023 alone, clean energy sectors drove 10 per cent of global GDP growth.\nFurthermore, energy-related carbon dioxide emissions are growing more slowly than the global economy. Emissions growth slowed to 0.8 per cent in 2024, while the global economy expanded by more than 3 per cent.\nYet, the fossil fuel industry continues to be heavily subsidized. About $7 trillion was spent on fossil fuels in 2022, including through explicit subsidies, tax breaks, and health and environmental damages that were not priced into the cost of fossil fuels.\nIn comparison, about $4.5 trillion a year needs to be invested in renewable energy until 2030 \u2013 including investments in technology and infr\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Yet today we are experiencing transitions away from fossil fuel toward cleaner and sustainable energy sources. These transitions include shifts to renewable energy, electric vehicles, pedestrian pathways and more walkable cities, energy efficiency measures in the built environment, and increased public transportation. This restructuring of our energy system will bring impacts on public health (e.g., improved air quality from lower use of traditional gasoline-powered vehicles). Furthermore, the transition can lower emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), thereby helping slow climate change and minimize its anticipated impacts on public health. While more work is needed to understand the full implications of these energy transitions, including the implications for environmental justice in terms of who will share in the health benefits and potential detriments such as increased emissions from brake wear for electric vehicles, the existing literature indicates substantial benefits to public health.

In developed countries its use has greatly declined because of electrification. However, in developing countries, kerosene use for cooking and lighting remains widespread. This review focuses on household kerosene uses, mainly in developing countries, their associated emissions, and their hazards. Kerosene is often advocated as a cleaner alternative to solid fuels, biomass and coal, for cooking, and kerosene lamps are frequently used when electricity is unavailable. Globally, an estimated 500 million households still use fuels, particularly kerosene, for lighting. However, there are few studies, study designs and quality are varied, and results are inconsistent. Well-documented kerosene hazards are poisonings, fires, and explosions. Less investigated are exposures to and risks from kerosene\u2019s combustion products. Some kerosene-using devices emit substantial amounts of fine particulates, carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxides (NOx), and sulfur dioxide (SO2). Studies of kerosene used for cooking or lighting provide some evidence that emissions may impair lung function and increase infectious illness (including tuberculosis), asthma, and cancer risks. However, there are few study designs, quality is varied, and results are inconsistent. Considering the widespread use in the developing world of kerosene, the scarcity of adequate epidemiologic investigations, the potential for harm, and the implications for national energy policies, researchers are strongly encouraged to consider collecting data on household kerosene uses in studies of health in developing countries. Given the potential risks of kerosene, policymakers may consider alternatives to kerosene subsidies, such as shifting support to cleaner technologies for lighting and cooking.\nSince the mid-19th century, when it replaced the more expensive whale oil as a lighting fuel, kerosene (synonyms: kerosine, paraffin, paraffin oil, fuel oil no. 1, lamp oil) has become a major household, commercial, and industrial fuel. \u201cKerosene\u201d started as a brand name but was later adopted (with a small \u201ck\u201d) as a general descriptor. In the first half of the 20th century, the prevalence of household kerosene lighting greatly reduced as electrification and availability of gas fuels spread, particularly in developed countries. However, in the developing countries of Africa, Asia, and Latin America, kerosene use for cooking and lighting remains widespread. Globally, an estimated 500 million households still rely on kerosene or other liquid fuels for lighting, corresponding to 7.6 billion liters consumed annually (Mills 2005).\nProduced originally from coal (\u201ccoal oil\u201d), but later from the fractional distillation of petroleum oil, kerosene is a transparent liquid fuel with a mixture of hydrocarbon chains 6 to 16 carbon atoms in length. Although kerosene has numerous commercial and industrial applications (e.g., aviation fuel, general solvent), the focus of this article is on household uses, for cooking, heating, and lighting, in low- and middle-income countries. These lead to the most widespread exposures to kerosene and its combustion products.\nKerosene is commonly used in countries where solid fuels\u2014biomass (wood, agricultural residues, and animal dung) and coal\u2014are major household energy sources, often burned indoors without chimneys or smoke hoods. Exposures to combustion products from solid fuels have been associated with a range of health effects, including lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), low birth weight, cataracts, pneumonia, and tuberculosis (Fullerton et al. 2008). Justifiably, pollution from solid fuels has provoked efforts to find alternative energy sources or ways of burning biomass more cleanly. Least polluting alternatives at the household level are solar power and electricity. Gaseous fuels, particularly liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and natural gas, which burn with higher combustion efficiency, resulting in fewer products of incomplete combustion compared to solid fuels, are the cooking fuels of choice in most countries. Biogas made from anaerobic digestion of animal dung is used where conditions are suitable. These alternatives, however, are often unavailable or unaffordable, and kerosene is sometimes advocated as an alternative cleaner fuel for cooking and is often used for lighting where electricity is not available. Some countries, such as India and Nepal, subsidize its retail price to stabilize in-country prices and make it affordable to the poor. However, there is substantial black market diversion of subsidized kerosene, as it mixes easily with the often more expensive diesel fuel, and it is often sold illegally in surrounding countries that do not subsidize it (Parikh 2010; Shenoy 2010).\nOther than some older studies of portable kerosene heating stoves in developed countries, there seems to have been little, if any, systematic study of the exposure implications and hazards of household kerosene combustion, possibly because kerosene is often assumed to be \u201ccleaner burning\u201d than biomass fuels for heating and cooking.\nThe purposes of this review are to (1) systematically examine what is known about household uses of kerosene, its combustion products and exposures to these, and their hazards; (2) identify gaps in knowledge and research needs; and (3) identify any policy implications of current knowledge. The emphasis is on kerosene use in developing countries, where it is widely used as a household fuel. However, developed-country experience is cited where it is informative. The hazards of poisoning and fire associated with kerosene are only briefly discussed, as these have been reviewed elsewhere (Peck et al. 2008; Tshiamo 2009). For an assessment of the occupational literature and associated risks from exposure to fuel vapors and nonresidential combustion sources, readers are referred to an\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Although kerosene has numerous commercial and industrial applications (e.g., aviation fuel, general solvent), the focus of this article is on household uses, for cooking, heating, and lighting, in low- and middle-income countries. These lead to the most widespread exposures to kerosene and its combustion products.\nKerosene is commonly used in countries where solid fuels\u2014biomass (wood, agricultural residues, and animal dung) and coal\u2014are major household energy sources, often burned indoors without chimneys or smoke hoods. Exposures to combustion products from solid fuels have been associated with a range of health effects, including lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), low birth weight, cataracts, pneumonia, and tuberculosis (Fullerton et al. 2008). Justifiably, pollution from solid fuels has provoked efforts to find alternative energy sources or ways of burning biomass more cleanly. Least polluting alternatives at the household level are solar power and electricity. Gaseous fuels, particularly liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and natural gas, which burn with higher combustion efficiency, resulting in fewer products of incomplete combustion compared to solid fuels, are the cooking fuels of choice in most countries. Biogas made from anaerobic digestion of animal dung is used where conditions are suitable. These alternatives, however, are often unavailable or unaffordable, and kerosene is sometimes advocated as an alternative cleaner fuel for cooking and is often used for lighting where electricity is not available. Some countries, such as India and Nepal, subsidize its retail price to stabilize in-country prices and make it affordable to the poor. However, there is substantial black market diversion of subsidized kerosene, as it mixes easily with the often more expensive diesel fuel, and it is often sold illegally in surrounding countries that do not subsidize it (Parikh 2010; Shenoy 2010).\nOther than some older studies of portable kerosene heating stoves in developed countries, there seems to have been little, if any, systematic study of the exposure implications and hazards of household kerosene combustion, possibly because kerosene is often assumed to be \u201ccleaner burning\u201d than biomass fuels for heating and cooking.\nThe purposes of this review are to (1) systematically examine what is known about household uses of kerosene, its combustion products and exposures to these, and their hazards; (2) identify gaps in knowledge and research needs; and (3) identify any policy implications of current knowledge.

Economic, social and health advances have been built on these valuable assets. Fossil fuels have enabled the heating of homes, transportation to jobs and vital services, powering of hospitals and sanitation systems, and the production and delivery of food. However, these same resources are the leading driver of changes which are already harming people\u2019s health, communities, and the planet on which we depend for survival. Health is impacted throughout the entire cycle of fossil fuel use \u2014 from \u201ccradle to grave\u201d \u2014 from extraction, through processing, transport, combustion and waste disposal. These processes drive pollution of air, water and soil as well as climate change.\nThis short brief examines the impact of fossil fuel extraction, production and combustion on human health, the role subsidies play as supporting fiscal architecture for fossil fuel dependence, and solutions to achieve fossil fuel phase-out across sectors, before identifying key recommendations.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",
