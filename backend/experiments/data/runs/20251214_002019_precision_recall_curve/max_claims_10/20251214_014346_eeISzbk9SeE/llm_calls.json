The origin of the 1.5\u00b0C Paris Agreement limit derived from the concern ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nThe central objective of the Paris Agreement is its long-term temperature goal to hold global average temperature increase to \u201cwell below 2\u00b0C above preindustrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels\u201d. This is referred to by the CAT as the 1.5\u00b0C Paris Agreement goal.\nThis goal is linked to a requirement in the Paris Agreement1 that all countries work together to bring greenhouse gas emissions to zero within the second half of the 21st century, with the timing of when the zero emissions are reached being determined by the best available science in relation to the achievement of the long-term temperature goal. The long-term temperature goal in the Paris Agreement goes significantly further, both legally and substantively, than the earlier goal to hold warming to below 2\u00b0C (Schleussner et al. 2016).\nThe Copenhagen Accord from 2009 mentions the long-term temperature goal of holding the global temperature increase to \u201cbelow 2 degrees Celsius\u201d (UNFCCC 2010). One year later, Parties to the UNFCCC adopted the Cancun Agreements which \u201cfurther recognised that deep cuts in global GHG emissions are required, with a view to hold the increase in global average temperature below 2\u00b0C above preindustrial levels\u201d. This is referred to by the CAT as the Cancun 2\u00b0C goal.\nThe 1.5\u00b0C Paris Agreement goal is, by design, a strengthening of the Cancun 2\u00b0C goal.\nThe origin of the 1.5\u00b0C Paris Agreement limit derived from the concern amongst the vulnerable countries about the adverse consequences of a 2\u00b0C warming level. In 2014 the UNFCCC established a process to review whether the long-term Cancun goal of holding warming below 2\u00b0C was adequate to avoid dangerous climate change and to consider \u201cstrengthening the long-term global goal on the basis of the best available scientific knowledge, including in relation to a global average temperature rise of 1.5\u00b0C\u201d 2. This process ended in 2015 with the final report of its scientific arm (Structured Expert Dialogue) concluding that using the globally-agreed warming limit of 2\u00b0C as a \u201cguardrail\u201d is not safe, and that governments should aim for 1.5\u00b0C instead3. The 2\u00b0C limit was found not to be in line with the ultimate objective of the Convention to \u201cprevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.\u201d This was a key input into the Paris Agreement negotiations then underway and led ultimately to the Paris Agreement\u2019s long-term temperature goal in Article 2.1 as described above.\nOne of the key architectural concepts of the Cancun 2\u00b0C goal that carried over into the Paris agreement long-term temperature goal is that of \"holding warming\" below a certain level. The \u201chold below\u201d formulation is clearly stronger than a returning to a certain level of warming by a certain time (up to 2100 (from an implicitly higher-level). In the negotiations of this warming goal, formulations such as returning to 2\u00b0C by 2100 were proposed and rejected. In examining any set of emission pathways consistent with a long-term temperature goal, a requirement to hold below a certain level of warming requires greater and faster would emission reductions than a temperature goal that requires returning to a certain degree of warming by, for example, 2100. This has concrete implications for policy \u2013 and emission pathways - and as a consequence the Climate Action Tracker has been careful to use pathways that are fully consistent with the goals.\nThe probability of achieving a given temperature target has also been a discussion point, but not as explicitly as concepts such as holding warming below a certain level or return warming to a certain level by a certain time. In general, it is fairly well accepted that pathways that assess specific warming goals should meet those goals with a likely or greater probability. Few would argue that a specific warming goal should be met with only a 50% chance (toss of a coin).\nOver the years, there has been a strong consensus within the scientific community in interpreting the Cancun goal of holding warming below 2\u00b0C to use the \u201clikely below\u201d 2\u00b0C class of scenarios in the scientific literature. These energy-economic model scenarios have a 66% chance, or greater, of staying below a 2\u00b0C global mean warming above pre-industrial levels throughout the 21st century.\nThe Climate Action Tracker has used these pathways as benchmark for emissions reductions in line with Cancun 2\u00b0C goal, as well as a basis for assessing the adequacy of efforts of individual countries.\nFrom its inception in 2009 the Climate Action Tracker itself has consistently referred to the 1.5\u00b0C global mean warming limit in its analyses, alongside the 2\u00b0C pathway, particularly in relation to comparing the global effect of pledges and commitments with emission pathways for both these warming limits.\nAs noted, above the Paris Agreement 1.5\u00b0C goal, by design, goes beyond the Cancun Agreements\u2019 below 2\u00b0C limit and aims to hold warming to well below 2\u00b0C and to pursue efforts to limit temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C.\nThe most comprehensive and up-to-date assessment of Paris Agreement compatible mitigation pathways is the recent IPCC Special Report on 1.5\u00b0C (SR1.5). Its Summary for Policy Makers (SPM) (IPCC, 2018) established 1.5\u00b0C compatible mitigation pathways as being pathways with no- or limited-overshoot. These pathways limit median global warming to 1.5\u00b0C throughout the 21st century without exceeding that level (\u201cno-overshoot\u201d), or allow warming to drop below 1.5\u00b0C by the end of the century (around 1.3\u00b0C warming by 2100) after a brief and limited overshoot of median peak warming below 1.6\u00b0C around the 2060s (\u201clow-overshoot\u201d). With a peak warming of (at most) 1.6oC these pathways meet several tests with reference to the Paris Agreement LTTG.\nThe \u201chold below 2\u00b0C\u201d pathways hold warming below 2\u00b0C with a least 66% probability and have peak 21st century warming of up to 1.8\u00b0C, whereas 1.5\u00b0C compatible mitigation pathways in IPCC SR1.5 peak warming a\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

However, recent climate changes cannot be explained by natural causes alone.\nChanges in the earth\u2019s orbit and its axis of rotation have had a big impact on climate in the past. For example, the amount of summer sunshine on the Northern Hemisphere, which is affected by changes in the planet\u2019s orbit, appears to be the primary cause of past cycles of ice ages, in which the earth has experienced long periods of cold temperatures (ice ages), as well as shorter interglacial periods (periods between ice ages) of relatively warmer temperatures.1 At the coldest part of the last glacial period (or ice age), the average global temperature was about 11\u00b0F colder than it is today. At the peak of the last interglacial period, however, the average global temperature was at most 2\u00b0F warmer than it is today.2\nChanges in the sun\u2019s energy output can affect the intensity of the sunlight that reaches the earth\u2019s surface. While these changes can influence the earth\u2019s climate, solar variations have played little role in the climate changes observed in recent decades.3 Satellites have been measuring the amount of energy the earth receives from the sun since 1978. These measurements show no net increase in the sun\u2019s output, even as global surface temperatures have risen.4\nThe amount of sunlight that is absorbed or reflected by the planet depends on the earth\u2019s surface and atmosphere. Dark objects and surfaces, like the ocean, forests, and soil, tend to absorb more sunlight. Light-colored objects and surfaces, like snow and clouds, tend to reflect sunlight. About 70 percent of the sunlight that reaches the earth is absorbed.5 Natural changes in the earth\u2019s surface, like the melting of sea ice, have contributed to climate change in the past, often acting as feedbacks to other processes.\nVolcanoes have played a noticeable role in climate, and volcanic eruptions released large quantities of carbon dioxide in the distant past. Some explosive volcano eruptions can throw particles (e.g., SO2) into the upper atmosphere, where they can reflect enough sunlight back to space to cool the surface of the planet for several years.6 These particles are an example of cooling aerosols.\nVolcanic particles from a single eruption do not produce long-term climate change because they remain in the atmosphere for a much shorter time than greenhouse gases. In addition, human activities emit more than 100 times as much carbon dioxide as volcanoes each year.7\nOver the last several hundred thousand years, carbon dioxide levels varied in tandem with the glacial cycles. During warm interglacial periods, carbon dioxide levels were higher. During cool glacial periods, carbon dioxide levels were lower.8 The heating or cooling of the earth\u2019s surface and oceans can cause changes in the natural sources and sinks of these gases, and thus change greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.9 These changing concentrations have acted as a positive climate feedback, amplifying the temperature changes caused by long-term shifts in the earth\u2019s orbit.10\n1 National Academy of Sciences.

Ecosystems and people in the United States and around the world are affected by the ongoing process of climate change today.\nA collage of events related to climate and weather: loss of glacial ice, wildfires, hurricanes, floods, and drought. (Image credit: NOAA)\nClimate change affects the environment in many different ways, including rising temperatures, sea level rise, drought, flooding, and more. These events affect things that we depend upon and value, like water, energy, transportation, wildlife, agriculture, ecosystems, and human health.\nNOAA monitors weather and climate around the world. Here are some of the ways that climate change is affecting our planet. You can explore more at NOAA\u2019s Global Climate Dashboard.\nTemperature increased about 2\u00b0F (1.1\u00b0C) from 1850 to 2023. Updated January 2024.\nClimate change impacts our society in many different ways. Drought can harm food production and human health. Flooding can lead to spread of disease, death, and damage ecosystems and infrastructure. Human health issues that result from drought, flooding, and other weather conditions increase the death rate, change food availability, and limit how much a worker can get done, and ultimately the productivity of our economy.\nThere is still time to lessen the impacts and severity of climate change. We already know many of the problems and solutions offsite link , and researchers continue to find new ones. Experts believe we can avoid the worst outcomes by reducing emissions to zero as quickly as possible, which will limit warming offsite link . To meet this goal, we will have to invest in new technology and infrastructure, which will spur job growth. For example, we will need to continue improving technology and facilities that capture and process renewable energy. Lowering emissions will also benefit human health, saving countless lives and billions of dollars in expenses related to health.\nInteractive graphs and maps showing how climate conditions in U.S. states and territories are projected to change over the coming decades.\nIn the following sections, we will look at some of the effects climate change has on our resources and society. Use the links below to jump to a specific section.\nThe effects of climate change on our water resources can have a big impact on our world and our lives. Patterns of where, when, and how much precipitation falls are changing as temperatures rise. Some areas are experiencing heavier rain events while others are having more droughts.\nFlooding is an increasing issue as our climate is changing. Compared to the beginning of the 20th century, precipitation events are stronger, heavier, and more frequent across most of the United States.\nDrought is also becoming more common, especially in the Western United States. We are using more water during hot weather, especially for agriculture. Much like we sweat more when it is hot out, hot weather causes plants to lose, or transpire, more water. Then, farmers must give their crops more water.\nSnowpack is an important source of fresh water for many people. As the snow melts, fresh water becomes available for use. Snowmelt is particularly important in regions like the Western United States where there is not much precipitation in warmer months. But as temperatures warm, there is less snow and snow begins to melt earlier in the year. This means that snowpack is less likely to be a reliable source of water.\nOur food supply depends on climate and weather conditions. Higher temperatures, drought and water stress, diseases, and weather extremes create challenges for farmers and ranchers. Farmers, ranchers, and researchers can address some of these challenges by adapting their methods or creating and using new technology. But, some changes will be difficult to manage, like human and livestock health. Farmworkers can suffer from heat-related health issues, like exhaustion, heatstroke, and heart attacks. Heat can also harm livestock.\nFries depend on potatoes, and like all crops, potatoes have a preferred climate. How long will America\u2019s favorite side dish have a safe spot on our menu?\nClimate change is already impacting human health. Changes in weather and climate patterns put lives at risk in many ways:\nClimate change affects all living things, or organisms, and the environment they live in, but not equally. The Arctic is one of the ecosystems most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. It is warming at least twice as fast as the global average. Warming in the Arctic has impacts that are felt across the globe \u2014 melting land ice sheets and glaciers contribute dramatically offsite link to sea level rise. Sea levels are also rising due to thermal expansion. Higher sea level puts coastal areas at greater risk of erosion and storm surge.\nEffects of climate change can build upon one another to damage ecosystems. Sea level rise can cause sediment to smother corals. But, coral reefs are also vulnerable to many other effects of climate change: warming waters can lead to coral bleaching and stronger hurricanes can destroy reefs. Coral reef ecosystems are home to thousands of species, which rely on healthy coral reefs to survive.\nSome organisms are able to adapt to and even benefit from climate change. Some plants have longer growing seasons or are blooming earlier. But, these changes can happen too fast for other plants and animals to keep up. For example, an earlier blooming plant may depend on a pollinator that does not adapt as quickly.\nThere are also species that have adapted by expanding or shifting their geographic range, meaning they live in new pl\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

That spike in global temperatures is fueling climate disasters that will only get worse unless we take action. Experts warn that we are running out of time to dramatically cut pollution to avoid climate catastrophe.\nRead on to learn more, find out what Earthjustice is doing to help the planet change course, and how you can help.\nStorm systems draw their energy from warm ocean water\nHurricanes are growing more powerful as global temperatures rise because these storm systems draw their energy from warm ocean water.\nIn September 2024, Hurricane Helene caused historic flooding across the Southeast United States, killing at least 121 people and leaving millions without power. Earlier in the summer, the Gulf Coast endured Hurricane Beryl, the earliest category 5 hurricane on record, fueled by exceptionally warm ocean waters.\nScientists warn that as our climate warms, storms will not only become stronger, but they will intensify faster.\nLarger fires in hot, dry years\nWildfires have always been a natural part of life in the western United States and Canada. However, as this region grows hotter and drier, wildfires are growing in size, ferocity, and speed.\nThe hazardous air pollution that wildfire smoke creates can spread far beyond the region burned. In summer 2023, smoke wafting down from nearly 900 wildfires tearing through Canada triggered air quality alerts that affected as many as 70 million people across the eastern United States.\nAnd then there\u2019s the destruction on the ground.\nIn recent years, California has been particulary prone to devastating blazes. With record dry, hot conditions across the state, seasonal high winds (known as Diablo in Northern California and Santa Ana in the southern part of the state) caused wildfires to grow and spread at an unprecedented rate.\nHeat waves pose health risks and strain our energy system\nAs global temperatures rise, the hottest temperatures \u2014 and the number of areas impacted by extreme heat \u2014 are also rising. That means more scorching hot days in more places.\nIn California\u2019s Death Valley this July, thermometers neared the hottest temperature ever recorded, hovering around 130 degrees. That same month, the average global temperature hit an all-time high.\nIt\u2019s not just that individual hot days are breaking records \u2014 there\u2019s an overall warming trend. Take the Texas cities of Austin and Houston, for example. Over the past 50 years, Austin has seen the number of days with temperatures above 100\u00b0F increase by one month, while Houston has recorded an additional month with temperatures above 95\u00b0F. In in the past century.\nMoisture evaporates from waterbodies and soil\nHigher temperatures also lead to drier conditions. When global temperatures rise, moisture evaporates from waterbodies and soil.\nDroughts in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world have become more severe and long-lasting thanks to climate change.\nIn fact, the American West is currently in the midst of a mega drought that ranks among the worst in the past 1,200 years, even after heavy rainfall in 2023. Much of the region is currently facing \"extreme\" or \"exceptional\" drought conditions.\nAreas that have historically trended toward heavy precipitation will get wetter\nWarmer air increases evaporation, which means that our atmosphere contains an increasing amount of water vapor for storms to sweep up and turn into rain or snow.\nJust as drier areas are likely to get drier with rising global temperatures, those areas of the world that have historically trended toward heavy precipitation will only get wetter.\nAt least 137 people died in Texas in July 2025 due to storms that dumped an amount of water greater than the daily flow of Niagara Falls in just a few hours, raising the Guadalupe River by more than 20 feet.\nThough it is difficult to determine with certainty whether climate change caused any specific weather event, scientists say that global warming will make storms like this one more common. New rain estimates issued in 2023 indicate that 12.6 million properties across the U.S. that were not previously thought to be at flood risk now are due to the increased likelihood of extreme precipitation events.\nOceans are warming; land ice is melting\nAs the planet warms, ocean waters are also warming \u2014 and expanding. At the same time, warmer temperatures are causing land ice \u2014 think glaciers and ice caps \u2014 to melt, which is adding water to the world\u2019s oceans.\nAs a result, average global sea level has increased eight inches in the last 150 years.\nThe Atlantic coast of the United States and the Gulf of Mexico are experiencing some of the highest sea level rise in the world, which, combined with record rainfall, has led to catastrophic flooding.\nTrapped water vapor leads to heavier snowfall\nEven as climate change raises average global temperatures, that doesn\u2019t spell the end of winters. Overall, winters are getting milder and shorter; but recent winters have brought intense snowstorms and record-breaking frost.\nAs a result, average global sea level has increased eight inches in the last 150 years.\nWhile it may seem contradictory, climate change may be contributing to more extreme winter weather\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This engraving by Edward Goodall (1795-1870), originally titled \"Manchester, from Kersal Moor,\" after a painting of W. Wylde, shows numerous industrial chimneys in the town of Manchester, England, which earned the nickname \"Cottonopolis,\" following its transformation. Image in the public domain, from Wikimedia.\nWhen you read or hear climate numbers, they are often being compared to average. The September 2023 NOAA global surface temperatures, for instance, were 1.44 degrees Celsius above average. That average represents a defined period of time. In this case, September was 1.44\u00b0C warmer than the average September of the twentieth century.\nFor the 1.5\u00b0C climate threshold, the \u201caverage\u201d time range is defined as the \u201cpre-industrial period\u201d, or the period of time before the increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases due to human-emissions began to significantly influence global temperatures. Sounds a bit vague, right? What years make up this \u201cpre-industrial period?\u201d It depends.\nMost history books define the dates of the Industrial Revolution as between the mid-1700s and mid-1800s, but scientific definitions of pre-industrial typically cover some range of decades between 1850 and 1900. Why? Because that\u2019s the earliest time period with widespread, consistent surface temperature records. Different research groups use different parts of the broader time range. For NOAA data, we currently define pre-industrial as 1850-1900. (Footnote 1)\nWhile there can be differences in what counts as \u201cpre-industrial\u201d, it's important to remember that industrial versus pre-industrial is really about the human signature on our climate and how scientists can distinguish that from natural variability going back thousands of years. (Footnote 2)\nHow far the global temperature is above average depends on how you define average. For NOAA's global temperature dataset, \"pre-industrial\" is defined as the period from 1850-1900. For routine monthly reports, NOAA compares monthly temperatures to the 20th-century average. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from NCEI.\nAdding to the nuance, global surface temperature itself can potentially refer to different temperature variables measured in different ways. On land, thermometer-measured temperature variables can include readings at both at the literal ground surface and at two meters above. Over water, ships and buoys can measure the surface ocean temperature directly as well as the air temperature two meters above the water. From high above, satellites don\u2019t directly measure temperatures, but scientists derive land surface and atmospheric temperatures based on the amount of thermal and microwave energy satellites receive.\nSuffice to say, there are a lot of ways of measuring temperatures. And THEN there are different ways of combining those observations into a global dataset. (Despite these differences, all major temperature records show a similar long-term warming trend.) When NOAA releases the latest monthly climate statistics, it uses the NOAA Global Surface Temperature (NOAAGlobalTemp) dataset which blends in-ocean sea surface temperatures and 2-meter air temperatures.\nSo, when you come across stories about the 1.5\u00b0C threshold\u2014especially if you think you\u2019re seeing contradictory stories about whether we have or haven\u2019t reached 1.5\u00b0C\u2014 you should ask yourself three questions. 1) What is the dataset? 2) What is the \u201cpre-industrial\u201d time period? 3) What kind of temperature is being used? Those are the details you need to be able to put that story into context and compare it to other sources of information.\nLet\u2019s go back in time before large international climate conferences like COP28 existed. In the 1970s and 1980s, as climate science was evolving and our understanding of the impacts that human activities were having on greenhouse gas emissions, scientists were using different temperature thresholds to understand the potential impacts of these emissions (Nordhaus 1975). These thresholds usually ranged from 1-2\u00b0C.\nAs the international community has come together to address climate change, it became important to have an agreed upon temperature target as a catalyst for climate action When the first international climate treaty was negotiated in 1992, Parties agreed to stabilize \u201cgreenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.\u201d In 2010, the Cancun Agreement further recognized the need \u201cto hold the increase in global average temperature below 2\u00b0C above preindustrial levels\u201d.\nHowever, research continued to show that for some countries and vulnerable ecosystems, the risk of grave damage rapidly increases at less than 2\u00b0C of warming. So in 2015, nearly the entire world (195 nations) came together at the United Nations-held international climate meeting COP21 to sign the Paris Agreement.

We need to move swiftly to a low-carbon society, but it will require an enormous effort.\n\nFull Page Content:\nUN Climate Change News, 26 October 2022 \u2013 A new report from UN Climate Change shows countries are bending the curve of global greenhouse gas emissions downward but underlines that these efforts remain insufficient to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. According to the report, the combined climate pledges of 193 Parties under the Paris Agreement could put the world on track for around 2.5 degrees Celsius of warming by the end of the century. Today\u2019s report also shows current commitments will increase emissions by 10.6% by 2030, compared to 2010 levels. This is an improvement over last year\u2019s assessment, which found countries were on a path to increase emissions by 13.7% by 2030, compared to 2010 levels. Last year\u2019s analysis showed projected emissions would continue to increase beyond 2030. However, this year's analysis shows that while emissions are no longer increasing after 2030, they are still not demonstrating the rapid downward trend science says is necessary this decade. The UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s 2018 report indicated that CO2 emissions needed to be cut 45% by 2030, compared to 2010 levels. The latest science from the IPCC released earlier this year uses 2019 as a baseline, indicating that GHG emissions need to be cut 43% by 2030. This is critical to meeting the Paris Agreement goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of this century and avoiding the worst impacts of climate change, including more frequent and severe droughts, heatwaves and rainfall. \u201cThe downward trend in emissions expected by 2030 shows that nations have made some progress this year,\u201d said Simon Stiell, Executive Secretary of UN Climate Change. \u201cBut the science is clear and so are our climate goals under the Paris Agreement. We are still nowhere near the scale and pace of emission reductions required to put us on track toward a 1.5 degrees Celsius world. To keep this goal alive, national governments need to strengthen their climate action plans now and implement them in the next eight years.\u201d UN Climate Change analyzed the climate action plans \u2013 known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) \u2013 of 193 Parties to the Paris Agreement, including 24 updated or new NDCs submitted after the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow (COP 26) up until 23 September 2022. Taken together, the plans cover 94.9% of total global greenhouse gas emissions in 2019. \u201cAt the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow last year, all countries agreed to revisit and strengthen their climate plans,\u201d said Stiell. \u201cThe fact that only 24 new or updated climate plans were submitted since COP 26 is disappointing. Government decisions and actions must reflect the level of urgency, the gravity of the threats we are facing, and the shortness of the time we have remaining to avoid the devastating consequences of runaway climate change.\u201d This is UN Climate Change\u2019s second such report, providing a critical update to last year\u2019s inaugural NDC synthesis report. While the overall findings of the report are stark, there are glimmers of hope. Most of the Parties that submitted new or updated NDCs have strengthened their commitment to reducing or limiting greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 and/or 2030, demonstrating increased ambition in addressing climate change. A second UN Climate Change report on long-term low-emission development strategies, also released today, looked at countries\u2019 plans to transition to net-zero emissions by or around mid-century. The report indicated that these countries\u2019 greenhouse gas emissions could be roughly 68% per cent lower in 2050 than in 2019, if all the long-term strategies are fully implemented on time. Current long-term strategies (representing 62 Parties to the Paris Agreement) account for 83% of the world\u2019s GDP, 47% of global population in 2019, and around 69% of total energy consumption in 2019. This is a strong signal that the world is starting to aim for net-zero emissions. The report notes, however, that many net-zero targets remain uncertain and postpone into the future critical action that needs to take place now. Ambitious climate action before 2030 is urgently needed to achieve the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement. With the UN Climate Change Conference (COP 27) just around the corner, Stiell called on governments to revisit their climate plans and make them stronger in order to close the gap between where emissions are heading and where science indicates they should be this decade. \u201cCOP 27 is the moment where global leaders can regain momentum on climate change, make the necessary pivot from negotiations to implementation and get moving on the massive transformation that must take place throughout all sectors of society to address the climate emergency,\u201d he said. Stiell is urging national governments to come to COP 27 to show how they will put the Paris Agreement to work in their home countries through legislation, policies and programs, as well as how they will cooperate and provide support for implementation. He is also calling for nations to make progress at COP 27 in four priority areas: mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage, and finance. \u201cCOP27 will be the world's watershed moment on climate action,\u201d said Sameh Shoukry, Egyptian Minister of Foreign Affairs and COP27 President-Designate. \u201cThe report from UN Climate Change and before that from the IPCC are a timely reminder for all of us. Raising ambition and urgent implementation is indispensable for addressing the climate crisis. This includes cutting and removing emissions faster and at wider scope of economic sectors, to protect us from more severe adverse climate impacts and devastating loss and damage.\u201d \"The synthesis report is a testimony to the fact that we are off-track on achieving the Paris Climate Goal and keeping the 1.5 degrees within reach,\u201d added Shoukry. \u201cThis is a sobering moment, and we are in a race against time.

Wylde, shows numerous industrial chimneys in the town of Manchester, England, which earned the nickname \"Cottonopolis,\" following its transformation. Image in the public domain, from Wikimedia.\nWhen you read or hear climate numbers, they are often being compared to average. The September 2023 NOAA global surface temperatures, for instance, were 1.44 degrees Celsius above average. That average represents a defined period of time. In this case, September was 1.44\u00b0C warmer than the average September of the twentieth century.\nFor the 1.5\u00b0C climate threshold, the \u201caverage\u201d time range is defined as the \u201cpre-industrial period\u201d, or the period of time before the increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases due to human-emissions began to significantly influence global temperatures. Sounds a bit vague, right? What years make up this \u201cpre-industrial period?\u201d It depends.\nMost history books define the dates of the Industrial Revolution as between the mid-1700s and mid-1800s, but scientific definitions of pre-industrial typically cover some range of decades between 1850 and 1900. Why? Because that\u2019s the earliest time period with widespread, consistent surface temperature records. Different research groups use different parts of the broader time range. For NOAA data, we currently define pre-industrial as 1850-1900. (Footnote 1)\nWhile there can be differences in what counts as \u201cpre-industrial\u201d, it's important to remember that industrial versus pre-industrial is really about the human signature on our climate and how scientists can distinguish that from natural variability going back thousands of years. (Footnote 2)\nHow far the global temperature is above average depends on how you define average. For NOAA's global temperature dataset, \"pre-industrial\" is defined as the period from 1850-1900. For routine monthly reports, NOAA compares monthly temperatures to the 20th-century average. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from NCEI.\nAdding to the nuance, global surface temperature itself can potentially refer to different temperature variables measured in different ways. On land, thermometer-measured temperature variables can include readings at both at the literal ground surface and at two meters above. Over water, ships and buoys can measure the surface ocean temperature directly as well as the air temperature two meters above the water. From high above, satellites don\u2019t directly measure temperatures, but scientists derive land surface and atmospheric temperatures based on the amount of thermal and microwave energy satellites receive.\nSuffice to say, there are a lot of ways of measuring temperatures. And THEN there are different ways of combining those observations into a global dataset. (Despite these differences, all major temperature records show a similar long-term warming trend.) When NOAA releases the latest monthly climate statistics, it uses the NOAA Global Surface Temperature (NOAAGlobalTemp) dataset which blends in-ocean sea surface temperatures and 2-meter air temperatures.\nSo, when you come across stories about the 1.5\u00b0C threshold\u2014especially if you think you\u2019re seeing contradictory stories about whether we have or haven\u2019t reached 1.5\u00b0C\u2014 you should ask yourself three questions. 1) What is the dataset? 2) What is the \u201cpre-industrial\u201d time period? 3) What kind of temperature is being used? Those are the details you need to be able to put that story into context and compare it to other sources of information.\nLet\u2019s go back in time before large international climate conferences like COP28 existed. In the 1970s and 1980s, as climate science was evolving and our understanding of the impacts that human activities were having on greenhouse gas emissions, scientists were using different temperature thresholds to understand the potential impacts of these emissions (Nordhaus 1975). These thresholds usually ranged from 1-2\u00b0C.\nAs the international community has come together to address climate change, it became important to have an agreed upon temperature target as a catalyst for climate action When the first international climate treaty was negotiated in 1992, Parties agreed to stabilize \u201cgreenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.\u201d In 2010, the Cancun Agreement further recognized the need \u201cto hold the increase in global average temperature below 2\u00b0C above preindustrial levels\u201d.\nHowever, research continued to show that for some countries and vulnerable ecosystems, the risk of grave damage rapidly increases at less than 2\u00b0C of warming.

A second UN Climate Change report on long-term low-emission development strategies, also released today, looked at countries\u2019 plans to transition to net-zero emissions by or around mid-century. The report indicated that these countries\u2019 greenhouse gas emissions could be roughly 68% per cent lower in 2050 than in 2019, if all the long-term strategies are fully implemented on time. Current long-term strategies (representing 62 Parties to the Paris Agreement) account for 83% of the world\u2019s GDP, 47% of global population in 2019, and around 69% of total energy consumption in 2019. This is a strong signal that the world is starting to aim for net-zero emissions. The report notes, however, that many net-zero targets remain uncertain and postpone into the future critical action that needs to take place now. Ambitious climate action before 2030 is urgently needed to achieve the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement.

Human activity is the principal cause.\n\nFull Page Content:\nThere is unequivocal evidence that Earth is warming at an unprecedented rate. Human activity is the principal cause.\nEarth's climate has changed throughout history. Just in the last 800,000 years, there have been eight cycles of ice ages and warmer periods, with the end of the last ice age about 11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era \u2014 and of human civilization. Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth\u2019s orbit that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives.\nThe current warming trend is different because it is clearly the result of human activities since the mid-1800s, and is proceeding at a rate not seen over many recent millennia.1 It is undeniable that human activities have produced the atmospheric gases that have trapped more of the Sun\u2019s energy in the Earth system. This extra energy has warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land, and widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred.\nEarth-orbiting satellites and new technologies have helped scientists see the big picture, collecting many different types of information about our planet and its climate all over the world. These data, collected over many years, reveal the signs and patterns of a changing climate.\nScientists demonstrated the heat-trapping nature of carbon dioxide and other gases in the mid-19th century.2 Many of the science instruments NASA uses to study our climate focus on how these gases affect the movement of infrared radiation through the atmosphere. From the measured impacts of increases in these gases, there is no question that increased greenhouse gas levels warm Earth in response.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nIce cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that Earth\u2019s climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly 10 times faster than the average rate of warming after an ice age. Carbon dioxide from human activities is increasing about 250 times faster than it did from natural sources after the last Ice Age.3\nThe planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and other human activities.4 Most of the warming occurred in the past 40 years, with the seven most recent years being the warmest.

Human activity is the principal cause.\nEarth's climate has changed throughout history. Just in the last 800,000 years, there have been eight cycles of ice ages and warmer periods, with the end of the last ice age about 11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era \u2014 and of human civilization. Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth\u2019s orbit that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives.\nThe current warming trend is different because it is clearly the result of human activities since the mid-1800s, and is proceeding at a rate not seen over many recent millennia.1 It is undeniable that human activities have produced the atmospheric gases that have trapped more of the Sun\u2019s energy in the Earth system. This extra energy has warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land, and widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred.\nEarth-orbiting satellites and new technologies have helped scientists see the big picture, collecting many different types of information about our planet and its climate all over the world. These data, collected over many years, reveal the signs and patterns of a changing climate.\nScientists demonstrated the heat-trapping nature of carbon dioxide and other gases in the mid-19th century.2 Many of the science instruments NASA uses to study our climate focus on how these gases affect the movement of infrared radiation through the atmosphere. From the measured impacts of increases in these gases, there is no question that increased greenhouse gas levels warm Earth in response.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nIce cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that Earth\u2019s climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly 10 times faster than the average rate of warming after an ice age. Carbon dioxide from human activities is increasing about 250 times faster than it did from natural sources after the last Ice Age.3\nThe planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and other human activities.4 Most of the warming occurred in the past 40 years, with the seven most recent years being the warmest.

The planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2.12\u00b0 Fahrenheit (1.18\u00b0 Celsius) since the late 19th century, and 10 of the warmest years on record(link is external) have been observed since 2014.\nIn its Sixth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that it is unequivocal that the increase of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) in the atmosphere over the industrial era is the result of human activities and that human influence is the principal driver of many changes observed across the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere.\nLife on Earth depends on energy from the Sun. About half the light energy reaching Earth's atmosphere passes through the air and clouds to the surface, where it is absorbed and radiated in the form of infrared heat. Nearly 90% of this heat is then absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-radiated, slowing heat loss to space. GHGs include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), ozone (O3), and water vapor (H2O).\nRemotely sensed greenhouse gas data, such as the data collected by NASA\u2019s Earth-observing satellites, are used in atmospheric models to estimate the sources and sinks of these gases. These data allow researchers to pinpoint sources and hotspots of greenhouse gases across the globe. NASA also curates socioeconomic data to shed light on the health impacts of greenhouse gas emissions on people and communities. The U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center(link is external) is a joint effort between NASA and other U.S. government agencies to open up access to trusted data on greenhouse gases.\nAccess a range of datasets and data tools to further your research in industrial emissions and greenhouse gases.\nWhile NASA data are openly available without restriction, an Earthdata Login is required to download data and to use some tools with full functionality.\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\nOur online forum provides a space for users to browse thousands of FAQs about research needs, data, and data applications.

The past ten years have all been in the Top Ten, in an extraordinary streak of record-breaking temperatures.\nThe global average surface temperature was 1.55 \u00b0C (with a margin of uncertainty of \u00b1 0.13 \u00b0C) above the 1850-1900 average, according to WMO\u2019s consolidated analysis of the six datasets. This means that we have likely just experienced the first calendar year with a global mean temperature of more than 1.5\u00b0C above the 1850-1900 average.\n\u201cToday\u2019s assessment from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) proves yet again \u2013 global heating is a cold, hard fact,\u201d said UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3no Guterres.\n\u201cIndividual years pushing past the 1.5 degree limit do not mean the long-term goal is shot. It means we need to fight even harder to get on track. Blazing temperatures in 2024 require trail-blazing climate action in 2025,\u201d he said. \u201cThere's still time to avoid the worst of climate catastrophe. But leaders must act \u2013 now,\u201d he said.\nThe WMO provides a temperature assessment based on multiple sources of data to support international climate monitoring and to provide authoritative information for the UN Climate Change negotiating process. The datasets are from the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), Japan Meteorological Agency, NASA, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the UK\u2019s Met Office in collaboration with the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia (HadCRUT), and Berkeley Earth.\n\u201cClimate history is playing out before our eyes. We\u2019ve had not just one or two record-breaking years, but a full ten-year series. This has been accompanied by devastating and extreme weather, rising sea levels and melting ice, all powered by record-breaking greenhouse gas levels due to human activities,\u201d said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo.\n\u201cIt is important to emphasize that a single year of more than 1.5\u00b0C for a year does NOT mean that we have failed to meet Paris Agreement long-term temperature goals, which are measured over decades rather than an individual year. However, it is essential to recognize that every fraction of a degree of warming matters. Whether it is at a level below or above 1.5\u00b0C of warming, every additional increment of global warming increases the impacts on our lives, economies and our planet,\u201d said Celeste Saulo.\nThere is a margin of uncertainty in all temperature assessments. All six datasets place 2024 as the warmest year on record and all highlight the recent rate of warming. But not all show the temperature anomaly above 1.5 \u00b0C due to differing methodologies.\nThe timing of the release of the six temperature datasets was coordinated across the institutions in order to underline the exceptional conditions experienced during 2024.\nA separate study published in Advances in Atmospheric Sciences found that ocean warming in 2024 played a key role in the record high temperatures. The ocean is the warmest it has ever been as recorded by humans, not only at the surface but also for the upper 2000 meters, according to the study led by Prof. Lijing Cheng with the Institute of Atmospheric Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It involved a team of 54 scientists from seven countries and 31 institutes.\nAbout 90% of the excess heat from global warming is stored in the ocean, making ocean heat content a critical indicator of climate change. From 2023 to 2024, the global upper 2000 m ocean heat content increase is 16 zettajoules (1021 Joules), about 140 times the world\u2019s total electricity generation in 2023, according to the study, which is based on the Insitute of Atmospheric Physics dataset.\nWMO will provide full details of key climate change indicators, including greenhouse gases, surface temperatures, ocean heat, sea level rise, glacier retreat and sea ice extent, in its State of the Global Climate 2024 report to be issued in March 2025. This will also give details of high-impact events.\nMr Guterres called on governments to deliver new national climate action plans this year to limit long-term global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C, and support the most vulnerable deal with devastating climate impacts.\nOne or more individual years exceeding 1.5\u00b0C does not mean that we have missed the goal of \u201cholding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change\u201d as stated in the Paris Agreement. This refers to an extended period, typically decades or longer, although the Agreement itself does not provide a specific definition.\nShort-term temperature spikes in long-term warming can be caused by naturally occurring phenomena like El Ni\u00f1o, which persisted from mid-2023 to May 2024.\nAs global warming continues, there is an urgent need for careful tracking, monitoring and communication with regard to where the warming is relative to the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement, to help policymakers in their deliberations.\nAn international team of experts established by WMO has given an initial indication that long-term global warming as assessed in 2024 is currently about 1.3\u00b0C compared to the 1850-1900 baseline.\nWMO uses datasets based on climatological data from observing sites and ships and buoys in global marine networks, developed and maintained by the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (NASA GISS), the United Kingdom\u2019s Met Office Hadley Centre and the University of East Anglia\u2019s Climatic Research Unit (HadCRUT), and the Berkeley Earth group.\nWMO also uses reanalysis datasets from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and its Copernicus Climate Change Service, and the Japan Meteor\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

But even ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nExpected but sobering.\nThat is how experts are describing the findings of a new United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) report that says that global temperatures are on track to exceed the most ambitious end of the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement.\nModeling from UNEP\u2019s Emissions Gap Report 2025, released on Tuesday, found that within the next decade, global temperatures will likely exceed 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. Climate advocates had long hoped that it would be decades, if ever, before the 1.5\u00b0C threshold was breached. Keeping the global average temperature below that level is considered crucial for avoiding some of the worst effects of climate change.\n\u201cDespite all the warnings, the world has continued to emit greenhouse gasses at record levels, so this conclusion wasn\u2019t unexpected,\u201d said Martin Krause, Director of UNEP\u2019s Climate Change Division. \u201cBut it should be a wakeup call to everyone. Climate change is real, it\u2019s happening and unless we do something about it soon, the consequences will be severe.\u201d\nHow did the world get here and what does overshooting 1.5\u00b0C mean for humanity? Let\u2019s dive into the Emissions Gap Report to answer those and other questions.\nIt\u2019s been more than a decade since the Paris Agreement was signed. Why are we still facing a climate catastrophe?\nDespite the agreement, humanity continues to burn fossil fuels and pump out greenhouse gasses at a record rate. In 2024 these emissions \u2013 which act like a blanket, trapping heat near the Earth\u2019s surface \u2013 jumped over 2 per cent. That continues a steady increase dating back more than a century. There is now more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere than at any point in at least the last 2 million years.\nHow hot could the planet get?\nEven if countries live up to their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 and that\u2019s a big \u201cif\u201d \u2013 the world will warm by 2.3\u00b0C to 2.5\u00b0C by the end of the century, the Emissions Gap Report estimates. That\u2019s a slight improvement from last year\u2019s forecast. But it\u2019s still more than enough to destabilize delicate climate systems, leading to a surge in droughts, floods, superstorms and other extreme weather.\nWhen the Paris Agreement was adopted in 2015, experts calculated the world was on pace to warm by 3\u00b0C to 3.5\u00b0C based on countries\u2019 mitigation pledges \u2014 a potentially catastrophic path. Thanks to the commitments it inspired, that projection has fallen by about a full degree showing that global climate action can make a real difference.\nIn 2024, the Earth\u2019s average temperature was reportedly 1.5\u00b0C warmer than in pre-industrial times. So, what\u2019s new about the Emissions Gap Report\u2019s findings?\nIt\u2019s true that in 2024, the Earth did surpass 1.5\u00b0C of warming. But when researchers look at the global temperature, they try not to put too much stock into what happens in any single year. Instead, they look at the average temperature over decades, which smooths out random variations. This year\u2019s Emissions Gap Report finds this so-called \u201cmulti-decadal average\u201d will at least temporarily surpass 1.5\u00b0C in the next 10 years.\nIs there any chance of keeping warming below 1.5\u00b0C?\nTechnically, yes, but the odds of that happening are slim. The Emissions Gap Report found that greenhouse gas emissions would have to fall roughly by 55 per cent by 2035 to align with the 1.5\u00b0C pathway well above what countries have promised. A more achievable, though still difficult, goal is limiting warming to 2\u00b0C, which would require emissions to drop around 35 per cent by 2035. Current national commitments, if fully implemented, would cut emissions only 12 to 15 per cent by that date \u2014 leaving the world well off target.\nSo, what happens now that the world seems likely to overshoot the 1.5\u00b0C threshold?\nThe key is to keep this exceedance, as researchers call it, as minimal and as short-lived as possible. The report plotted a scenario where temperatures rise to about 1.8\u00b0C before falling back below 1.5\u00b0C before the end of the century. But even that will be challenging, it concedes. Still, the world can\u2019t stop trying, Krause said.\n\u201cEvery fraction of a degree of warming we avoid means climate change will be less severe.\n\u201cIf we buckle down, we can still potentially save lives, spare economies and prevent the world from reaching devastating climatic tipping points.\u201d\nSo, what needs to happen to get the world back on track?\nFirst and foremost, humanity needs to break its addiction to fossil fuels and ramp up the production of renewable energy. Doing that will require the leadership of the Group of 20 nations, which account for about three-quarters of greenhouse gas emissions and, collectively, are not on track to achieve their climate pledges. It also means more financial support for developing countries and an overhaul of the global financial architecture.\nIs there any good news on the climate front?\nYes. In the decade since the Paris Agreement was signed, we\u2019ve seen a surge in the use of renewable energy, buoyed in large part by plummeting costs. That has primed the world for a low-carbon future, marked by economic growth and energy security.\n\u201cWe have the technology and the know-how to end the climate crisis,\u201d says Krause. \u201cWhat we need now is the political will.\u201d\n\u00a9 2025 UNEP Terms of Use Privacy Report Project Concern Report Scam Contact Us\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The past ten years have all been in the Top Ten, in an extraordinary streak of record-breaking temperatures.\nThe global average surface temperature was 1.55 \u00b0C (with a margin of uncertainty of \u00b1 0.13 \u00b0C) above the 1850-1900 average, according to WMO\u2019s consolidated analysis of the six datasets. This means that we have likely just experienced the first calendar year with a global mean temperature of more than 1.5\u00b0C above the 1850-1900 average.\n\u201cToday\u2019s assessment from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) proves yet again \u2013 global heating is a cold, hard fact,\u201d said UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3no Guterres.\n\u201cIndividual years pushing past the 1.5 degree limit do not mean the long-term goal is shot. It means we need to fight even harder to get on track. Blazing temperatures in 2024 require trail-blazing climate action in 2025,\u201d he said. \u201cThere's still time to avoid the worst of climate catastrophe. But leaders must act \u2013 now,\u201d he said.\nThe WMO provides a temperature assessment based on multiple sources of data to support international climate monitoring and to provide authoritative information for the UN Climate Change negotiating process. The datasets are from the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), Japan Meteorological Agency, NASA, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the UK\u2019s Met Office in collaboration with the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia (HadCRUT), and Berkeley Earth.\n\u201cClimate history is playing out before our eyes. We\u2019ve had not just one or two record-breaking years, but a full ten-year series. This has been accompanied by devastating and extreme weather, rising sea levels and melting ice, all powered by record-breaking greenhouse gas levels due to human activities,\u201d said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo.\n\u201cIt is important to emphasize that a single year of more than 1.5\u00b0C for a year does NOT mean that we have failed to meet Paris Agreement long-term temperature goals, which are measured over decades rather than an individual year. However, it is essential to recognize that every fraction of a degree of warming matters. Whether it is at a level below or above 1.5\u00b0C of warming, every additional increment of global warming increases the impacts on our lives, economies and our planet,\u201d said Celeste Saulo.\nThere is a margin of uncertainty in all temperature assessments. All six datasets place 2024 as the warmest year on record and all highlight the recent rate of warming. But not all show the temperature anomaly above 1.5 \u00b0C due to differing methodologies.\nThe timing of the release of the six temperature datasets was coordinated across the institutions in order to underline the exceptional conditions experienced during 2024.\nA separate study published in Advances in Atmospheric Sciences found that ocean warming in 2024 played a key role in the record high temperatures. The ocean is the warmest it has ever been as recorded by humans, not only at the surface but also for the upper 2000 meters, according to the study led by Prof. Lijing Cheng with the Institute of Atmospheric Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It involved a team of 54 scientists from seven countries and 31 institutes.\nAbout 90% of the excess heat from global warming is stored in the ocean, making ocean heat content a critical indicator of climate change. From 2023 to 2024, the global upper 2000 m ocean heat content increase is 16 zettajoules (1021 Joules), about 140 times the world\u2019s total electricity generation in 2023, according to the study, which is based on the Insitute of Atmospheric Physics dataset.\nWMO will provide full details of key climate change indicators, including greenhouse gases, surface temperatures, ocean heat, sea level rise, glacier retreat and sea ice extent, in its State of the Global Climate 2024 report to be issued in March 2025. This will also give details of high-impact events.\nMr Guterres called on governments to deliver new national climate action plans this year to limit long-term global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C, and support the most vulnerable deal with devastating climate impacts.\nOne or more individual years exceeding 1.5\u00b0C does not mean that we have missed the goal of \u201cholding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change\u201d as stated in the Paris Agreement. This refers to an extended period, typically decades or longer, although the Agreement itself does not provide a specific definition.\nShort-term temperature spikes in long-term warming can be caused by naturally occurring phenomena like El Ni\u00f1o, which persisted from mid-2023 to May 2024.\nAs global warming continues, there is an urgent need for careful tracking, monitoring and communication with regard to where the warming is relative to the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement, to help policymakers in their deliberations.\nAn international team of experts established by WMO has given an initial indication that long-term global warming as assessed in 2024 is currently about 1.3\u00b0C compared to the 1850-1900 baseline.\nWMO uses datasets based on climatological data from observing sites and ships and buoys in global marine networks, developed and maintained by the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (NASA GISS), the United Kingdom\u2019s Met Office Hadley Centre and the University of East Anglia\u2019s Climatic Research Unit (HadCRUT), and the Berkeley Earth group.\nWMO also uses reanalysis datasets from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and its Copernicus Climate Change Service, and the Japan Meteor\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Climate advocates had long hoped that it would be decades, if ever, before the 1.5\u00b0C threshold was breached. Keeping the global average temperature below that level is considered crucial for avoiding some of the worst effects of climate change.\n\u201cDespite all the warnings, the world has continued to emit greenhouse gasses at record levels, so this conclusion wasn\u2019t unexpected,\u201d said Martin Krause, Director of UNEP\u2019s Climate Change Division. \u201cBut it should be a wakeup call to everyone. Climate change is real, it\u2019s happening and unless we do something about it soon, the consequences will be severe.\u201d\nHow did the world get here and what does overshooting 1.5\u00b0C mean for humanity? Let\u2019s dive into the Emissions Gap Report to answer those and other questions.\nIt\u2019s been more than a decade since the Paris Agreement was signed. Why are we still facing a climate catastrophe?\nDespite the agreement, humanity continues to burn fossil fuels and pump out greenhouse gasses at a record rate. In 2024 these emissions \u2013 which act like a blanket, trapping heat near the Earth\u2019s surface \u2013 jumped over 2 per cent. That continues a steady increase dating back more than a century. There is now more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere than at any point in at least the last 2 million years.\nHow hot could the planet get?\nEven if countries live up to their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 and that\u2019s a big \u201cif\u201d \u2013 the world will warm by 2.3\u00b0C to 2.5\u00b0C by the end of the century, the Emissions Gap Report estimates. That\u2019s a slight improvement from last year\u2019s forecast. But it\u2019s still more than enough to destabilize delicate climate systems, leading to a surge in droughts, floods, superstorms and other extreme weather.\nWhen the Paris Agreement was adopted in 2015, experts calculated the world was on pace to warm by 3\u00b0C to 3.5\u00b0C based on countries\u2019 mitigation pledges \u2014 a potentially catastrophic path. Thanks to the commitments it inspired, that projection has fallen by about a full degree showing that global climate action can make a real difference.\nIn 2024, the Earth\u2019s average temperature was reportedly 1.5\u00b0C warmer than in pre-industrial times. So, what\u2019s new about the Emissions Gap Report\u2019s findings?\nIt\u2019s true that in 2024, the Earth did surpass 1.5\u00b0C of warming. But when researchers look at the global temperature, they try not to put too much stock into what happens in any single year. Instead, they look at the average temperature over decades, which smooths out random variations. This year\u2019s Emissions Gap Report finds this so-called \u201cmulti-decadal average\u201d will at least temporarily surpass 1.5\u00b0C in the next 10 years.\nIs there any chance of keeping warming below 1.5\u00b0C?\nTechnically, yes, but the odds of that happening are slim. The Emissions Gap Report found that greenhouse gas emissions would have to fall roughly by 55 per cent by 2035 to align with the 1.5\u00b0C pathway well above what countries have promised. A more achievable, though still difficult, goal is limiting warming to 2\u00b0C, which would require emissions to drop around 35 per cent by 2035. Current national commitments, if fully implemented, would cut emissions only 12 to 15 per cent by that date \u2014 leaving the world well off target.\nSo, what happens now that the world seems likely to overshoot the 1.5\u00b0C threshold?\nThe key is to keep this exceedance, as researchers call it, as minimal and as short-lived as possible. The report plotted a scenario where temperatures rise to about 1.8\u00b0C before falling back below 1.5\u00b0C before the end of the century. But even that will be challenging, it concedes. Still, the world can\u2019t stop trying, Krause said.\n\u201cEvery fraction of a degree of warming we avoid means climate change will be less severe.\n\u201cIf we buckle down, we can still potentially save lives, spare economies and prevent the world from reaching devastating climatic tipping points.\u201d\nSo, what needs to happen to get the world back on track?\nFirst and foremost, humanity needs to break its addiction to fossil fuels and ramp up the production of renewable energy. Doing that will require the leadership of the Group of 20 nations, which account for about three-quarters of greenhouse gas emissions and, collectively, are not on track to achieve their climate pledges. It also means more financial support for developing countries and an overhaul of the global financial architecture.\nIs there any good news on the climate front?\nYes. In the decade since the Paris Agreement was signed, we\u2019ve seen a surge in the use of renewable energy, buoyed in large part by plummeting costs. That has primed the world for a low-carbon future, marked by economic growth and energy security.\n\u201cWe have the technology and the know-how to end the climate crisis,\u201d says Krause. \u201cWhat we need now is the political will.\u201d\n\u00a9 2025 UNEP Terms of Use Privacy Report Project Concern Report Scam Contact Us\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Information.\nAccording to the annual report from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, 2024 was the warmest year since global records began in 1850. The global average surface temperature was 2.32 Fahrenheit (1.29 degrees Celsius) above the 20th-century average (57.0 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.9 degrees Celsius) and 2.63 degrees Fahrenheit (1.46 degrees Celsius) above the pre-industrial average (56.7 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.7 degrees Celsius), which NOAA defines as the period from 1850-1900.\nGlobal temperatures in 2024 were above the 1991-2020 average (red) across most of the planet. Yearly temperatures compared to the 20th-century average (bar chart) show that it has been 48 years since Earth had a cooler-than-average year. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe 2024 global temperature anomaly (anomaly means \u201cdifference from average\u201d) is 0.18 degrees F (0.10 degrees C) warmer than the previous record, set the year before, in 2023. The ten warmest years in the 175-year record have all occurred during the last decade (2015\u20132024). When the new century started in 2000, the first year to set a new high-temperature record was 2005. Now, 2005 is just the 13th-warmest year on record.\nOther 2024 rankings included...\nFor more regional details and 2024 climate statistics, see the 2024 Global Climate Report from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe global average surface temperature is an indicator of the state of Earth\u2019s energy balance: how much sunlight it absorbs minus how much heat it radiates back to space. When these amounts are the same, Earth\u2019s average surface temperature remains steady. When they are out of balance, Earth cools or warms. Earth\u2019s average surface temperature has been rising because human-produced greenhouse gases are causing Earth to absorb more energy than it radiates back to space.\nGiven the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of added heat energy to raise Earth\u2019s average surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree-Fahrenheit (1-degree-Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1850-1900 in NOAA's record) might seem small, but it represents a significant increase in heat energy circulating through all parts of the Earth system, including the oceans, frozen landscapes, and the atmosphere.\nBeyond being an indicator of changes in Earth\u2019s energy balance, surface temperature matters because it controls many environmental and ecological processes that are important to humans and other life, including the water cycle (evaporation, clouds, surface water supplies, and precipitation), the carbon cycle, and the kinds of plants, animals, and other living things that can survive in different places on Earth.\nThe concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (55 degrees Celsius) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the \"average\" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget, which can only be directly measured from space.\nTo calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute temperature readings to temperature anomalies\u2014the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend.\nAcross inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and known physical relationships\u2014such as the way temperature decreases with altitude\u2014to estimate the missing values. Each value is then used to calculate a global-scale temperature anomaly. This process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in Earth's surface temperature over time. Read more about how the global surface temperature record is built in our Climate Data Primer.\nTemperature change has not been uniform across the planet, but more areas are warming than cooling. And the rate of warming has accelerated in recent decades. According to NOAA's 2024 Annual Climate Report the combined land and ocean temperature has warmed at an average rate of 0.11 degrees Fahrenheit (0.06 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1850 and more than three times that rate (0.36 degrees Fahrenheit, or 0.20 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1975.\nRecent rates of global warming (1994-2024, bottom) are larger than the longer-term average rates (1901-2024, top). Places that have cooled are colored blue; places that have warmed are colored yellow, orange, or red. In the past three decades, many places in the Northern Hemisphere have warmed by 1 degree Fahrenheit or more per decade. Differences are most dramatic in the Arctic. With the decline of ice and snow, the Arctic reflects less incoming sunlight, which amplifies the rate of greenhouse-gas-driven warming. NOAA Climate.gov, based o\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

But as climate change makes heat waves more intense and more frequent, we need to be cognizant of the dangers and health risks that come with it.\nOver the coming decades, every region of the US is expected to experience hotter temperatures and more frequent and intense heat waves. This worsening heat poses serious health risks, especially for the very young and elderly, construction and agricultural workers, and those living in the core of urban areas.\nThese two companion fact sheets summarize:\n\u201cHeat wave,\u201d \u201cexcessive heat event,\u201d \u201cheat advisory,\u201d \u201chot spell\u201d\u2014extreme heat has many different names but generally refers to temperatures that are either exceptionally high relative to typical local conditions or reach levels that may be harmful to human health or infrastructure. When extreme daytime temperatures persist over a prolonged period (usually at least two days), it is often referred to as a heat wave.\nThe human body sweats to cool itself when exposed to high temperatures. In humid conditions, sweat does not evaporate as quickly and the body\u2019s ability to cool itself is compromised. Heat stress can result and, if not addressed, can lead to heat-related illnesses like heat exhaustion and heat stroke. The impacts of temperature extremes on human health and well-being are therefore generally considered in concert with humidity to measure heat stress conditions: those in which the human body has difficulty cooling itself.\nExtreme heat events can be measured in a few different ways: the maximum temperatures hit (intensity), how often the events occur (frequency), or how long they last (duration). The Dust Bowl era of the 1930s holds the record for peak frequency, intensity, and duration of heat waves across much of the United States to this day\u2014but the frequency and intensity of heat waves have increased in the last several decades in many regions.\nIn addition to changes in extreme temperatures alone, studies of heat stress trends over the late 20th to early 21st century found increases across much of the country in the conditions that cause heat stress for humans. In a study of changes in extreme heat stress conditions at 187 weather stations across the US between 1949 and 2005, 20 percent of the stations had recorded a substantial increase in the number of one-day, extreme heat stress events (relative to local conditions between 1961 and 1990). On average, these stations recorded 12 more days with extreme heat stress per year in 2005 than they did in 1949.\nIn the next few decades, if carbon emissions continue to grow, most of the country could see 20 to 30 more days annually with maximum temperatures above 90 degrees Fahrenheit. The Southeast could be hit even harder, potentially enduring 40 to 50 more such days.\nBy 2100, all parts of the United States are likely to experience more heat waves, with the Southeast, Southwest, and Alaska likely to see the biggest increases. Not only will these heat waves be more frequent, they will also be hotter than what we experience today. If carbon emissions continue to increase substantially, the hottest daily temperatures that occur in a given year in the United States are likely to increase by at least 10\u00b0F as compared to the end of the 20th century.\nHeat is among the deadliest extreme weather hazards in the United States. When exposure to heat is high enough to raise the body's core temperature, heat stress illness\u2014which encompasses heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke\u2014can occur.\nWith heat cramps, an individual experiences muscle pain or spasms. Heat exhaustion can cause dizziness, a weak pulse, nausea, and fainting. The most severe heat-related illness, heat stroke, occurs when a person\u2019s temperature increases above 103\u00b0F. Increased daily air temperatures or periods of extended high temperatures have also been shown to increase cardiovascular mortality, respiratory mortality, and heart attacks.\nSome US residents are at greater risk of adverse health effects and death from extreme heat. Low-income residents, the young and elderly, construction and agricultural workers, individuals with pre-existing medical conditions, and people living in the center of urban areas can be more vulnerable to physical harm from heat.\nExtreme heat can affect many aspects of daily life and routines, including:\nBy stabilizing global carbon emissions in the next few decades (so that atmospheric carbon dioxide remains below 550 parts per million by 2100), the frequency of heat waves the US is likely to see around mid-century would be reduced by approximately 50 percent, compared to a scenario in which carbon emissions continue to increase rapidly through to 2100.\nIf the global community pursues aggressive emissions reductions in line with the Paris Agreement goal of keeping warming below 3.6\u00b0F, the hottest daily temperatures that occur each year in many parts of the country are likely to increase by just 3.6\u00b0F instead of by 10\u00b0F, as compared to the higher-emissions scenario.\nIndividuals and communities need policies and infrastructure that take better account of more frequent, intense, and longer-lasting extreme heat. For example, in the coming decades increased reliance on air conditioning to cope with extreme heat is likely to contribute to increased global warming emissions, worsening air quality, and an increase in air pollution\u2013related mortality unless we more aggressively invest in clean energy technology, energy conservation, and energy efficiency measures.\nExisting policies also need to be leveraged and new policies enacted to better help people\u2014particularly outdoor workers, children, low-income and minority groups, elderly people, and athletes\u2014to cope with extreme heat. Policies that ensure the safety of all outdoor workers, documented or otherwise, and expand access to and awareness of \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Since then, the \u201c1.5C goal\u201d has become the world\u2019s North Star for climate action \u2014 a critical benchmark against which policies are set and progress is measured. But an alarming wave of recent data underscores just how close we are to surpassing this widely cited threshold.\nAtmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide reached its highest level in 2 million years last year. 2024 also marked the first single year in which global average surface temperature rose more than 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. While the Paris Agreement goal refers to a long-term average, not a single year, scientists warn that we may be at the beginning of a full breach \u2014 and with it, increasingly dangerous floods, droughts, fires and other climate impacts.\nSo what exactly is the 1.5 degrees C goal, how was it set, and what happens if we exceed it? Here\u2019s what to know.\nThe Paris Agreement\u2019s 1.5 degrees C temperature goal reflects decades of interaction between climate science and climate politics.\nThe UN\u2019s 1992 Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the world\u2019s first international treaty to confront the climate crisis, did not specify a temperature limit. A temperature goal emerged later, as scientific assessments, the European Council, and the G8 initially converged on a benchmark of 2 degrees C (3.6 degrees F) above pre-industrial levels. The 2010 Cancun Agreements became the first global agreements to reference 2 degrees C, while also recognizing the potential for a stronger 1.5 degrees C limit.\nIn the lead-up to the 2015 Paris Agreement, experts concluded that even 2 degrees C of warming posed severe risks. The Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs) pushed hard during the agreement\u2019s negotiations for a more stringent limit, resulting in a compromise: Countries agreed to collectively limit warming to \u201cwell below 2 degrees C\u201d and \u201cpursue efforts\u201d to limit it to 1.5 degrees C, reflecting growing recognition of the heightened risks from every fraction of a degree of temperature rise.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the world\u2019s pre-eminent group of climate scientists, then prepared a report on the 1.5 degrees C goal. They found a stark contrast in climate change impacts under 1.5 vs. 2 degrees C of warming. They also mapped what it would take to stay within the 1.5 degrees C limit.\nSince its adoption in the 2015 Paris Agreement, the 1.5 degrees C goal has served both as a powerful rhetorical symbol and as the basis for concrete technical benchmarks.\nVulnerable countries, NGOs and diplomats alike invoke the 1.5 degrees C goal to highlight what\u2019s at stake in UN climate negotiations and other policy decisions. Climate-vulnerable nations like small island states have long framed 1.5 degrees C as a matter of survival, popularized in the phrase \u201c1.5 to stay alive.\u201d Youth movements and UN leaders, including Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, have repeatedly called for urgent action to keep 1.5 degrees C \u201cwithin reach.\u201d\nTechnically, the 1.5 degrees C goal underpins a range of benchmarks and scientific assessments of climate action. It\u2019s used to evaluate the ambition of countries\u2019 national climate commitments (known as \u201cnationally determined contributions\u201d (NDCs)) and corporate emissions-reduction targets. It helps scientists estimate the remaining carbon budget \u2014 the amount of CO2 the world can still emit while limiting warming to 1.5 degrees C. The 1.5 degrees C-aligned pathways assessed by the IPCC form the basis for emissions-reduction timelines (such as the widely cited global benchmark of reducing emissions 43% below 2019 levels by 2030), deadlines for reaching net-zero emissions, and sector-specific targets like phasing out coal or replacing fossil-fueled vehicles with electric ones.\nThese timelines and benchmarks, in turn, underpin accountability tools like the Emissions Gap Report, the Science-Based Targets Initiative and the State of Climate Action report.\nThe Paris Agreement calls for \u201cholding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels.\u201d To know when we\u2019ve exceeded the threshold, it\u2019s important to define some terms:\nBy scientific convention, the Paris goal refers to a sustained temperature anomaly over a period of at least 20 years. This approach smooths out the effects of year-on-year temperature fluctuations due to factors like El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a, volcanic activity and changes in ocean circulation to provide a better estimate of human-caused warming. Scientists typically assess whether the long-term average exceeds 1.5 degrees C at any point during the 21st century, and specifically in 2100. If warming temporarily exceeds the threshold before falling back below it by the end of the century, this is referred to as \u201covershoot.\u201d\nUnder this approach, the year in which a given temperature threshold is breached is the middle year of the 20-year period. As WMO put it, \u201c1.5 degrees C of warming would only be confirmed once the observed temperature has reached that level over a 20-year period, 10 years after the year of exceedance. Thus, there would be a 10-year delay in recognizing and reacting to exceedance of the long-term temperature goal.\u201d The scientific community is considering alternative approaches that would require less delay to confirm the year of exceedance.\nYes, but it hasn\u2019t yet breached the Paris Agreement\u2019s temperature goal.\n2024 was the first full year on record in which the global average temperature was more than 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels, with an estimated anomaly of 1.55 degrees C. This continued an alarming pattern in which the 10 warmest years on record have all occurr\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The past ten years have all been in the Top Ten, in an extraordinary streak of record-breaking temperatures.\nThe global average surface temperature was 1.55 \u00b0C (with a margin of uncertainty of \u00b1 0.13 \u00b0C) above the 1850-1900 average, according to WMO\u2019s consolidated analysis of the six datasets. This means that we have likely just experienced the first calendar year with a global mean temperature of more than 1.5\u00b0C above the 1850-1900 average.\n\u201cToday\u2019s assessment from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) proves yet again \u2013 global heating is a cold, hard fact,\u201d said UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3no Guterres.\n\u201cIndividual years pushing past the 1.5 degree limit do not mean the long-term goal is shot. It means we need to fight even harder to get on track. Blazing temperatures in 2024 require trail-blazing climate action in 2025,\u201d he said. \u201cThere's still time to avoid the worst of climate catastrophe. But leaders must act \u2013 now,\u201d he said.\nThe WMO provides a temperature assessment based on multiple sources of data to support international climate monitoring and to provide authoritative information for the UN Climate Change negotiating process. The datasets are from the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), Japan Meteorological Agency, NASA, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the UK\u2019s Met Office in collaboration with the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia (HadCRUT), and Berkeley Earth.\n\u201cClimate history is playing out before our eyes. We\u2019ve had not just one or two record-breaking years, but a full ten-year series. This has been accompanied by devastating and extreme weather, rising sea levels and melting ice, all powered by record-breaking greenhouse gas levels due to human activities,\u201d said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo.\n\u201cIt is important to emphasize that a single year of more than 1.5\u00b0C for a year does NOT mean that we have failed to meet Paris Agreement long-term temperature goals, which are measured over decades rather than an individual year. However, it is essential to recognize that every fraction of a degree of warming matters. Whether it is at a level below or above 1.5\u00b0C of warming, every additional increment of global warming increases the impacts on our lives, economies and our planet,\u201d said Celeste Saulo.\nThere is a margin of uncertainty in all temperature assessments. All six datasets place 2024 as the warmest year on record and all highlight the recent rate of warming. But not all show the temperature anomaly above 1.5 \u00b0C due to differing methodologies.\nThe timing of the release of the six temperature datasets was coordinated across the institutions in order to underline the exceptional conditions experienced during 2024.\nA separate study published in Advances in Atmospheric Sciences found that ocean warming in 2024 played a key role in the record high temperatures. The ocean is the warmest it has ever been as recorded by humans, not only at the surface but also for the upper 2000 meters, according to the study led by Prof. Lijing Cheng with the Institute of Atmospheric Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It involved a team of 54 scientists from seven countries and 31 institutes.\nAbout 90% of the excess heat from global warming is stored in the ocean, making ocean heat content a critical indicator of climate change. From 2023 to 2024, the global upper 2000 m ocean heat content increase is 16 zettajoules (1021 Joules), about 140 times the world\u2019s total electricity generation in 2023, according to the study, which is based on the Insitute of Atmospheric Physics dataset.\nWMO will provide full details of key climate change indicators, including greenhouse gases, surface temperatures, ocean heat, sea level rise, glacier retreat and sea ice extent, in its State of the Global Climate 2024 report to be issued in March 2025. This will also give details of high-impact events.\nMr Guterres called on governments to deliver new national climate action plans this year to limit long-term global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C, and support the most vulnerable deal with devastating climate impacts.\nOne or more individual years exceeding 1.5\u00b0C does not mean that we have missed the goal of \u201cholding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change\u201d as stated in the Paris Agreement. This refers to an extended period, typically decades or longer, although the Agreement itself does not provide a specific definition.\nShort-term temperature spikes in long-term warming can be caused by naturally occurring phenomena like El Ni\u00f1o, which persisted from mid-2023 to May 2024.\nAs global warming continues, there is an urgent need for careful tracking, monitoring and communication with regard to where the warming is relative to the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement, to help policymakers in their deliberations.\nAn international team of experts established by WMO has given an initial indication that long-term global warming as assessed in 2024 is currently about 1.3\u00b0C compared to the 1850-1900 baseline.\nWMO uses datasets based on climatological data from observing sites and ships and buoys in global marine networks, developed and maintained by the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (NASA GISS), the United Kingdom\u2019s Met Office Hadley Centre and the University of East Anglia\u2019s Climatic Research Unit (HadCRUT), and the Berkeley Earth group.\nWMO also uses reanalysis datasets from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and its Copernicus Climate Change Service, and the Japan Meteor\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

As global temperatures continue to rise due to climate change, heat wave frequency and severity are expected to continue to increase.5 Areas already impacted by heat islands will likely bear the brunt of these heat waves and their associated harmful health and environmental effects.\nExit EPA\u2019s website\nThese maps represent the number of heat waves per year (frequency) and the number of days between the first and last heat wave of the year (season length) compared with the local temperature threshold for defining a heat wave across 50 U.S. metropolitan areas.6\nWhen people are exposed to extreme heat, they can suffer from potentially deadly illnesses, such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Hot temperatures can also contribute to deaths from heart attacks, strokes, and other forms of cardiovascular disease. Extreme heat events strain high-risk populations disproportionately. 7, 8, 9 Older adults, young children, people of color, individuals with low-income, outdoor workers, and people in poor health are the most vulnerable to these impacts. For example, Figure 2 shows the difference in death rates between some of these population groups.\nUsing 2004\u20132018 data, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded 10,527 heat-related deaths in the United States, an average of 702 per year. These numbers include deaths where heat was reported as the underlying cause or a contributing cause.10 The actual number of heat-related deaths may be much higher because the cause of death may not be reported as \u201cheat-related\u201d on death certificates.8 Heat-related illnesses vary by geography, occurring most frequently in the Southeast and Midwest.9 In the future, continued warming and increases in heat-related deaths are projected to outweigh reductions in cold-related deaths in most U.S. regions.11\nTo learn more about the health impacts of heat exposure, visit these resources:\nThis graph presents summer (May\u2013September) death rates from 1999 to 2018 for three population groups in the United States. The blue line shows rates for the entire population, the green line shows rates for non-Hispanic Black people, and the pink line shows rates for people aged 65 and older.8\nEfforts to reduce heat islands can help mitigate climate change. In addition to lowering urban temperatures, heat island reduction strategies lessen electricity demand for air conditioning and thereby reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with electricity generation that contribute to climate change. Simultaneously, these measures can help communities become more resilient to climate change impacts. For example:\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Over the past century, rainstorms across the US have increased in frequency and severity. Some of the greatest changes in heavy rains have been focused over the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions, where the amount of rainfall occurring in the top 1% of daily events has increased by 55%. The upper Midwest has also emerged as another hotbed of rainfall extremes and flash flooding.\nAs Kenneth Kunkel noted in a Nature News Feature by Alexandra Witze, \u201cIt\u2019s just basic physics\u201d. The amount of water the atmosphere can hold (and eventually release) increases by 7% for every one degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) increase in air temperature. Given that the world has on average already warmed by about 1.2 degrees Celsius, it\u2019s not surprising that we\u2019ve seen extreme rainfall events unfold with greater regularity across the US. Indeed, climate scientists have foreseen these increases in heavy rainfalls as the hydrologic cycle has intensified. In the last decade alone, roughly one out of every four rainfall extremes has had a clear connection to climate change.\nGraph by Dr. Anthony Buda\nIn line with recent summers, the summer of 2022 has already seen its fair share of extreme rains. For instance, during an eight-day period in late July and early August, three separate extreme rainfall events hit portions of Kentucky, Missouri, and Illinois in rapid succession. Roughly a week later, extreme rains near Charleston, West Virginia resulted in extensive flash flooding of streams and rivers. And most recently, extreme rains swamped portions of the Dallas metro area, which was previously suffering from severe drought.\nRecent research now suggests that extreme rainfall events will continue to increase in frequency and intensity across the nation, including in the Northeast. Large thunderstorm complexes, which are predicted to become more frequent and intense with climate change, are likely to play a key role in producing excessive amounts of rainfall. These storm complexes will certainly increase the risk of flash flooding, especially in urban areas. Low-lying regions with poor drainage will also be susceptible to enhanced runoff from these sorts of intense storms.\nPreparing for a future with more extreme rainfall is an urgent task. Here in the Northeast, increasing our resilience to rainfall extremes will require cooperation between scientists, engineers, and planners to update rainfall statistics and modernize urban infrastructure. Such preparation is also needed to maintain the integrity of our agricultural and forested landscapes. By taking these advance measures, we won\u2019t be caught off guard the next time it rains. Because in a warmer world, \u201cWhen It Rains, It Pours\u201d.\nWhile warmer temperatures often promote growth, most crops in the Northeast are already being grown close to their optimum temperature. The region, however, is\u2026\nDoes field crop irrigation make sense as a farm strategy given the number of wet summers in the Northeast?\nWhen rainfall occurs shortly after nutrient application, nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus can be quickly transferred to runoff waters.

The meaning of the 1.5-C climate threshold\n\nGoogle Search Snippet:\nThe 1.5\u00b0C climate threshold, shorthand for global average surface warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures.\n\nFull Page Content:\nThis website is an ARCHIVED version of NOAA Climate.gov as of June 25, 2025. Content is not being updated or maintained, and some links may no longer work.\nNumbers and the meanings we attach to them can be weird. A number can mean a lot or very little depending on how it is being used, and who is using it. To a Taylor Swift fan, 13 is a lucky number. To many in Western cultures, it is a day of bad luck when falling on a Friday. To others, 13 is just the number that comes after 12. When it comes to climate science and policy, one of our \u201c13s\u201d is the 1.5\u00b0C climate threshold, shorthand for global average surface warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures. That\u2019s the level of warming that the countries who signed the Paris Agreement have agreed to try to stay below. But what does pre-industrial mean? How do we know when we\u2019ve passed 1.5\u00b0C? And what happens if we do?\nThe Industrial Revolution transformed the textile industry in England. This engraving by Edward Goodall (1795-1870), originally titled \"Manchester, from Kersal Moor,\" after a painting of W. Wylde, shows numerous industrial chimneys in the town of Manchester, England, which earned the nickname \"Cottonopolis,\" following its transformation. Image in the public domain, from Wikimedia.\nWhen you read or hear climate numbers, they are often being compared to average. The September 2023 NOAA global surface temperatures, for instance, were 1.44 degrees Celsius above average. That average represents a defined period of time. In this case, September was 1.44\u00b0C warmer than the average September of the twentieth century.\nFor the 1.5\u00b0C climate threshold, the \u201caverage\u201d time range is defined as the \u201cpre-industrial period\u201d, or the period of time before the increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases due to human-emissions began to significantly influence global temperatures. Sounds a bit vague, right? What years make up this \u201cpre-industrial period?\u201d It depends.\nMost history books define the dates of the Industrial Revolution as between the mid-1700s and mid-1800s, but scientific definitions of pre-industrial typically cover some range of decades between 1850 and 1900. Why? Because that\u2019s the earliest time period with widespread, consistent surface temperature records. Different research groups use different parts of the broader time range. For NOAA data, we currently define pre-industrial as 1850-1900. (Footnote 1)\nWhile there can be differences in what counts as \u201cpre-industrial\u201d, it's important to remember that industrial versus pre-industrial is really about the human signature on our climate and how scientists can distinguish that from natural variability going back thousands of years. (Footnote 2)\nHow far the global temperature is above average depends on how you define average. For NOAA's global temperature dataset, \"pre-industrial\" is defined as the period from 1850-1900. For routine monthly reports, NOAA compares monthly temperatures to the 20th-century average. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from NCEI.\nAdding to the nuance, global surface temperature itself can potentially refer to different temperature variables measured in different ways. On land, thermometer-measured temperature variables can include readings at both at the literal ground surface and at two meters above. Over water, ships and buoys can measure the surface ocean temperature directly as well as the air temperature two meters above the water. From high above, satellites don\u2019t directly measure temperatures, but scientists derive land surface and atmospheric temperatures based on the amount of thermal and microwave energy satellites receive.\nSuffice to say, there are a lot of ways of measuring temperatures. And THEN there are different ways of combining those observations into a global dataset. (Despite these differences, all major temperature records show a similar long-term warming trend.) When NOAA releases the latest monthly climate statistics, it uses the NOAA Global Surface Temperature (NOAAGlobalTemp) dataset which blends in-ocean sea surface temperatures and 2-meter air temperatures.\nSo, when you come across stories about the 1.5\u00b0C threshold\u2014especially if you think you\u2019re seeing contradictory stories about whether we have or haven\u2019t reached 1.5\u00b0C\u2014 you should ask yourself three questions. 1) What is the dataset? 2) What is the \u201cpre-industrial\u201d time period? 3) What kind of temperature is being used? Those are the details you need to be able to put that story into context and compare it to other sources of information.\nLet\u2019s go back in time before large international climate conferences like COP28 existed. In the 1970s and 1980s, as climate science was evolving and our understanding of the impacts that human activities were having on greenhouse gas emissions, scientists were using different temperature thresholds to understand the potential impacts of these emissions (Nordhaus 1975). These thresholds usually ranged from 1-2\u00b0C.\nAs the international community has come together to address climate change, it became important to have an agreed upon temperature target as a catalyst for climate action When the first international climate treaty was negotiated in 1992, Parties agreed to stabilize \u201cgreenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.\u201d In 2010, the Cancun Agreement further recognized the need \u201cto hold the increase in global average temperature below 2\u00b0C above preindustrial levels\u201d.\nHowever, research continued to show that for some countries and vulnerable ecosystems, the risk of grave damage rapidly increases at less than 2\u00b0C of warming. So in 2015, nearly the entire world (195 nations) came together at the United Nations-held international climate meeting COP21 to sign the Paris Agreement. This landmark treaty explicitly states that the world\u2019s nations pledged to \u201chold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industr\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Human activity is the principal cause.\nEarth's climate has changed throughout history. Just in the last 800,000 years, there have been eight cycles of ice ages and warmer periods, with the end of the last ice age about 11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era \u2014 and of human civilization. Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth\u2019s orbit that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives.\nThe current warming trend is different because it is clearly the result of human activities since the mid-1800s, and is proceeding at a rate not seen over many recent millennia.1 It is undeniable that human activities have produced the atmospheric gases that have trapped more of the Sun\u2019s energy in the Earth system. This extra energy has warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land, and widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred.\nEarth-orbiting satellites and new technologies have helped scientists see the big picture, collecting many different types of information about our planet and its climate all over the world. These data, collected over many years, reveal the signs and patterns of a changing climate.\nScientists demonstrated the heat-trapping nature of carbon dioxide and other gases in the mid-19th century.2 Many of the science instruments NASA uses to study our climate focus on how these gases affect the movement of infrared radiation through the atmosphere. From the measured impacts of increases in these gases, there is no question that increased greenhouse gas levels warm Earth in response.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nIce cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that Earth\u2019s climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly 10 times faster than the average rate of warming after an ice age. Carbon dioxide from human activities is increasing about 250 times faster than it did from natural sources after the last Ice Age.3\nThe planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and other human activities.4 Most of the warming occurred in the past 40 years, with the seven most recent years being the warmest. The years 2016 and 2020 are tied for the warmest year on record.5 Image credit: Ashwin Kumar, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic.\nThe ocean has absorbed much of this increased heat, with the top 100 meters (about 328 feet) of ocean showing warming of 0.67 degrees Fahrenheit (0.33 degrees Celsius) since 1969.6 Earth stores 90% of the extra energy in the ocean. Image credit: Kelsey Roberts/USGS\nThe Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass. Data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment show Greenland lost an average of 279 billion tons of ice per year between 1993 and 2019, while Antarctica lost about 148 billion tons of ice per year.7 Image: The Antarctic Peninsula, Credit: NASA\nGlaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world \u2014 including in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska, and Africa.8 Image: Miles Glacier, Alaska Image credit: NASA\nSatellite observations reveal that the amount of spring snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere has decreased over the past five decades and the snow is melting earlier.9 Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\nGlobal sea level rose about 8 inches (20 centimeters) in the last century.

Warmer temperatures will ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nHeat waves and cold waves\nThis chapter assesses recent trends and likely future changes in climate extremes and climate-driven hazards in Colorado. While it is true that anthropogenic climate change is increasing the overall risk of impacts across the various extreme weather and climate events and natural hazards, both globally and in Colorado, this generalization does not necessarily apply to each type of extreme or hazard. Each type has different climatic drivers, and there may also be non-climatic factors that act to increase (or decrease) their risk and impacts, such as with floods and wildfires.\nIn general, extremes and natural hazards that have strong physical linkages to warming temperatures are the ones most likely to have already increased and to increase further in the future. At the top of this list are heat waves; droughts and wildfires are also worsened in a warmer climate. All three have shown clear recent upward trends in Colorado. Extreme precipitation also has a direct physical linkage with temperature and is expected to become more frequent and severe with warming, yet this has not been clearly seen in our region. Severe thunderstorms and their related hazards - tornadoes, hail, and winds \u2014 have more complex linkages with warming. Due to observational challenges, it is difficult to assess recent trends and future projections for thunderstorm hazards.\nIn the sections below, for each type of climate extreme or hazard, we describe its drivers, examine recent variability and trends to the extent that observed datasets can support that assessment, highlight recent high-impact events, and then summarize the likelihood of future changes and the evidence for that assessment. This chapter emphasizes the observed and potential future changes of these extremes and hazards, with limited references to the impacts from these events. The update to the Colorado Vulnerability Study will provide greater detail on Colorado\u2019s vulnerabilities, documented impacts, and risk of future impacts to these types of events.\nAs the climate warms, periods of extreme heat are expected to become more frequent, while periods of extreme cold become less frequent (USGCRP 2017). Two different approaches can be employed to investigate changes in temperature extremes. One is to consider the exceedance of absolute temperature thresholds (e.g., exceeding 95\u00b0F or dropping below 0\u00b0F). The advantage of this method is that these thresholds are familiar to people, and they generally correspond to some kind of impact (e.g., heat stress to humans and animals increases at higher temperatures). The disadvantage is that, in a state as diverse as Colorado, some areas surpass these thresholds many times per year, whereas other areas may never experience those temperatures. Another method is to consider temperatures that are rare for that location (e.g., a temperature that occurs on average only once per year, or that exceeds a percentile, etc.). Furthermore, when considering heat waves and cold waves, many different definitions have been proposed in the literature (e.g., Perkins and Alexander 2013). Regardless of the specific methods used, available data show that heat waves are generally becoming more frequent, and cold waves less frequent, in Colorado. However, the details of the results vary, as shown below.\nComparing the most recent two decades (2001-2020) to the 1971-2000 period shows that in eastern Colorado and the valleys in western Colorado, the number of hot days (95\u00b0F or higher) has increased. Some areas experienced over 10 more hot days per year during the period from 2001-2020 than during the period from 1971-2000 (Fig. 4.1a). Other thresholds such as 90\u00b0F show similar spatial patterns; although many areas in Colorado, especially at high elevations, rarely or never reach 90\u00b0F.\nVery cold nights are becoming less frequent across Colorado but generally at a slower pace than hot days are increasing. Fig. 4.1b shows that the San Luis Valley has experienced the greatest reduction in sub-zero temperatures, by a few days per year. Most other parts of the state have relatively small reductions of 1-2 nights per year, whereas a few pockets in Gunnison, Fremont, and Rio Blanco Counties have seen small increases in the frequency of sub-zero temperatures. In some areas of southeastern Colorado, temperatures below zero are very rare.\nCalculations at individual stations (not shown) are generally consistent with the findings from the gridded dataset used in Fig. 4.1. However, this gridded dataset only has daily data available back to 1951, and long-term stations in southeastern Colorado show that the dust bowl era in the 1930s had more frequent occurrence of extreme heat than even the first two decades of the 2000s. Nonetheless, recent trends in this part of the state are toward more frequent hot days.\nFigure 4.1\nDifferences in the number of days per year with (a) daily maximum temperature \u2265 95\u00b0F, and (b) daily minimum temperature \u2264 0\u00b0F, comparing the period 2001-2020 to 1971-2000.\nDownload Figure\nIn contrast to the absolute temperature thresholds presented above, heat waves and cold waves are generally defined relative to the historical temperature ranges for an area. Some studies consider heat/cold waves as consecutive days exceeding a threshold (Perkins and Alexander 2013; Keellings and Moradkhani 2020; Domeisen et al. 2023), whereas others consider the average temperature over a period of days (Peterson et al. 2013). Here, we will use a definition for heat and cold waves that is similar to Peterson et al. (2013). Specifically, a heat wave or cold wave is defined using a 4-day averaged daily mean temperature (daily mean is the average of the high and low for the day). The 4-day average temperature that was exceeded on average once per year during 1971-2000 was defined as a heat or cold wave (in other words, the average hottest or coldest 4-day period per year during 1971-2000). This calculation is done for each alternate c\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

That\u2019s why you can blow your hair dry even after a steamy shower. It\u2019s also what dumps rain in the tropics and sucks water from desert soils.\nA new study, published in Nature, shows that the atmosphere\u2019s growing thirst for water is making droughts more severe, even in places where rainfall has stayed the same. The paper details how this \u201cthirst\u201d has made droughts 40% more severe across the globe over the course of the past 40 years.\n\u201cDrought is based on the difference between water supply (from precipitation) and atmospheric water demand. Including the latter reveals substantial increases in drought as the atmosphere warms,\u201d said co-author Chris Funk, director of the Climate Hazards Center at UC Santa Barbara.\nDroughts are usually blamed on a dearth of rain. But scientists have discovered another factor at work: warming air is increasing the atmosphere\u2019s evaporative demand. Atmospheric evaporative demand (AED) acts like a sponge, soaking up moisture faster than it can be replaced. This can pull more water out of soils, rivers and plants.\nIt\u2019s not clear whether a warmer atmosphere will make droughts more or less intense, frequent and widespread. \u201cAs the atmosphere warms, air at a constant relative humidity will hold more water vapor, so rainfall may increase,\u201d Funk explained. \u201cBut at the same time, atmospheric evaporative demand is also expected to increase. So which is increasing more quickly?\u201d\nFunk joined an international team of scientists to examine the role AED is playing in exacerbating droughts around the world.\nScientists knew AED was important, but few studies had carefully measured its global impact using real-world observations, making it harder to predict and prepare for droughts. This new study used a set of high-resolution data covering more than a century, and applied advanced methods to track how AED has increased and how much worse it has made droughts.\n\u201cWe face a big challenge,\u201d explained lead author Solomon Gebrechorkos, a hydro-climatologist at University of Oxford. \u201cThere\u2019s no direct way to measure how \u2018thirsty\u2019 the atmosphere is over time. So, we used high-resolution climate data, identified through a comprehensive global evaluation, and applied the most advanced models for atmospheric evaporative demand \u2014 models that account for multiple climate variables, not just temperature.\u201d\nThe team compared water supply, based on precipitation, and atmospheric evaporative demand using multiple world-class datasets. They then looked at changes in the standardized data, evaluating these changes over time. \u201cThis allowed us to compare wet and dry regions using a common framework,\u201d Funk explained. The authors then identified statistically significant increases in drought.\nThey found that AED has increased faster than precipitation rates, suggesting an alarming tendency towards drier conditions. \u201cI find these results very concerning, but perhaps not terribly surprising,\u201d Funk said. \u201cMost of us are familiar with how air temperatures are increasing rapidly, but most people may not realize the connections between this warming and the desiccating influence of the atmosphere.\u201d In warm areas, raising the temperature by just a couple degrees can dramatically increase the atmosphere's ability to draw moisture from crops, rangelands and forests, he added.\nThis study reinforces past work showing that droughts will become more intense in a warming world. This has implications for global food and water security, which may in turn amplify political instability and conflict. Easier to see are more direct links between increased AED and wildfire. A thirsty atmosphere desiccates plants, which contributes to larger wildfires.\nLooking into the future, this study underscores the importance of early warning systems, drought risk management and effective anticipatory actions. Predicting droughts, and increased atmospheric demand, can trigger effective interventions. For example, farmers might use micro-irrigation or water-retentive soil treatments to offset increased AED. \u201cTo counter increasing drought trends, we need to anticipate and manage the extreme events that lead to concerning increases in drought risk,\u201d Funk said.\nResearchers are also interested in uncovering how evaporation and atmospheric demand interact with water supplies, not just rainfall patterns. Scientists will need to study how farmers, cities and ecosystems can adapt to a world where the atmosphere constantly demands more moisture.\nSlushy hailstones of ammonia and water were part of a bizarre theory to explain the planet's poorly mixed atmosphere.

The coalition is growing. But commitments must be backed by bold, credible actions. By every country in the world. Starting now. Net Zero #ItsPossible. Starting now! Starting now! Starting now!\nPut simply, net zero means cutting carbon emissions to a small amount of residual emissions that can be absorbed and durably stored by nature and other carbon dioxide removal measures, leaving zero in the atmosphere.\nThe science shows clearly that in order to avert the worst impacts of climate change and preserve a livable planet, global temperature increase needs to be limited to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. Currently, the Earth is already about 1.2\u00b0C warmer than it was in the late 1800s, and emissions continue to rise. To keep global warming to no more than 1.5\u00b0C \u2013 as called for in the Paris Agreement \u2013 emissions need to be reduced by 45% by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050.\nTransitioning to a net-zero world is one of the greatest challenges humankind has faced. It calls for nothing less than a complete transformation of how we produce, consume, and move about. The energy sector is the source of around three-quarters of greenhouse gas emissions today and holds the key to averting the worst effects of climate change. Replacing polluting coal, gas and oil-fired power with energy from renewable sources, such as wind or solar, would dramatically reduce carbon emissions.\nYes, a growing coalition of countries, cities, businesses and other institutions are pledging to get to net-zero emissions. As of June 2024, 107 countries, responsible for approximately 82 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, had adopted net-zero pledges either in law, in a policy document such as an national climate action plan or a long-term strategy, or in an announcement by a high-level government official. More than 9,000 companies, over 1000 cities, more than 1000 educational institutions, and over 600 financial institutions have joined the Race to Zero, pledging to take rigorous, immediate action to halve global emissions by 2030.\nThe growth in net-zero pledges has been accompanied by a proliferation of criteria with varying levels of robustness. To develop stronger and clearer standards for net-zero emissions pledges by non-State entities such as businesses, investors, cities and regions, and speed up their implementation, UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres in March 2022 established a High-Level Expert Group on the Net-Zero Emissions Commitments of Non-State Entities. The Expert Group presented its recommendations at COP27 on 8 November 2022.\nNo, commitments made by governments to date fall far short of what is required. Current national climate plans \u2013 for 195 Parties to the Paris Agreement taken together \u2013 would decrease global greenhouse gas emissions by about 12 per cent by 2035, compared to 2019 levels. To keep global warming to no more than 1.5\u00b0C \u2013 as called for in the Paris Agreement \u2013 emissions need to be reduced by 55 per cent by 2035 and reach net zero by 2050. Getting to net zero requires all governments \u2013 first and foremost the biggest emitters \u2013 to significantly strengthen their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and take bold, immediate steps towards reducing emissions now.\nThe six largest emitters in terms of total greenhouse gas emissions are China, the United States of America, India, the European Union, the Russian Federation and Indonesia.\nThe G20 group of the world\u2019s largest 20 economies accounted for about 77 per cent of global GHG emissions in 2024.\nEmissions per person in the United States of America, the Russian Federation, China and the European Union are above the world average of 6.4 tons of CO2-equivalent. In Indonesia and India, per capita emissions remain significantly below the world average.\nSource: UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2025\nGovernments have the biggest responsibility in the transition to net-zero emissions by mid-century. But businesses, investors, cities, states and regions also needs to live up to their net-zero promises.

As ocean temperatures rise ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nThere is unequivocal evidence that Earth is warming at an unprecedented rate. Human activity is the principal cause.\nEarth's climate has changed throughout history. Just in the last 800,000 years, there have been eight cycles of ice ages and warmer periods, with the end of the last ice age about 11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era \u2014 and of human civilization. Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth\u2019s orbit that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives.\nThe current warming trend is different because it is clearly the result of human activities since the mid-1800s, and is proceeding at a rate not seen over many recent millennia.1 It is undeniable that human activities have produced the atmospheric gases that have trapped more of the Sun\u2019s energy in the Earth system. This extra energy has warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land, and widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred.\nEarth-orbiting satellites and new technologies have helped scientists see the big picture, collecting many different types of information about our planet and its climate all over the world. These data, collected over many years, reveal the signs and patterns of a changing climate.\nScientists demonstrated the heat-trapping nature of carbon dioxide and other gases in the mid-19th century.2 Many of the science instruments NASA uses to study our climate focus on how these gases affect the movement of infrared radiation through the atmosphere. From the measured impacts of increases in these gases, there is no question that increased greenhouse gas levels warm Earth in response.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nIce cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that Earth\u2019s climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly 10 times faster than the average rate of warming after an ice age. Carbon dioxide from human activities is increasing about 250 times faster than it did from natural sources after the last Ice Age.3\nThe planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and other human activities.4 Most of the warming occurred in the past 40 years, with the seven most recent years being the warmest. The years 2016 and 2020 are tied for the warmest year on record.5 Image credit: Ashwin Kumar, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic.\nThe ocean has absorbed much of this increased heat, with the top 100 meters (about 328 feet) of ocean showing warming of 0.67 degrees Fahrenheit (0.33 degrees Celsius) since 1969.6 Earth stores 90% of the extra energy in the ocean.

Chris studies climate and climate change while also developing improved data sets and monitoring/prediction systems.\nRead more\nHot air holds more moisture. That\u2019s why you can blow your hair dry even after a steamy shower. It\u2019s also what dumps rain in the tropics and sucks water from desert soils.\nA new study, published in Nature, shows that the atmosphere\u2019s growing thirst for water is making droughts more severe, even in places where rainfall has stayed the same. The paper details how this \u201cthirst\u201d has made droughts 40% more severe across the globe over the course of the past 40 years.\n\u201cDrought is based on the difference between water supply (from precipitation) and atmospheric water demand. Including the latter reveals substantial increases in drought as the atmosphere warms,\u201d said co-author Chris Funk, director of the Climate Hazards Center at UC Santa Barbara.\nDroughts are usually blamed on a dearth of rain. But scientists have discovered another factor at work: warming air is increasing the atmosphere\u2019s evaporative demand. Atmospheric evaporative demand (AED) acts like a sponge, soaking up moisture faster than it can be replaced. This can pull more water out of soils, rivers and plants.\nIt\u2019s not clear whether a warmer atmosphere will make droughts more or less intense, frequent and widespread. \u201cAs the atmosphere warms, air at a constant relative humidity will hold more water vapor, so rainfall may increase,\u201d Funk explained. \u201cBut at the same time, atmospheric evaporative demand is also expected to increase. So which is increasing more quickly?\u201d\nFunk joined an international team of scientists to examine the role AED is playing in exacerbating droughts around the world.\nScientists knew AED was important, but few studies had carefully measured its global impact using real-world observations, making it harder to predict and prepare for droughts. This new study used a set of high-resolution data covering more than a century, and applied advanced methods to track how AED has increased and how much worse it has made droughts.\n\u201cWe face a big challenge,\u201d explained lead author Solomon Gebrechorkos, a hydro-climatologist at University of Oxford. \u201cThere\u2019s no direct way to measure how \u2018thirsty\u2019 the atmosphere is over time. So, we used high-resolution climate data, identified through a comprehensive global evaluation, and applied the most advanced models for atmospheric evaporative demand \u2014 models that account for multiple climate variables, not just temperature.\u201d\nThe team compared water supply, based on precipitation, and atmospheric evaporative demand using multiple world-class datasets. They then looked at changes in the standardized data, evaluating these changes over time. \u201cThis allowed us to compare wet and dry regions using a common framework,\u201d Funk explained. The authors then identified statistically significant increases in drought.\nThey found that AED has increased faster than precipitation rates, suggesting an alarming tendency towards drier conditions. \u201cI find these results very concerning, but perhaps not terribly surprising,\u201d Funk said. \u201cMost of us are familiar with how air temperatures are increasing rapidly, but most people may not realize the connections between this warming and the desiccating influence of the atmosphere.\u201d In warm areas, raising the temperature by just a couple degrees can dramatically increase the atmosphere's ability to draw moisture from crops, rangelands and forests, he added.\nThis study reinforces past work showing that droughts will become more intense in a warming world. This has implications for global food and water security, which may in turn amplify political instability and conflict. Easier to see are more direct links between increased AED and wildfire. A thirsty atmosphere desiccates plants, which contributes to larger wildfires.\nLooking into the future, this study underscores the importance of early warning systems, drought risk management and effective anticipatory actions. Predicting droughts, and increased atmospheric demand, can trigger effective interventions. For example, farmers might use micro-irrigation or water-retentive soil treatments to offset increased AED. \u201cTo counter increasing drought trends, we need to anticipate and manage the extreme events that lead to concerning increases in drought risk,\u201d Funk said.\nResearchers are also interested in uncovering how evaporation and atmospheric demand interact with water supplies, not just rainfall patterns. Scientists will need to study how farmers, cities and ecosystems can adapt to a world where the atmosphere constantly demands more moisture.\nSlushy hailstones of ammonia and water were part of a bizarre theory to explain the planet's poorly mixed atmosphere. These mushballs seem to be real, say UC Berkeley scientists.\nClimate change and habitat loss haunt the newly named trapdoor spider.\nThe University of California opened its doors in 1869 with just 10 faculty members and 40 students. Today, the UC system has more than 295,000 students and 265,000 faculty and staff, with 2.0 million alumni living and working around the world.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Over the past century, rainstorms across the US have increased in frequency and severity. Some of the greatest changes in heavy rains have been focused over the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions, where the amount of rainfall occurring in the top 1% of daily events has increased by 55%. The upper Midwest has also emerged as another hotbed of rainfall extremes and flash flooding.\nAs Kenneth Kunkel noted in a Nature News Feature by Alexandra Witze, \u201cIt\u2019s just basic physics\u201d. The amount of water the atmosphere can hold (and eventually release) increases by 7% for every one degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) increase in air temperature. Given that the world has on average already warmed by about 1.2 degrees Celsius, it\u2019s not surprising that we\u2019ve seen extreme rainfall events unfold with greater regularity across the US. Indeed, climate scientists have foreseen these increases in heavy rainfalls as the hydrologic cycle has intensified. In the last decade alone, roughly one out of every four rainfall extremes has had a clear connection to climate change.\nGraph by Dr. Anthony Buda\nIn line with recent summers, the summer of 2022 has already seen its fair share of extreme rains. For instance, during an eight-day period in late July and early August, three separate extreme rainfall events hit portions of Kentucky, Missouri, and Illinois in rapid succession. Roughly a week later, extreme rains near Charleston, West Virginia resulted in extensive flash flooding of streams and rivers. And most recently, extreme rains swamped portions of the Dallas metro area, which was previously suffering from severe drought.\nRecent research now suggests that extreme rainfall events will continue to increase in frequency and intensity across the nation, including in the Northeast. Large thunderstorm complexes, which are predicted to become more frequent and intense with climate change, are likely to play a key role in producing excessive amounts of rainfall. These storm complexes will certainly increase the risk of flash flooding, especially in urban areas. Low-lying regions with poor drainage will also be susceptible to enhanced runoff from these sorts of intense storms.\nPreparing for a future with more extreme rainfall is an urgent task. Here in the Northeast, increasing our resilience to rainfall extremes will require cooperation between scientists, engineers, and planners to update rainfall statistics and modernize urban infrastructure. Such preparation is also needed to maintain the integrity of our agricultural and forested landscapes. By taking these advance measures, we won\u2019t be caught off guard the next time it rains. Because in a warmer world, \u201cWhen It Rains, It Pours\u201d.\nWhile warmer temperatures often promote growth, most crops in the Northeast are already being grown close to their optimum temperature.

Understanding regional heatwave trends has critical implications for the biophysical and human systems they impact. Until now a comprehensive assessment of regional observed changes was hindered by the range of metrics employed, underpinning datasets, and time periods examined. Here, using the Berkeley Earth temperature dataset and key heatwave metrics, we systematically examine regional and global observed heatwave trends. In almost all regions, heatwave frequency demonstrates the most rapid and significant change. A measure of cumulative heat shows significant increases almost everywhere since the 1950s, mainly driven by heatwave days. Trends in heatwave frequency, duration and cumulative heat have accelerated since the 1950s, and due to the high influence of variability we recommend regional trends are assessed over multiple decades. Our results provide comparable regional observed heatwave trends, on spatial and temporal scales necessary for understanding impacts.\nSubject terms: Climate change, Climate-change impacts, Projection and prediction\nHeatwaves are expected to become more frequent and more intense under global warming, but how these trends differ on a regional scale is not well known. Here, the authors provide a comprehensive assessment of regional changes and show that most heat indicaters have increased since the 1950s.\nDefined as prolonged periods of excessive heat1, heatwaves are a specific type of extreme temperature event. There are many adverse impacts of heatwaves, including on human health2, agriculture3,4, workplace productivity5, wildfire frequency and intensity6, and public infrastructure7,8. The inequality of heatwave impacts has been assessed5,9, adversely affecting developing nations due to a lack of adaptive capacity, as well as varying cultural constraints. These impacts will increase under enhanced global warming, where more rapid heatwave trends will likely produce more severe and possibly irreversible impacts in some sectors9\u201312.\nThere are multiple characteristics to heatwaves, including their intensity, frequency, duration, timing and spatial extent. Additionally, there are numerous ways to define each characteristic, a likely consequence of their expansive impacts as well as potential limitations of the datasets from which they are assessed. There is a general consensus that the intensity, frequency and duration of heatwaves have increased in the observational record, both regionally and globally1,13\u201317. However, all relevant studies have employed diverse metrics, analysed a subset of heatwave characteristics over selected regions, and/or used different extreme thresholds over varying time periods. This undermines a comprehensive understanding of how heatwaves have changed at regional and global scales. An all-inclusive and consistent assessment is imperative for establishing confidence in the general consensus suggested by previous disparate studies, as well as being an integral component in accurately assessing the occurrence of and changes in heatwave impacts.\nThis study provides such an assessment. While data availability limits our analysis to begin in 1950, we find that trends in the spatially consistent Berkeley Earth18 observational dataset match well with common regions between the previously used quasi-global HadGHCND19 dataset and Berkeley Earth is thus useful in furthering our understanding of global and regional changes in heatwaves. Heatwave frequency demonstrates the most significant increase across almost all regions, with nowhere experiencing a significant decrease. While average heatwave intensity displays little change, cumulative heatwave intensity increases at a similar rate to heatwave frequency. Moreover, the most intense heatwave seasons as defined by cumulative intensity generally occur post 2000. By assessing regional trends that commence from all years between 1950 and 2000, we find that the increasing trends of historical heatwave frequency, duration and cumulative intensity have accelerated over many regions. However, climate variability can be a large influence on heatwave trends over timescales of multiple decades, even in recent decades, which are more heavily influenced by enhanced anthropogenic climate change.\nA previous attempt to address global observed heatwave changes13 employed the HadGHCND19 dataset and computed trends for 1950\u22122011. Although a plethora of metrics exist, we define heatwaves using a consistent methodological framework1. This is when at least 3 consecutive days are above a percentile-based extreme threshold over a 5-month warm season (see \u201cMethods\u201d). We assess changes in heatwave frequency, duration and intensity, and also trends in seasonal cumulative heat, briefly expressed as the sum of the temperature anomaly relative to the respective heatwave threshold, across all heatwave days within the season (see \u201cMethods\u201d for more detailed explanations of heatwave characteristics). The cumulative heat metric provides additional and relevant information for impacts12 that is presented here at global and regional scales, alongside the more traditional heatwave metrics used in climate-based studies.\nWe primarily focus on the Berkeley Earth observational dataset18 (see \u201cMethods\u201d) and analyse trends both globally and over the Special Report on Extremes (SREX) regions11 (see Supplementary Table 1). To explore the validity of Berkeley Earth in measuring heatwave trends, we compare the two datasets (Fig. 1) for heatwave frequency (Fig. 1a, b), duration (Fig. 1c, d), intensity (Fig. 1e, f) and cumulative heat (Fig. 1g, h; see \u201cMethods\u201d) where trends span 1950\u22122014.

That\u2019s why you can blow your hair dry even after a steamy shower. It\u2019s also what dumps rain in the tropics and sucks water from desert soils.\nA new study, published in Nature, shows that the atmosphere\u2019s growing thirst for water is making droughts more severe, even in places where rainfall has stayed the same. The paper details how this \u201cthirst\u201d has made droughts 40% more severe across the globe over the course of the past 40 years.\n\u201cDrought is based on the difference between water supply (from precipitation) and atmospheric water demand. Including the latter reveals substantial increases in drought as the atmosphere warms,\u201d said co-author Chris Funk, director of the Climate Hazards Center at UC Santa Barbara.\nDroughts are usually blamed on a dearth of rain. But scientists have discovered another factor at work: warming air is increasing the atmosphere\u2019s evaporative demand. Atmospheric evaporative demand (AED) acts like a sponge, soaking up moisture faster than it can be replaced. This can pull more water out of soils, rivers and plants.\nIt\u2019s not clear whether a warmer atmosphere will make droughts more or less intense, frequent and widespread. \u201cAs the atmosphere warms, air at a constant relative humidity will hold more water vapor, so rainfall may increase,\u201d Funk explained. \u201cBut at the same time, atmospheric evaporative demand is also expected to increase. So which is increasing more quickly?\u201d\nFunk joined an international team of scientists to examine the role AED is playing in exacerbating droughts around the world.\nScientists knew AED was important, but few studies had carefully measured its global impact using real-world observations, making it harder to predict and prepare for droughts. This new study used a set of high-resolution data covering more than a century, and applied advanced methods to track how AED has increased and how much worse it has made droughts.\n\u201cWe face a big challenge,\u201d explained lead author Solomon Gebrechorkos, a hydro-climatologist at University of Oxford. \u201cThere\u2019s no direct way to measure how \u2018thirsty\u2019 the atmosphere is over time. So, we used high-resolution climate data, identified through a comprehensive global evaluation, and applied the most advanced models for atmospheric evaporative demand \u2014 models that account for multiple climate variables, not just temperature.\u201d\nThe team compared water supply, based on precipitation, and atmospheric evaporative demand using multiple world-class datasets. They then looked at changes in the standardized data, evaluating these changes over time. \u201cThis allowed us to compare wet and dry regions using a common framework,\u201d Funk explained. The authors then identified statistically significant increases in drought.\nThey found that AED has increased faster than precipitation rates, suggesting an alarming tendency towards drier conditions. \u201cI find these results very concerning, but perhaps not terribly surprising,\u201d Funk said. \u201cMost of us are familiar with how air temperatures are increasing rapidly, but most people may not realize the connections between this warming and the desiccating influence of the atmosphere.\u201d In warm areas, raising the temperature by just a couple degrees can dramatically increase the atmosphere's ability to draw moisture from crops, rangelands and forests, he added.\nThis study reinforces past work showing that droughts will become more intense in a warming world. This has implications for global food and water security, which may in turn amplify political instability and conflict. Easier to see are more direct links between increased AED and wildfire. A thirsty atmosphere desiccates plants, which contributes to larger wildfires.\nLooking into the future, this study underscores the importance of early warning systems, drought risk management and effective anticipatory actions. Predicting droughts, and increased atmospheric demand, can trigger effective interventions. For example, farmers might use micro-irrigation or water-retentive soil treatments to offset increased AED. \u201cTo counter increasing drought trends, we need to anticipate and manage the extreme events that lead to concerning increases in drought risk,\u201d Funk said.\nResearchers are also interested in uncovering how evaporation and atmospheric demand interact with water supplies, not just rainfall patterns. Scientists will need to study how farmers, cities and ecosystems can adapt to a world where the atmosphere constantly demands more moisture.\nSlushy hailstones of ammonia and water were part of a bizarre theory to explain the planet's poorly mixed atmosphere. These mushballs seem to be real, say UC Berkeley scientists.\nClimate change and habitat loss haunt the newly named trapdoor spider.\nThe University of California opened its doors in 1869 with just 10 faculty members and 40 students.

Understanding regional heatwave trends has critical implications for the biophysical and human systems they impact. Until now a comprehensive assessment of regional observed changes was hindered by the range of metrics employed, underpinning datasets, and time periods examined. Here, using the Berkeley Earth temperature dataset and key heatwave metrics, we systematically examine regional and global observed heatwave trends. In almost all regions, heatwave frequency demonstrates the most rapid and significant change. A measure of cumulative heat shows significant increases almost everywhere since the 1950s, mainly driven by heatwave days. Trends in heatwave frequency, duration and cumulative heat have accelerated since the 1950s, and due to the high influence of variability we recommend regional trends are assessed over multiple decades. Our results provide comparable regional observed heatwave trends, on spatial and temporal scales necessary for understanding impacts.\nSubject terms: Climate change, Climate-change impacts, Projection and prediction\nHeatwaves are expected to become more frequent and more intense under global warming, but how these trends differ on a regional scale is not well known. Here, the authors provide a comprehensive assessment of regional changes and show that most heat indicaters have increased since the 1950s.\nDefined as prolonged periods of excessive heat1, heatwaves are a specific type of extreme temperature event. There are many adverse impacts of heatwaves, including on human health2, agriculture3,4, workplace productivity5, wildfire frequency and intensity6, and public infrastructure7,8. The inequality of heatwave impacts has been assessed5,9, adversely affecting developing nations due to a lack of adaptive capacity, as well as varying cultural constraints. These impacts will increase under enhanced global warming, where more rapid heatwave trends will likely produce more severe and possibly irreversible impacts in some sectors9\u201312.\nThere are multiple characteristics to heatwaves, including their intensity, frequency, duration, timing and spatial extent. Additionally, there are numerous ways to define each characteristic, a likely consequence of their expansive impacts as well as potential limitations of the datasets from which they are assessed. There is a general consensus that the intensity, frequency and duration of heatwaves have increased in the observational record, both regionally and globally1,13\u201317. However, all relevant studies have employed diverse metrics, analysed a subset of heatwave characteristics over selected regions, and/or used different extreme thresholds over varying time periods. This undermines a comprehensive understanding of how heatwaves have changed at regional and global scales. An all-inclusive and consistent assessment is imperative for establishing confidence in the general consensus suggested by previous disparate studies, as well as being an integral component in accurately assessing the occurrence of and changes in heatwave impacts.\nThis study provides such an assessment. While data availability limits our analysis to begin in 1950, we find that trends in the spatially consistent Berkeley Earth18 observational dataset match well with common regions between the previously used quasi-global HadGHCND19 dataset and Berkeley Earth is thus useful in furthering our understanding of global and regional changes in heatwaves. Heatwave frequency demonstrates the most significant increase across almost all regions, with nowhere experiencing a significant decrease. While average heatwave intensity displays little change, cumulative heatwave intensity increases at a similar rate to heatwave frequency. Moreover, the most intense heatwave seasons as defined by cumulative intensity generally occur post 2000. By assessing regional trends that commence from all years between 1950 and 2000, we find that the increasing trends of historical heatwave frequency, duration and cumulative intensity have accelerated over many regions. However, climate variability can be a large influence on heatwave trends over timescales of multiple decades, even in recent decades, which are more heavily influenced by enhanced anthropogenic climate change.\nA previous attempt to address global observed heatwave changes13 employed the HadGHCND19 dataset and computed trends for 1950\u22122011. Although a plethora of metrics exist, we define heatwaves using a consistent methodological framework1. This is when at least 3 consecutive days are above a percentile-based extreme threshold over a 5-month warm season (see \u201cMethods\u201d). We assess changes in heatwave frequency, duration and intensity, and also trends in seasonal cumulative heat, briefly expressed as the sum of the temperature anomaly relative to the respective heatwave threshold, across all heatwave days within the season (see \u201cMethods\u201d for more detailed explanations of heatwave characteristics). The cumulative heat metric provides additional and relevant information for impacts12 that is presented here at global and regional scales, alongside the more traditional heatwave metrics used in climate-based studies.\nWe primarily focus on the Berkeley Earth observational dataset18 (see \u201cMethods\u201d) and analyse trends both globally and over the Special Report on Extremes (SREX) regions11 (see Supplementary Table 1). To explore the validity of Berkeley Earth in measuring heatwave trends, we compare the two datasets (Fig. 1) for heatwave frequency (Fig. 1a, b), duration (Fig. 1c, d), intensity (Fig. 1e, f) and cumulative heat (Fig. 1g, h; see \u201cMethods\u201d) where trends span 1950\u22122014. Note that HadGHCND can only produce a quasi-global assessment of heatwave changes, due to large amounts of missing data over Central and South America, the Middle East, In\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Over the past century, rainstorms across the US have increased in frequency and severity. Some of the greatest changes in heavy rains have been focused over the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions, where the amount of rainfall occurring in the top 1% of daily events has increased by 55%. The upper Midwest has also emerged as another hotbed of rainfall extremes and flash flooding.\nAs Kenneth Kunkel noted in a Nature News Feature by Alexandra Witze, \u201cIt\u2019s just basic physics\u201d. The amount of water the atmosphere can hold (and eventually release) increases by 7% for every one degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) increase in air temperature. Given that the world has on average already warmed by about 1.2 degrees Celsius, it\u2019s not surprising that we\u2019ve seen extreme rainfall events unfold with greater regularity across the US. Indeed, climate scientists have foreseen these increases in heavy rainfalls as the hydrologic cycle has intensified. In the last decade alone, roughly one out of every four rainfall extremes has had a clear connection to climate change.\nGraph by Dr. Anthony Buda\nIn line with recent summers, the summer of 2022 has already seen its fair share of extreme rains. For instance, during an eight-day period in late July and early August, three separate extreme rainfall events hit portions of Kentucky, Missouri, and Illinois in rapid succession. Roughly a week later, extreme rains near Charleston, West Virginia resulted in extensive flash flooding of streams and rivers. And most recently, extreme rains swamped portions of the Dallas metro area, which was previously suffering from severe drought.\nRecent research now suggests that extreme rainfall events will continue to increase in frequency and intensity across the nation, including in the Northeast. Large thunderstorm complexes, which are predicted to become more frequent and intense with climate change, are likely to play a key role in producing excessive amounts of rainfall. These storm complexes will certainly increase the risk of flash flooding, especially in urban areas. Low-lying regions with poor drainage will also be susceptible to enhanced runoff from these sorts of intense storms.\nPreparing for a future with more extreme rainfall is an urgent task. Here in the Northeast, increasing our resilience to rainfall extremes will require cooperation between scientists, engineers, and planners to update rainfall statistics and modernize urban infrastructure. Such preparation is also needed to maintain the integrity of our agricultural and forested landscapes. By taking these advance measures, we won\u2019t be caught off guard the next time it rains. Because in a warmer world, \u201cWhen It Rains, It Pours\u201d.\nWhile warmer temperatures often promote growth, most crops in the Northeast are already being grown close to their optimum temperature. The region, however, is\u2026\nDoes field crop irrigation make sense as a farm strategy given the number of wet summers in the Northeast?\nWhen rainfall occurs shortly after nutrient application, nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus can be quickly transferred to runoff waters.

The authors then identified statistically significant increases in drought.\nThey found that AED has increased faster than precipitation rates, suggesting an alarming tendency towards drier conditions. \u201cI find these results very concerning, but perhaps not terribly surprising,\u201d Funk said. \u201cMost of us are familiar with how air temperatures are increasing rapidly, but most people may not realize the connections between this warming and the desiccating influence of the atmosphere.\u201d In warm areas, raising the temperature by just a couple degrees can dramatically increase the atmosphere's ability to draw moisture from crops, rangelands and forests, he added.\nThis study reinforces past work showing that droughts will become more intense in a warming world. This has implications for global food and water security, which may in turn amplify political instability and conflict. Easier to see are more direct links between increased AED and wildfire. A thirsty atmosphere desiccates plants, which contributes to larger wildfires.\nLooking into the future, this study underscores the importance of early warning systems, drought risk management and effective anticipatory actions. Predicting droughts, and increased atmospheric demand, can trigger effective interventions.

Over the past century, rainstorms across the US have increased in frequency and severity. Some of the greatest changes in heavy rains have been focused over the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions, where the amount of rainfall occurring in the top 1% of daily events has increased by 55%. The upper Midwest has also emerged as another hotbed of rainfall extremes and flash flooding.\nAs Kenneth Kunkel noted in a Nature News Feature by Alexandra Witze, \u201cIt\u2019s just basic physics\u201d. The amount of water the atmosphere can hold (and eventually release) increases by 7% for every one degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) increase in air temperature. Given that the world has on average already warmed by about 1.2 degrees Celsius, it\u2019s not surprising that we\u2019ve seen extreme rainfall events unfold with greater regularity across the US. Indeed, climate scientists have foreseen these increases in heavy rainfalls as the hydrologic cycle has intensified. In the last decade alone, roughly one out of every four rainfall extremes has had a clear connection to climate change.\nGraph by Dr. Anthony Buda\nIn line with recent summers, the summer of 2022 has already seen its fair share of extreme rains. For instance, during an eight-day period in late July and early August, three separate extreme rainfall events hit portions of Kentucky, Missouri, and Illinois in rapid succession. Roughly a week later, extreme rains near Charleston, West Virginia resulted in extensive flash flooding of streams and rivers. And most recently, extreme rains swamped portions of the Dallas metro area, which was previously suffering from severe drought.\nRecent research now suggests that extreme rainfall events will continue to increase in frequency and intensity across the nation, including in the Northeast. Large thunderstorm complexes, which are predicted to become more frequent and intense with climate change, are likely to play a key role in producing excessive amounts of rainfall. These storm complexes will certainly increase the risk of flash flooding, especially in urban areas. Low-lying regions with poor drainage will also be susceptible to enhanced runoff from these sorts of intense storms.\nPreparing for a future with more extreme rainfall is an urgent task. Here in the Northeast, increasing our resilience to rainfall extremes will require cooperation between scientists, engineers, and planners to update rainfall statistics and modernize urban infrastructure. Such preparation is also needed to maintain the integrity of our agricultural and forested landscapes. By taking these advance measures, we won\u2019t be caught off guard the next time it rains. Because in a warmer world, \u201cWhen It Rains, It Pours\u201d.\nWhile warmer temperatures often promote growth, most crops in the Northeast are already being grown close to their optimum temperature.

At least one region is expected to be added to the list when the UK's National Drought Group meets on Tuesday.\nMike Kendon, a Met Office climate scientist and lead author of the State of the UK Climate report, said: \"Every year that goes by is another upward step on the warming trajectory our climate is on.\n\"Observations show that our climate in the UK is now notably different to what it was just a few decades ago.\"\nAs an island squeezed between the vast Atlantic Ocean and continental Europe, the UK sits at the intersection of a whole series of major air masses. That's why the country's climate is so changeable and that variability also makes mapping some climate changes more difficult.\nRainfall patterns fluctuate much more than temperature, the Met Office says, but it finds that, as well as warming up, the UK is also getting wetter, with rainfall increasing significantly during the winter. Between October and March, rainfall in 2015-2024 was 16% higher than in 1961\u20131990, it says.\nBehind all these changes is the relentless rise in average temperatures driven by climate change, the Met Office says. Global temperatures have risen by over 1.3C since the industrial revolution as humans continue to release carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere at an unprecedented rate.\nThe Met Office calculates that the UK is warming at a rate of around 0.25C per decade, with the 2015-2024 period 1.24C warmer than the period between 1961-1990.\nAs the UK's national weather service, the Met Office is the custodian of the Central England Temperature record, the longest-running weather record in the world, based on measurements taken using thermometers and other instruments. It spans from 1659 to the present and it shows that recent warming has far exceeded any observed temperatures in over 300 years.\nThe last three years have been in the UK's top five warmest on record, with 2024 the fourth warmest year in records dating back to 1884.\nEven a small shift in temperatures can significantly increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, as the graph below shows.\nLook how, as the distribution of temperatures shifts, those that were previously extreme are brought into the range and new extremes become significantly more likely.\nWe are often talking about how it used to be colder back in the day. Well that is borne out by the Met Office's data. We really are getting increasingly fewer cold days. The Met Office says there were 14 fewer days with air frosts \u2013 when the air temperature falls below zero - in the last decade compared to the period 1931 to 1990.\nAs in recent years, floods and storms caused the worst severe weather damage to the UK last year.\nA series of named storms that pummelled the UK beginning in the autumn of 2023 helped cause widespread flooding in early January. That contributed to the wettest winter half year \u2013 October 2023 to March 2024 - in over 250 years.\nAreas particularly badly hit by flooding included eastern Scotland, Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and the West Midlands, with some places recording three to four times their usual rainfall for September.\nIn early January of 2024 the Royal Shakespeare Company had to cancel performances for two evenings in a row because of flooding in Stratford-upon-Avon. In November a wall collapsed in Tenbury Wells in Worcestershire after water in a local brook rose, flooding the town centre.\nMet Office Chief Scientist Professor Stephen Belcher said the evidence of the impacts climate change is already bringing showed the urgent need for the UK to adapt to cope with future extremes.\n\"The climate is likely to continue to change, and we need to prepare for the impacts this will have on the weather we experience,\" he said.\nFor the first time this report highlights that UK sea level is rising faster than the global average.\nAs sea levels continue to rise around the UK, the risk of flooding is only going to increase further, says Dr Svetlana Jevrejeva from the National Oceanography Centre.\n\"We know from historical events it is only a matter of time until the UK is next in the path of a major storm surge event,\" she said.\nInevitably the UK's changing climate is having an impact on the natural world.\nSpring in 2024 was earlier than the average for 12 of the 13 spring events on record and was the earliest in the series from 1999 for both frogspawn appearing and blackbirds nesting.\nTh\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The coalition is growing. But commitments must be backed by bold, credible actions. By every country in the world. Starting now. Net Zero #ItsPossible. Starting now! Starting now! Starting now!\nPut simply, net zero means cutting carbon emissions to a small amount of residual emissions that can be absorbed and durably stored by nature and other carbon dioxide removal measures, leaving zero in the atmosphere.\nThe science shows clearly that in order to avert the worst impacts of climate change and preserve a livable planet, global temperature increase needs to be limited to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. Currently, the Earth is already about 1.2\u00b0C warmer than it was in the late 1800s, and emissions continue to rise. To keep global warming to no more than 1.5\u00b0C \u2013 as called for in the Paris Agreement \u2013 emissions need to be reduced by 45% by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050.\nTransitioning to a net-zero world is one of the greatest challenges humankind has faced. It calls for nothing less than a complete transformation of how we produce, consume, and move about. The energy sector is the source of around three-quarters of greenhouse gas emissions today and holds the key to averting the worst effects of climate change. Replacing polluting coal, gas and oil-fired power with energy from renewable sources, such as wind or solar, would dramatically reduce carbon emissions.\nYes, a growing coalition of countries, cities, businesses and other institutions are pledging to get to net-zero emissions. As of June 2024, 107 countries, responsible for approximately 82 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, had adopted net-zero pledges either in law, in a policy document such as an national climate action plan or a long-term strategy, or in an announcement by a high-level government official. More than 9,000 companies, over 1000 cities, more than 1000 educational institutions, and over 600 financial institutions have joined the Race to Zero, pledging to take rigorous, immediate action to halve global emissions by 2030.\nThe growth in net-zero pledges has been accompanied by a proliferation of criteria with varying levels of robustness. To develop stronger and clearer standards for net-zero emissions pledges by non-State entities such as businesses, investors, cities and regions, and speed up their implementation, UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres in March 2022 established a High-Level Expert Group on the Net-Zero Emissions Commitments of Non-State Entities. The Expert Group presented its recommendations at COP27 on 8 November 2022.\nNo, commitments made by governments to date fall far short of what is required. Current national climate plans \u2013 for 195 Parties to the Paris Agreement taken together \u2013 would decrease global greenhouse gas emissions by about 12 per cent by 2035, compared to 2019 levels. To keep global warming to no more than 1.5\u00b0C \u2013 as called for in the Paris Agreement \u2013 emissions need to be reduced by 55 per cent by 2035 and reach net zero by 2050. Getting to net zero requires all governments \u2013 first and foremost the biggest emitters \u2013 to significantly strengthen their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and take bold, immediate steps towards reducing emissions now.\nThe six largest emitters in terms of total greenhouse gas emissions are China, the United States of America, India, the European Union, the Russian Federation and Indonesia.\nThe G20 group of the world\u2019s largest 20 economies accounted for about 77 per cent of global GHG emissions in 2024.\nEmissions per person in the United States of America, the Russian Federation, China and the European Union are above the world average of 6.4 tons of CO2-equivalent. In Indonesia and India, per capita emissions remain significantly below the world average.\nSource: UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2025\nGovernments have the biggest responsibility in the transition to net-zero emissions by mid-century. But businesses, investors, cities, states and regions also needs to live up to their net-zero promises.

As a result of this baseline increase in temperature, we are seeing extreme heat events, such as heatwaves and record-breaking high temperatures, become more frequent, long-lasting, and intense.\nWhilst a 1 \u00b0C background temperature increase may not seem significant, the resulting increase in the severity of extreme heat events is already evident in the observed record. This has widespread and significant impacts.\nExtreme heat events do occur within natural climate variation due to changes in global weather patterns. However, the increase in the frequency, duration, and intensity of these events over recent decades is clearly linked to the observed warming of the planet and can be attributed to human activity.\nGlobal circulation patterns, such as the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), are also being affected by the warming climate. These global circulation patterns affect weather patterns, which can lead to extreme heat events developing. We expect that as the planet continues to warm, these extreme heat events will continue to become more severe.\nThe overwhelming evidence that anthropogenic greenhouse gases are contributing to global warming, and the impacts being felt worldwide, led to the 2015 Paris Agreement. Nearly every nation signed this agreement, agreeing to address climate change and aiming to prevent global temperatures exceeding 2 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\nUK Observations\nEach year a report on the UK State of the Climate is published in order to highlight how the UK\u2019s weather and climate have changed compared to historical averages. The reports use scientific observations from the UK land weather station network and the HadUK-Grid dataset.\nThe top 10 warmest years for the UK since 1884 have occurred since 2002. In contrast, none of the coldest years have been recorded in this century.\nUK average temperatures have increased.\nIn early August 2020, at least twenty stations across southern England recorded maximum temperatures reaching 34 \u00b0C or more on six consecutive days. Five \u201ctropical nights\u201d were also recorded, when temperatures did not drop below 20 \u00b0C. The last time a similar event occurred was the summer of 1976, when at least twenty stations recorded 32 \u00b0C or more for six consecutive days.\nSince the start of this century, all but three years have recorded at least one tropical night. In contrast, only half the years between 1961-2000 recorded tropical nights.\nA special report on climate extremes in the UK found that we are experiencing higher maximum temperatures and longer warm spells in recent years. Warm spells have seen their average length more than double \u2013 increasing from 5.3 days in 1961-90 to over 13 days in the decade 2008-2017.\nSouth East England has seen some of the most significant changes, with warm spells increasing from around 6 days in length (during 1961-90) to over 18 days per year on average during 2008-2017.\nUK average maximum temperatures have increased and warm spells are longer.\nAll this evidence points to the UK\u2019s climate warming in recent decades, leading to warmer summers and milder winters on average. However, it is difficult to quantify if the UK is experiencing more heatwaves in recent years due to their sporadic nature.\nUK Projections\nIn the UK, climate predictions suggest that by the end of the 21st century all areas of the UK are projected to be warmer. Hotter and drier summers are likely to become more common. The latest set of UK climate projections (UKCP18) provide the most up-to-date assessment of how the UK climate could change over the 21st century.\nAs global temperatures rise, the number of days the UK observes 25 \u00b0C or more will increase. Data available here.\nUKCP18 showed that a summer as exceptionally warm as 2018 was very unlikely (less than 10% chance) in the recent past (1981-2000), but that warming so far had increased the chance to between 10-20%.\nBy mid-century, summers as warm as 2018 are expected to occur as often as not (about a 50% chance). By the end of the century the chance could increase to over 90% under a high greenhouse gas emission scenario.\nThe 2022 UK summer heatwave, marked a milestone in UK climate history, with 40\u00b0C being recorded for the first time in the UK and new national records set in Wales and Scotland and England.\nA study by the Met Office Hadley Centre suggests the current chance of seeing days reaching 40 \u00b0C or more is extremely low. However, by 2100 under a high emissions scenario the UK could see 40 \u00b0C days every 3-4 years.\nClimate change is increasing the chance of seeing 40 \u00b0C temperatures in the UK.\nGlobal Observations\nEach of the last four decades has been successively warmer than any decade preceding it since 1850. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) states, with high confidence, that global surface temperatures have increased faster since 1970 than any other 50-year period over at least the last 2000 years.\nThe AR6 report states that it is virtually certain (over 99% probability) that the frequency and intensity of hot extremes have increased on a global scale since 1950. It is also virtually certain that there have been increases in intensity and duration of heatwaves.\nUrban heat island effects have enhanced the impact of global warming in cities, particularly night-time extremes. It is extremely likely that human influence is the main contributor to these observed changes.\nOn a regional scale, Europe, North America, Asia and Australasia have very likely (over 90% probability) observed an increase in heat extremes and decrease in cold extremes. Europe, Asia and Australia have al\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

A measure of cumulative heat shows significant increases almost everywhere since the 1950s, mainly driven by heatwave days.

Heatwave frequency demonstrates the most significant increase across almost all regions, with nowhere experiencing a significant decrease. While average heatwave intensity displays little change, cumulative heatwave intensity increases at a similar rate to heatwave frequency. Moreover, the most intense heatwave seasons as defined by cumulative intensity generally occur post 2000. By assessing regional trends that commence from all years between 1950 and 2000, we find that the increasing trends of historical heatwave frequency, duration and cumulative intensity have accelerated over many regions. However, climate variability can be a large influence on heatwave trends over timescales of multiple decades, even in recent decades, which are more heavily influenced by enhanced anthropogenic climate change.\nA previous attempt to address global observed heatwave changes13 employed the HadGHCND19 dataset and computed trends for 1950\u22122011.

This is when at least 3 consecutive days are above a percentile-based extreme threshold over a 5-month warm season (see \u201cMethods\u201d). We assess changes in heatwave frequency, duration and intensity, and also trends in seasonal cumulative heat, briefly expressed as the sum of the temperature anomaly relative to the respective heatwave threshold, across all heatwave days within the season (see \u201cMethods\u201d for more detailed explanations of heatwave characteristics).

Starting now!\nPut simply, net zero means cutting carbon emissions to a small amount of residual emissions that can be absorbed and durably stored by nature and other carbon dioxide removal measures, leaving zero in the atmosphere.\nThe science shows clearly that in order to avert the worst impacts of climate change and preserve a livable planet, global temperature increase needs to be limited to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. Currently, the Earth is already about 1.2\u00b0C warmer than it was in the late 1800s, and emissions continue to rise. To keep global warming to no more than 1.5\u00b0C \u2013 as called for in the Paris Agreement \u2013 emissions need to be reduced by 45% by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050.\nTransitioning to a net-zero world is one of the greatest challenges humankind has faced. It calls for nothing less than a complete transformation of how we produce, consume, and move about. The energy sector is the source of around three-quarters of greenhouse gas emissions today and holds the key to averting the worst effects of climate change. Replacing polluting coal, gas and oil-fired power with energy from renewable sources, such as wind or solar, would dramatically reduce carbon emissions.\nYes, a growing coalition of countries, cities, businesses and other institutions are pledging to get to net-zero emissions. As of June 2024, 107 countries, responsible for approximately 82 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, had adopted net-zero pledges either in law, in a policy document such as an national climate action plan or a long-term strategy, or in an announcement by a high-level government official. More than 9,000 companies, over 1000 cities, more than 1000 educational institutions, and over 600 financial institutions have joined the Race to Zero, pledging to take rigorous, immediate action to halve global emissions by 2030.\nThe growth in net-zero pledges has been accompanied by a proliferation of criteria with varying levels of robustness. To develop stronger and clearer standards for net-zero emissions pledges by non-State entities such as businesses, investors, cities and regions, and speed up their implementation, UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres in March 2022 established a High-Level Expert Group on the Net-Zero Emissions Commitments of Non-State Entities. The Expert Group presented its recommendations at COP27 on 8 November 2022.\nNo, commitments made by governments to date fall far short of what is required. Current national climate plans \u2013 for 195 Parties to the Paris Agreement taken together \u2013 would decrease global greenhouse gas emissions by about 12 per cent by 2035, compared to 2019 levels. To keep global warming to no more than 1.5\u00b0C \u2013 as called for in the Paris Agreement \u2013 emissions need to be reduced by 55 per cent by 2035 and reach net zero by 2050. Getting to net zero requires all governments \u2013 first and foremost the biggest emitters \u2013 to significantly strengthen their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and take bold, immediate steps towards reducing emissions now.\nThe six largest emitters in terms of total greenhouse gas emissions are China, the United States of America, India, the European Union, the Russian Federation and Indonesia.\nThe G20 group of the world\u2019s largest 20 economies accounted for about 77 per cent of global GHG emissions in 2024.\nEmissions per person in the United States of America, the Russian Federation, China and the European Union are above the world average of 6.4 tons of CO2-equivalent. In Indonesia and India, per capita emissions remain significantly below the world average.\nSource: UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2025\nGovernments have the biggest responsibility in the transition to net-zero emissions by mid-century. But businesses, investors, cities, states and regions also needs to live up to their net-zero promises.

Some even criticize map colors to make their point instead of focusing on the actual numbers: so let\u2019s take a look at what the data shows.\nA 2021 study found that from 2000 to 2019, roughly 489,000 heat-related deaths occurred each year[2] \u2013 more than 70,000 of those occurred during the 2003 heatwave in Europe. And the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) explains \u2013 with virtual certainty \u2013 that human-caused climate change is driving the rise in heatwaves[1].\nThis week many are facing harsh conditions as the first heatwave of 2025 just hit the UK. The heatwave in the UK triggered the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) to issue an alert for all of England, warning of significant heat-related health risks from Thursday 19 June 2025 to Monday 23 June. Over this period, widespread temperatures of 32\u00b0C (89.6\u00b0F) are expected, with some areas potentially hitting 34\u00b0C (93.2\u00b0F).\nAfter becoming aware of this, scientists rapidly studied how climate change may have influenced this event. The results of this study were published on 20 June 2025 by World Weather Attribution (WWA) \u2013 a group of scientists who rapidly study how climate change has influenced the intensity and likelihood of extreme weather events when they occur.\nBelow, we will summarize these freshly released findings.\nThis event unfolded rather quickly. At first, a high-pressure system \u2013 which gives clear skies and gentle wind \u2013 brought sunny, mild conditions in the week of 16 June, but temperatures quickly rose as southerly winds drew warm air into the South of England.\nNow, forecasts predict that on Saturday 21 June 2025, temperatures above 32\u00b0C (89.6\u00b0F) will be widespread in England over several days, meeting the UK definition* of a heatwave (Figure 1).\n*Note: the definition of a heatwave can vary according to region based on the normal temperatures experienced there.\nWWA\u2019s early analysis of this event \u2013 which is ongoing as we write this \u2013 found that human-driven climate change makes these high temperatures in June roughly 100 times more likely.\nIn the report, Dr. Ben Clarke, Researcher at the Centre for Environmental Policy Imperial College London, explains:\n\u201cThis heatwave is another reminder that our planet has already heated to a dangerous level. We\u2019re at 1.3\u00b0C today, but heading for around 3\u00b0C this century. With every fraction of a degree of warming, the UK will experience hotter, more dangerous heatwaves. That means more heat deaths, more pressure on the NHS, more transport disruptions, tougher work conditions and poorer air quality.\u201d\nWWA studied the unusually high June temperatures that are underway by analyzing extreme high temperatures occurring in June from past years. WWA pointed out that this was considered a \u2018super rapid analysis\u2019, rather than a full attribution study. A full study would require the event to finish so they could analyze what was observed.\nHowever, WWA has high confidence in the findings given that they align with the results of a full attribution study they did for a similar region in the UK after an extreme heatwave in 2022. That study showed that climate change made the 2022 UK heatwave \u2013 which brought temperatures as high as 40.3\u00b0C (104.5\u00b0F) \u2013 10 times more likely to occur.\nAlthough expected temperatures are lower for the current event, WWA\u2019s rapid analysis shows a similar influence from climate change. Today\u2019s global temperatures are 1.3\u00b0C warmer than pre-industrial temperatures \u2013 the June 2025 WWA analysis found that this warming has made it 100 times more likely for a single June day in southeast England to climb above 32\u00b0C (89.6\u00b0F).\nWWA created a graphic to visualize this (Figure 2), showing that such an occurrence rose from being a 1 in 2,500-year event to a 1 in 25-year event \u2013 a 100x increase in likelihood. WWA explains that this finding shows that the chance of experiencing the most intense heatwaves is rapidly growing.\nIn addition to single-day high temperatures, WWA also analyzed the heatwave itself \u2013 that is, as a collection of days with extreme heat. The WWA visual below (Figure 3) shows how often we should expect southeast England to meet the heatwave threshold which, in this study region of the UK, is defined as having three days above 28\u00b0C (82.4\u00b0F).\nAs shown below, WWA found that global warming has led to a 10x increase in likelihood that southeast England will meet the heatwave threshold in June \u2013 going from a 1 in 50-year event to a 1 in 5-year event. In other words, southeast England has a 20% chance of crossing that heatwave threshold in a given year, compared to only a 2% chance prior to human-driven climate change.\nAs noted earlier, these results agree with a more robust study conducted by WWA on a similar region of the UK. That 2022 study found that the most extreme heat-waves have become 2\u00b0C hotter due to human-driven climate change.\nWhile the WWA rapid analysis results for the ongoing event have been published, scientists will likely offer deeper insights as the event plays out. Keep an eye out for updates from World Weather Attribution on their heat wave analyses page.\nRegions all around the world experience rising temperatures in summer, but it would be foolish to shrug off heatwaves as just being \u2018hot weather\u2019. Heatwaves can be dangerous to our health and disrupt society in numerous ways.\nAs explained by the World Health Organization (WHO), \u201cHeatwaves are among the most dangerous of natural hazards, but rarely receive adequate attention because their death tolls and destruction are not always immediately obvious.\u201d WHO also explains that heatwaves pose challenges for emergency response services, and can put a strain on resources like water\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Data available here.\nUKCP18 showed that a summer as exceptionally warm as 2018 was very unlikely (less than 10% chance) in the recent past (1981-2000), but that warming so far had increased the chance to between 10-20%.\nBy mid-century, summers as warm as 2018 are expected to occur as often as not (about a 50% chance). By the end of the century the chance could increase to over 90% under a high greenhouse gas emission scenario.\nThe 2022 UK summer heatwave, marked a milestone in UK climate history, with 40\u00b0C being recorded for the first time in the UK and new national records set in Wales and Scotland and England.\nA study by the Met Office Hadley Centre suggests the current chance of seeing days reaching 40 \u00b0C or more is extremely low. However, by 2100 under a high emissions scenario the UK could see 40 \u00b0C days every 3-4 years.\nClimate change is increasing the chance of seeing 40 \u00b0C temperatures in the UK.\nGlobal Observations\nEach of the last four decades has been successively warmer than any decade preceding it since 1850. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) states, with high confidence, that global surface temperatures have increased faster since 1970 than any other 50-year period over at least the last 2000 years.\nThe AR6 report states that it is virtually certain (over 99% probability) that the frequency and intensity of hot extremes have increased on a global scale since 1950. It is also virtually certain that there have been increases in intensity and duration of heatwaves.\nUrban heat island effects have enhanced the impact of global warming in cities, particularly night-time extremes.

    "input_prompt": "Claim:\nDroughts are becoming more common and severe in some areas due to climate change.\n\nArticle Title:\nDroughts and Climate Change | U.S. Geological Survey - USGS.gov\n\nGoogle Search Snippet:\nDrought is a serious environmental threat across the United States. Climate change exacerbates droughts by making them more frequent, longer, and more severe.\n\nFull Page Content:\nYale Climate Connections\n[Para leer en espa\u00f1ol, haga clic aqu\u00ed]\nFor tens of millions of Americans, drought has become an ever-present natural disaster.\nThat\u2019s particularly true in the Western United States. Because of the West\u2019s largely semi-arid and desert climates, droughts are natural occurrences across the region. However, regional climate isn\u2019t the only culprit in drought activity. Climate change, namely rising average temperatures driven by human-generated emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases, is contributing to droughts, too.\nGlobal warming increases the risk of drought in several ways.\nFor one, water generally evaporates more quickly at higher temperatures. For that reason, hotter weather can result in drier soils. As high air temperatures sap liquid water from soils and plant leaves, transforming it into atmospheric water vapor via a process called transpiration, ground-level drying will increase in some regions. (Ironically, this additional atmospheric moisture triggers heavier downpours in other regions, which explains why the overall trend in the U.S. has been toward wetter conditions.)\nHigher air temperatures not only encourage drought conditions to build but also intensify them. What might have otherwise been a mild or moderate drought in a cooler world will become, in a warmer world, more severe as a result of increased evaporation.\nWarming also diminishes snowfall, an essential water resource for the estimated 1.9 billion residents of the Northern Hemisphere who depend on snowpacks, or snow reservoirs that store water during the cooler months and release it when it\u2019s needed in the warmer, drier months. Rising temperatures increase the fraction of winter precipitation that falls as rain rather than snow and also shorten the cold season, so there\u2019s less time for snow to even occur. Such was the case in 2015, the fourth-warmest year in the contiguous U.S., when a snow drought reduced the April snowpack in the Sierra Nevada mountain range to a mere 5% of its historical average water content \u2014 its lowest snowpack in 500 years.\nSeasonal melting of snowpacks can be thrown off-kilter, too. As average temperatures warm above freezing earlier in the spring, snowmelt occurs sooner and faster than usual. And rapid melting results in a shorter period during which soils and plants are kept moist.\nAnother way a warmer atmosphere can disrupt precipitation is by shifting storm tracks. Ordinarily, low-pressure systems known as extratropical cyclones form between 30 and 60 degrees latitude north and south of the equator. But as the climate warms globally, storms are shifting toward the poles. This means that weather features such as atmospheric rivers, which supply as much as 50% of annual precipitation to states in the Western U.S., could cease to pass over regions where their moisture is much-needed.\nScientists see a clear correlation between droughts and global warming. But a correlation between two events doesn\u2019t always mean one caused the other. For example, ice cream sales often increase around the time that baseball game attendance rises, but that does not mean that eating ice cream causes people to attend baseball games. Nor does it mean that attending baseball games causes people to eat ice cream.\nIt can be tricky to attribute an increase in droughts to global warming because droughts are variable. In other words, they can occur every year or every few years, last for years or decades, and cause varying levels of dryness. That makes it difficult to distinguish random events from those possibly shaped by human-caused warming. However, the more drought dovetails with trends of increasing temperature, decreasing precipitation, and with computer model projections, the more confident scientists are in pointing to climate change.\nIn a 2020 study in the journal Science, for example, researchers observed how human-caused climate change is contributing to the 21st-century megadrought in the Western U.S. and northern Mexico by evaluating trends in modeled temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation data between 1901 and 2018. According to the study\u2019s findings, human-caused warming accounts for 46% of this drought\u2019s severity.\nWhat about the rest of the world? Scientists have been cautious about linking human activities to global drought patterns, largely because drought hasn\u2019t occurred as uniformly worldwide as it has across individual regions. That said, building evidence supports the climate change-drought connection on a global scale.\nAccording to an August 2021 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, scientists have high confidence that for every half degree Celsius (0.9 degree Fahrenheit) the atmosphere warms, noticeable increases will occur in some regions in the intensity and frequency of droughts that harm agriculture and ecosystems. Similarly, the report notes that extreme agricultural and ecological drought events that used to occur once every 10 years are now 1.7 times more likely than they were from 1850 to 1900, before humans heavily influenced the climate.\nWhile the intricacies of the climate change-drought connection are still being uncovered, scientists tend to agree on one thing: Droughts will likely become more intense into the 2050s and beyond. The likelihood of megadroughts \u2013 droughts lasting 10 years or more \u2013 is also projected to increase from its current 12% to more than 60%, a NASA study warns.\nA conservation mindset is one of the best defenses against drought and its associated risks of wildfire, crop failure, energy crises, and more. Whether you\u2019re preparing for a drought or are already experiencing one, strengthen your resilience by taking these actions:\nAlthough drought is an immense concern now and in the future, taking small actions such as these can have cascading benefits.\nEditor\u2019s note: This story was originally published Aug. 18, 2021 and was updated May 8, 2023.\nRepublish This Story\nRepublish our articles for free, online or in \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Because of the West\u2019s largely semi-arid and desert climates, droughts are natural occurrences across the region. However, regional climate isn\u2019t the only culprit in drought activity. Climate change, namely rising average temperatures driven by human-generated emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases, is contributing to droughts, too.\nGlobal warming increases the risk of drought in several ways.\nFor one, water generally evaporates more quickly at higher temperatures. For that reason, hotter weather can result in drier soils. As high air temperatures sap liquid water from soils and plant leaves, transforming it into atmospheric water vapor via a process called transpiration, ground-level drying will increase in some regions. (Ironically, this additional atmospheric moisture triggers heavier downpours in other regions, which explains why the overall trend in the U.S. has been toward wetter conditions.)\nHigher air temperatures not only encourage drought conditions to build but also intensify them. What might have otherwise been a mild or moderate drought in a cooler world will become, in a warmer world, more severe as a result of increased evaporation.\nWarming also diminishes snowfall, an essential water resource for the estimated 1.9 billion residents of the Northern Hemisphere who depend on snowpacks, or snow reservoirs that store water during the cooler months and release it when it\u2019s needed in the warmer, drier months. Rising temperatures increase the fraction of winter precipitation that falls as rain rather than snow and also shorten the cold season, so there\u2019s less time for snow to even occur. Such was the case in 2015, the fourth-warmest year in the contiguous U.S., when a snow drought reduced the April snowpack in the Sierra Nevada mountain range to a mere 5% of its historical average water content \u2014 its lowest snowpack in 500 years.\nSeasonal melting of snowpacks can be thrown off-kilter, too. As average temperatures warm above freezing earlier in the spring, snowmelt occurs sooner and faster than usual. And rapid melting results in a shorter period during which soils and plants are kept moist.\nAnother way a warmer atmosphere can disrupt precipitation is by shifting storm tracks. Ordinarily, low-pressure systems known as extratropical cyclones form between 30 and 60 degrees latitude north and south of the equator. But as the climate warms globally, storms are shifting toward the poles. This means that weather features such as atmospheric rivers, which supply as much as 50% of annual precipitation to states in the Western U.S., could cease to pass over regions where their moisture is much-needed.\nScientists see a clear correlation between droughts and global warming. But a correlation between two events doesn\u2019t always mean one caused the other. For example, ice cream sales often increase around the time that baseball game attendance rises, but that does not mean that eating ice cream causes people to attend baseball games. Nor does it mean that attending baseball games causes people to eat ice cream.\nIt can be tricky to attribute an increase in droughts to global warming because droughts are variable. In other words, they can occur every year or every few years, last for years or decades, and cause varying levels of dryness. That makes it difficult to distinguish random events from those possibly shaped by human-caused warming. However, the more drought dovetails with trends of increasing temperature, decreasing precipitation, and with computer model projections, the more confident scientists are in pointing to climate change.\nIn a 2020 study in the journal Science, for example, researchers observed how human-caused climate change is contributing to the 21st-century megadrought in the Western U.S. and northern Mexico by evaluating trends in modeled temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation data between 1901 and 2018. According to the study\u2019s findings, human-caused warming accounts for 46% of this drought\u2019s severity.\nWhat about the rest of the world? Scientists have been cautious about linking human activities to global drought patterns, largely because drought hasn\u2019t occurred as uniformly worldwide as it has across individual regions. That said, building evidence supports the climate change-drought connection on a global scale.\nAccording to an August 2021 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, scientists have high confidence that for every half degree Celsius (0.9 degree Fahrenheit) the atmosphere warms, noticeable increases will occur in some regions in the intensity and frequency of droughts that harm agriculture and ecosystems. Similarly, the report notes that extreme agricultural and ecological drought events that used to occur once every 10 years are now 1.7 times more likely than they were from 1850 to 1900, before humans heavily influenced the climate.\nWhile the intricacies of the climate change-drought connection are still being uncovered, scientists tend to agree on one thing: Droughts will likely become more intense into the 2050s and beyond. The likelihood of megadroughts \u2013 droughts lasting 10 years or more \u2013 is also projected to increase from its current 12% to more than 60%, a NASA study warns.\nA conservation mindset is one of the best defenses against drought and its associated risks of wildfire, crop failure, energy crises, and more. Whether you\u2019re preparing for a drought or are already experiencing one, strengthen your resilience by taking these actions:\nAlthough drought is an immense concern now and in the future, taking small actions such as these can have cascading benefits.\nEditor\u2019s note: This story was originally published Aug. 18, 2021 and was updated May 8, 2023.\nRepublish This Story\nRepublish our articles for free, online or in \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",
