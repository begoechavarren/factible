    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nThe week of Valentine's Day 2021, the temperature dropped below zero. Nobody could remember it being this cold for this long. This was Texas, not Siberia. But Texas is the energy state. There was nothing to fear. Just go home, turn on the heat, and hunker down. That's how it should have gone. Instead, over five days, four million Texans lost power during what turned out to be the coldest winter storm in a half a century. Hundreds died, including an 11-year-old boy who froze to death in his sleep. The state's electric grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, ERCOT, later reported the state was just four minutes away from total grid collapse. The media was quick to blame the state government for not being fully prepared and not acting fast enough. This may be true, but ERCOT's mistakes were symptoms, not the cause, of the problem. The real cause is decades of misguided policies that have left the Lone Star state with an unreliable energy infrastructure. It's a cautionary tale that the rest of the country needs to learn from. From 2010 to 2020, the population of Texas increased by 4 million people, and the state's economy grew by 35%. But while all this growth was happening, the state's reliable energy capacity was actually shrinking. Meanwhile, its unreliable energy capacity was surging. In fact, it almost tripled. Let's break this down. Reliable energy is fossil fuels\u2014coal and natural gas\u2014and nuclear. These fuels produce a near-constant flow of electricity. Unreliable, or variable energy, is renewable energy\u2014wind and solar. They're unreliable because they depend on the whims of Mother Nature. In 2020, Texans got 25% of their energy from renewables. During the February storm, however, that fell to 8%, at one point reaching a deadly low of just 1.5%. The reason? Renewable energy only works when the weather cooperates, but it's useless when it doesn't\u2014like when it conjures up a giant snowstorm. Solar panels don't capture sunlight and wind turbines don't spin when covered in snow and ice. Given renewables' unreliability, how is it that Texas, of all places, became so dependent on them? That story begins in 1999, when Texas politicians on the left and the right fell in love with the idea that they could turn the state into a green energy powerhouse. It sounded like a great idea at the time: Instead of passing any new mandates, they would do it by offering massive subsidies, marketed as \"incentives,\" to produce wind and solar power. This ended up working out great for the wind and solar companies, but not so great for reliable energy providers. To illustrate this, imagine that you own a restaurant. One day you learn that your competitor down the street is getting government support. He gets so much help that, instead of charging his customers, he can pay them to eat his food. Not surprisingly, your customers abandon your restaurant for his. Your competitor prospers off the taxpayers' backs while your business withers. Let's apply this analogy to the real world of renewable energy. Wind and solar get so much in subsidies they're guaranteed a profit. And unlike fossil fuel producers, they're not even required to provide reliable power. It's no wonder fossil fuel plants are closing, and nuclear plants are not being built. The wind and solar companies are protected from the laws of supply and demand. They can't lose, and the fossil fuel plants can't compete. That's how out of whack the Texas electricity market has become. Since 2006, the state has subsidized renewable energy to the tune of $19 billion. All of this came right out of Texans' wallets, courtesy of ever-increasing electric bills and rising property taxes. And what does Texas have to show for it? An electric grid that failed when Texans needed it most. Unfortunately, this scenario is playing out across America. Over the past decade, the federal government has spent over $230 billion on energy subsidies, and that doesn't even include subsidies the states give away. It's true that Uncle Sam also grants favors to fossil fuel companies. Renewable energy advocates love to point this out, but here's what they neglect to mention: compared to fossil fuel companies, for every unit of electricity generated, Washington subsidizes wind 17 times and solar 75 times more. Yet, despite all this aid, renewables provide just 4 percent of the country's total energy supply. The verdict is in: renewable energy is expensive and unreliable. And if it can render America's leading power producer powerless, it can do the same to your state. Government meddling got us into this mess. It's time for politicians to step aside and let the free market get us out of it. I'm Jason Isaac from the Texas Public Policy Foundation, for Prager University.",

Understanding the impacts of this catastrophic event on ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nOn February 11-20, 2021, a historical winter event occurred that set many records, including being the first billion-dollar weather disaster of that year. A deep freeze impacted parts of the continental United States (CONUS), remarkably engulfing the entire state of Texas. Every county in the state as far south as the Rio Grande River and northeastern Mexico was placed under a Winter Storm Warning, with many experiencing wind chill values below zero. It was the coldest winter storm for Texas since December 1989.\nA multitude of factors contributed to the brutal and enduring cold that enveloped the entire state of Texas. One notable factor was the strongly negative Arctic Oscillation (AO)(link is external), a back-and-forth shifting of atmospheric pressure between the Arctic and the mid-latitudes of the north Pacific and north Atlantic. The AO influences weather and climate in North America, Europe, and Asia, making the most impact during the winter season. A strongly positive AO can influence the powerful mid-latitude jet stream to move storms northward, reducing cold air blasts in the mid-latitude regions. With a negative AO, a weaker jet can dip further south, enabling outbreaks of Arctic air into the mid-latitude regions.\nAnother element at play in the cold air outbreak was the polar vortex. A polar vortex is an extensive coverage of low pressure and cold air surrounding Earth's poles. When the polar vortex is strong and stable, the polar jet stream shifts northward, causing the cold air to remain in the Arctic. When the vortex weakens or is disrupted, the jet stream often becomes extremely wavy, allowing warm air to flood into the Arctic and polar air to sink down into the mid-latitudes.\nThe first day of the cold air outbreak occurred on February 10, with precipitation beginning on the following day as sleet and freezing rain fell across Texas\u2019s northwestern counties. The first Winter Weather Advisory was issued on Thursday, February 11 in northwest Texas, where isolated freezing rain was occurring. On Saturday, February 13, a Winter Storm Warning went into effect for Houston from that day to the following Tuesday. Throughout central Texas, including Austin and Waco, six to nine consecutive days of freezing temperatures broke records for the longest freezing streak in the state\u2019s recorded history.\nThe Arctic cold front made its way to southeast Texas on February 14. This day was the turning point where the front became a historic winter event. The rest of the state was placed under a Winter Storm Warning, a Wind Chill Warning, and a Hard Freeze Warning. The warnings continued on Monday, February 15. Constant precipitation that day led to the coldest night of the Great Freeze, though the warnings extended for the rest of the week.\nThe Great Freeze lasted 8 days, 23 hours, and 23 minutes, with the last Hard Freeze Warning expiring on Saturday, February 20th at 9 a.m.\nThough power outages occurred throughout the South, they were mostly concentrated in Texas. At the peak of the outage, nearly 10 million people were in the dark, lacking warmth and the ability to cook food. The freeze also caused water pipes to burst and boil water advisories were issued in many counties.\nFreezing precipitation developed throughout the state on February 15, creating thin layers of imperceptible ice on roadways. Cars slid off of freeways and streets resulting in accidents, including a pile-up of over 100 vehicles on I-35 West in Fort Worth, leaving several fatalities in its wake. Due to the impassable roads and state-wide blackout, there were also shortages at grocery stores.\nThe Texas Department of State Health Services(link is external) reported the death toll at over 200 lives.\nAccording to Texas Parks and Wildlife (TPWD)(link is external), this winter blast caused no less than 3.8 million fish to perish along the Texas coast. Post-freeze surveys estimate that over 60 species were impacted, with fish stock requiring years of recovery. Sea turtles were cold stunned from the temperature drop, making them inactive and unable to navigate to warmer waters. Rescue efforts by different agencies were carried out in an attempt to save as many sea turtles as possible.\nTPWD also stated that while much of the wildlife in inland Texas survived the freezing temperatures, the long-term impacts of the freeze on habitats and vegetation raised concerns for the survival of animals and the ecosystem.\nWhile not the most intense freeze in the state\u2019s recorded history, the Great Texas Freeze caused a billion dollars\u2019 worth of damages, state-wide blackouts, hundreds of fatalities, and enacted a massive emotional and financial toll on Texas residents.\nFor more details and graphs on February 2021\u2019s winter events, visit NCEI\u2019s Assessing the U.S. Climate web story and National Climate Monthly Report.

With a negative AO, a weaker jet can dip further south, enabling outbreaks of Arctic air into the mid-latitude regions.\nAnother element at play in the cold air outbreak was the polar vortex. A polar vortex is an extensive coverage of low pressure and cold air surrounding Earth's poles. When the polar vortex is strong and stable, the polar jet stream shifts northward, causing the cold air to remain in the Arctic. When the vortex weakens or is disrupted, the jet stream often becomes extremely wavy, allowing warm air to flood into the Arctic and polar air to sink down into the mid-latitudes.\nThe first day of the cold air outbreak occurred on February 10, with precipitation beginning on the following day as sleet and freezing rain fell across Texas\u2019s northwestern counties. The first Winter Weather Advisory was issued on Thursday, February 11 in northwest Texas, where isolated freezing rain was occurring. On Saturday, February 13, a Winter Storm Warning went into effect for Houston from that day to the following Tuesday. Throughout central Texas, including Austin and Waco, six to nine consecutive days of freezing temperatures broke records for the longest freezing streak in the state\u2019s recorded history.\nThe Arctic cold front made its way to southeast Texas on February 14. This day was the turning point where the front became a historic winter event. The rest of the state was placed under a Winter Storm Warning, a Wind Chill Warning, and a Hard Freeze Warning. The warnings continued on Monday, February 15. Constant precipitation that day led to the coldest night of the Great Freeze, though the warnings extended for the rest of the week.\nThe Great Freeze lasted 8 days, 23 hours, and 23 minutes, with the last Hard Freeze Warning expiring on Saturday, February 20th at 9 a.m.\nThough power outages occurred throughout the South, they were mostly concentrated in Texas. At the peak of the outage, nearly 10 million people were in the dark, lacking warmth and the ability to cook food. The freeze also caused water pipes to burst and boil water advisories were issued in many counties.\nFreezing precipitation developed throughout the state on February 15, creating thin layers of imperceptible ice on roadways. Cars slid off of freeways and streets resulting in accidents, including a pile-up of over 100 vehicles on I-35 West in Fort Worth, leaving several fatalities in its wake. Due to the impassable roads and state-wide blackout, there were also shortages at grocery stores.\nThe Texas Department of State Health Services(link is external) reported the death toll at over 200 lives.\nAccording to Texas Parks and Wildlife (TPWD)(link is external), this winter blast caused no less than 3.8 million fish to perish along the Texas coast. Post-freeze surveys estimate that over 60 species were impacted, with fish stock requiring years of recovery. Sea turtles were cold stunned from the temperature drop, making them inactive and unable to navigate to warmer waters. Rescue efforts by different agencies were carried out in an attempt to save as many sea turtles as possible.\nTPWD also stated that while much of the wildlife in inland Texas survived the freezing temperatures, the long-term impacts of the freeze on habitats and vegetation raised concerns for the survival of animals and the ecosystem.\nWhile not the most intense freeze in the state\u2019s recorded history, the Great Texas Freeze caused a billion dollars\u2019 worth of damages, state-wide blackouts, hundreds of fatalities, and enacted a massive emotional and financial toll on Texas residents.\nFor more details and graphs on February 2021\u2019s winter events, visit NCEI\u2019s Assessing the U.S. Climate web story and National Climate Monthly Report.

In 2021, fluctuations to the polar vortex were responsible for the coldest February since 1989. According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), natural disruptions caused the polar vortex to weaken, wobble, and slip southward off the pole. The extreme weather event brought record-low temperatures to a large portion of central Canada, the United States and even northern Mexico. Temperatures recorded during February fell as much as 25 to 50\u00b0F below average.\nSouthern states in the U.S. were the most affected by the descending Arctic air, particularly in Texas and parts of Oklahoma and Arkansas. Other weather patterns interacted with the cold front to cause an unprecedented band of freezing air to linger over the South for most of early February.\nFurthermore, severe winter storms during February brought heavy snowfall and treacherous icy conditions to large communities such as Houston, which rarely see snow at all. In Texas, the cold front caused further damage by putting significant strain on the municipal power grid and water supply. Millions of Texans lost power during the storm and were unable to heat their homes or prevent their water pipes from bursting. At least 217 people were killed directly or indirectly by the severe cold, and property damages were estimated to be at least $195 billion.\nMaking matters worse, the state\u2019s power plants were not prepared to handle the sustained freezing conditions that are rare in Texas. The power grid failures led to further shortages in basic food supplies and clean drinking water as the winter storm interfered with supply chains and municipal plumbing grids. These shortages also made it harder for hospitals to care for thousands of patients suffering from hypothermia (subnormal body temperature) and other injuries caused by the storm. For those sticking it out at home, Texans were advised to boil their tap water to prevent risk of illness until wastewater treatment facilities could get back online.\nNatural gas was hit the hardest of all the utilities in Texas because both the production and distribution pipelines froze and shut down. The problem only worsened as millions of freezing Texans turned up their heat. The abrupt spike in demand for natural gas for heating purposes led to shortages at power plants using natural gas to produce electricity. Some natural gas providers even took their power plants completely offline to avoid paying the high cost of fuel and to avoid long-term damage to their facilities. With coal, wind, and nuclear power plants also stressed with their own power shortages, the state\u2019s energy grid collapsed in a time of great need.\nWhat is the polar vortex? In recent years, \u201cpolar vortex\u201d has become a commonly used term during winter weather reports throughout North America. While many people would recognize this phrase or use it to describe colder than usual weather, its scientific meaning is complex and the natural phenomenon\u2019s connection to climate change is still largely unknown.\nIn essence, the polar vortex is a band of westerly winds that accumulates between 10 and 30 miles above the North Pole every winter (there is a similar polar vortex at the South Pole but it has less effect on weather in the Northern Hemisphere). Surrounding the vortex at lower altitude in the troposphere \u2013 5 to 9 miles above the surface \u2013 the polar jet stream works to keep this large body of extremely cold air contained in the stratosphere.\nIsolated from warmer latitudes by the polar jet stream below, the air inside the vortex grows progressively colder throughout the winter. During a normal winter when the polar vortex is stable, the polar jet stream is able to shift northward and more firmly contain the vortex of cold air (left diagram). In this scenario, the coldest polar air remains in the Arctic, resulting in milder weather in the mid-latitudes.\nConversely, in years when the polar vortex weakens or shifts, the polar jet stream can become wavier, lose strength, slow down, or sometimes reverse. These disruptions to the polar vortex\u2019s usual position are called sudden stratospheric warmings because they allow warm air from the south to be pulled into the Arctic, which can contribute to glacial melt. When this happens, the displaced polar air is pushed south into the mid-latitudes, which can consequently cause the freezing temperatures and inclement winter weather the polar vortex is known for in America (right diagram). This phenomenon naturally occurs every few years but is hard to predict or prepare for.\nAre severe winter storms caused by the polar vortex linked to climate change? The extreme cold in the Southern Plains during February 2021 also coincided with warmer-than- average temperatures in the Arctic. It follows to wonder if changes in the frequency and severity of polar vortex fluctuation events is caused by or contributing to global warming. Are severe winter weather outbreaks in the mid-latitudes becoming more likely?\nBecause disruptions of the polar vortex occur when the polar jet stream below it is altered, any forces \u2013 including changes to surface and sea temperature that impact the strength or location of the polar jet stream \u2013 can act to initiate a release of cold air from the Arctic. It appears that warming in the Arctic and diminishing sea ice is causing the polar jet stream to meander irregularly in at least two places, which makes it more likely to disrupt the polar vortex. So it is plausible that even though there is an overall warming trend on Earth due to human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, we may see an increase in the severity of winter weather events in the mid-latitude regions of North America and Eurasia due to interactions of the warming with the polar vortex.\nOn the other hand, outbreaks of cold Arctic air ar\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

A deep freeze impacted parts of the continental United States (CONUS), remarkably engulfing the entire state of Texas. Every county in the state as far south as the Rio Grande River and northeastern Mexico was placed under a Winter Storm Warning, with many experiencing wind chill values below zero. It was the coldest winter storm for Texas since December 1989.\nA multitude of factors contributed to the brutal and enduring cold that enveloped the entire state of Texas. One notable factor was the strongly negative Arctic Oscillation (AO)(link is external), a back-and-forth shifting of atmospheric pressure between the Arctic and the mid-latitudes of the north Pacific and north Atlantic. The AO influences weather and climate in North America, Europe, and Asia, making the most impact during the winter season. A strongly positive AO can influence the powerful mid-latitude jet stream to move storms northward, reducing cold air blasts in the mid-latitude regions. With a negative AO, a weaker jet can dip further south, enabling outbreaks of Arctic air into the mid-latitude regions.\nAnother element at play in the cold air outbreak was the polar vortex. A polar vortex is an extensive coverage of low pressure and cold air surrounding Earth's poles. When the polar vortex is strong and stable, the polar jet stream shifts northward, causing the cold air to remain in the Arctic. When the vortex weakens or is disrupted, the jet stream often becomes extremely wavy, allowing warm air to flood into the Arctic and polar air to sink down into the mid-latitudes.\nThe first day of the cold air outbreak occurred on February 10, with precipitation beginning on the following day as sleet and freezing rain fell across Texas\u2019s northwestern counties. The first Winter Weather Advisory was issued on Thursday, February 11 in northwest Texas, where isolated freezing rain was occurring. On Saturday, February 13, a Winter Storm Warning went into effect for Houston from that day to the following Tuesday. Throughout central Texas, including Austin and Waco, six to nine consecutive days of freezing temperatures broke records for the longest freezing streak in the state\u2019s recorded history.\nThe Arctic cold front made its way to southeast Texas on February 14. This day was the turning point where the front became a historic winter event. The rest of the state was placed under a Winter Storm Warning, a Wind Chill Warning, and a Hard Freeze Warning. The warnings continued on Monday, February 15. Constant precipitation that day led to the coldest night of the Great Freeze, though the warnings extended for the rest of the week.\nThe Great Freeze lasted 8 days, 23 hours, and 23 minutes, with the last Hard Freeze Warning expiring on Saturday, February 20th at 9 a.m.\nThough power outages occurred throughout the South, they were mostly concentrated in Texas. At the peak of the outage, nearly 10 million people were in the dark, lacking warmth and the ability to cook food. The freeze also caused water pipes to burst and boil water advisories were issued in many counties.\nFreezing precipitation developed throughout the state on February 15, creating thin layers of imperceptible ice on roadways. Cars slid off of freeways and streets resulting in accidents, including a pile-up of over 100 vehicles on I-35 West in Fort Worth, leaving several fatalities in its wake. Due to the impassable roads and state-wide blackout, there were also shortages at grocery stores.\nThe Texas Department of State Health Services(link is external) reported the death toll at over 200 lives.\nAccording to Texas Parks and Wildlife (TPWD)(link is external), this winter blast caused no less than 3.8 million fish to perish along the Texas coast.

Sea turtles were cold stunned from the temperature drop, making them inactive and unable to navigate to warmer waters. Rescue efforts by different agencies were carried out in an attempt to save as many sea turtles as possible.\nTPWD also stated that while much of the wildlife in inland Texas survived the freezing temperatures, the long-term impacts of the freeze on habitats and vegetation raised concerns for the survival of animals and the ecosystem.\nWhile not the most intense freeze in the state\u2019s recorded history, the Great Texas Freeze caused a billion dollars\u2019 worth of damages, state-wide blackouts, hundreds of fatalities, and enacted a massive emotional and financial toll on Texas residents.\nFor more details and graphs on February 2021\u2019s winter events, visit NCEI\u2019s Assessing the U.S. Climate web story and National Climate Monthly Report.

In 2021, fluctuations to the polar vortex were responsible for the coldest February since 1989. According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), natural disruptions caused the polar vortex to weaken, wobble, and slip southward off the pole. The extreme weather event brought record-low temperatures to a large portion of central Canada, the United States and even northern Mexico. Temperatures recorded during February fell as much as 25 to 50\u00b0F below average.\nSouthern states in the U.S. were the most affected by the descending Arctic air, particularly in Texas and parts of Oklahoma and Arkansas. Other weather patterns interacted with the cold front to cause an unprecedented band of freezing air to linger over the South for most of early February.\nFurthermore, severe winter storms during February brought heavy snowfall and treacherous icy conditions to large communities such as Houston, which rarely see snow at all. In Texas, the cold front caused further damage by putting significant strain on the municipal power grid and water supply. Millions of Texans lost power during the storm and were unable to heat their homes or prevent their water pipes from bursting. At least 217 people were killed directly or indirectly by the severe cold, and property damages were estimated to be at least $195 billion.\nMaking matters worse, the state\u2019s power plants were not prepared to handle the sustained freezing conditions that are rare in Texas. The power grid failures led to further shortages in basic food supplies and clean drinking water as the winter storm interfered with supply chains and municipal plumbing grids. These shortages also made it harder for hospitals to care for thousands of patients suffering from hypothermia (subnormal body temperature) and other injuries caused by the storm. For those sticking it out at home, Texans were advised to boil their tap water to prevent risk of illness until wastewater treatment facilities could get back online.\nNatural gas was hit the hardest of all the utilities in Texas because both the production and distribution pipelines froze and shut down. The problem only worsened as millions of freezing Texans turned up their heat. The abrupt spike in demand for natural gas for heating purposes led to shortages at power plants using natural gas to produce electricity. Some natural gas providers even took their power plants completely offline to avoid paying the high cost of fuel and to avoid long-term damage to their facilities. With coal, wind, and nuclear power plants also stressed with their own power shortages, the state\u2019s energy grid collapsed in a time of great need.\nWhat is the polar vortex? In recent years, \u201cpolar vortex\u201d has become a commonly used term during winter weather reports throughout North America. While many people would recognize this phrase or use it to describe colder than usual weather, its scientific meaning is complex and the natural phenomenon\u2019s connection to climate change is still largely unknown.\nIn essence, the polar vortex is a band of westerly winds that accumulates between 10 and 30 miles above the North Pole every winter (there is a similar polar vortex at the South Pole but it has less effect on weather in the Northern Hemisphere). Surrounding the vortex at lower altitude in the troposphere \u2013 5 to 9 miles above the surface \u2013 the polar jet stream works to keep this large body of extremely cold air contained in the stratosphere.\nIsolated from warmer latitudes by the polar jet stream below, the air inside the vortex grows progressively colder throughout the winter. During a normal winter when the polar vortex is stable, the polar jet stream is able to shift northward and more firmly contain the vortex of cold air (left diagram). In this scenario, the coldest polar air remains in the Arctic, resulting in milder weather in the mid-latitudes.\nConversely, in years when the polar vortex weakens or shifts, the polar jet stream can become wavier, lose strength, slow down, or sometimes reverse. These disruptions to the polar vortex\u2019s usual position are called sudden stratospheric warmings because they allow warm air from the south to be pulled into the Arctic, which can contribute to glacial melt. When this happens, the displaced polar air is pushed south into the mid-latitudes, which can consequently cause the freezing temperatures and inclement winter weather the polar vortex is known for in America (right diagram). This phenomenon naturally occurs every few years but is hard to predict or prepare for.\nAre severe winter storms caused by the polar vortex linked to climate change? The extreme cold in the Southern Plains during February 2021 also coincided with warmer-than- average temperatures in the Arctic. It follows to wonder if changes in the frequency and severity of polar vortex fluctuation events is caused by or contributing to global warming. Are severe winter weather outbreaks in the mid-latitudes becoming more likely?\nBecause disruptions of the polar vortex occur when the polar jet stream below it is altered, any forces \u2013 including changes to surface and sea temperature that impact the strength or location of the polar jet stream \u2013 can act to initiate a release of cold air from the Arctic. It appears that warming in the Arctic and diminishing sea ice is causing the polar jet stream to meander irregularly in at least two places, which makes it more likely to disrupt the polar vortex. So it is plausible that even though there is an overall warming trend on Earth due to human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, we may see an increase in the severity of winter weather events in the mid-latitude regions of North America and Eurasia due to interactions of the warming with the polar vortex.\nOn the other hand, outbreaks of cold Arctic air ar\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Extreme winter weather caused natural gas production freeze-offs and higher electricity and commodity prices, especially in the top energy-consuming state, Texas. The cold snap affected natural gas production and industrial sector consumption the most, which had the largest monthly declines on record, while residential sector consumption reached a record high.\nU.S. natural gas production in February 2021\u2014measured by gross withdrawals\u2014averaged 104.8 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d), an 8.1 Bcf/d (7%) decrease from January, the largest monthly decline on record. Decreased natural gas production in Texas accounted for most of the overall decline. Texas natural gas production fell by a record 4.3 Bcf/d (15%) to 21.5 Bcf/d.\nFrom February 8 to 17, natural gas production in Texas fell by more than 10 Bcf/d. The decline in natural gas production was mostly a result of freeze-offs, when water and other liquids in natural gas wells freeze at the wellhead or in natural gas gathering lines and block the flow. Texas natural gas production infrastructure is more susceptible to the effects of extremely cold weather because it is not winterized to the same extent as natural gas production infrastructure in colder, northern areas of the Lower 48 states.\nIn February, industrial sector natural gas consumption in Texas fell to 4.1 Bcf/d, or 23% lower than year-ago levels, the largest monthly decline on record. This drop relates to both the direct effects of the extreme cold weather, including power outages and equipment failure, and indirect effects, such as supply shortages and extreme prices. Texas is the largest natural gas-consuming state overall because of its large volumes of consumption in its industrial sector.\nIn February, U.S. consumption of natural gas in the residential sector typically decreases compared with January. Instead, Texas experienced a monthly increase in residential sector consumption because of the extreme cold weather when temperatures remained below freezing for several days. Residential sector consumption in Texas during February reached a monthly record high of 1.8 Bcf/d, 53% higher than year-ago levels and 64% higher than the five-year average. Similarly, commercial sector consumption of natural gas in Texas increased in February, reaching 0.92 Bcf/d, the highest level since January 2018.\nIn Texas\u2019s electric power sector, consumption was essentially flat year over year for February at 4.5 Bcf/, an increase of 1% compared with February 2020. More than 60% of homes in Texas use electricity for home heating, meaning that February\u2019s cold snap should have led to a surge in electricity consumption. However, electricity outages across Texas limited consumption.\nOn February 17, the U.S. benchmark Henry Hub natural gas spot price reached $23.86 dollars per million British thermal unit (MMBtu). By contrast, residential and commercial natural gas prices remained fairly flat for the month in most states because of regulatory policies that set price parameters in advance.\nPrincipal contributors: Mike Kopalek, Emily Geary\nTags: production/supply, natural gas, weather, Texas, states\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

A deep freeze impacted parts of the continental United States (CONUS), remarkably engulfing the entire state of Texas. Every county in the state as far south as the Rio Grande River and northeastern Mexico was placed under a Winter Storm Warning, with many experiencing wind chill values below zero. It was the coldest winter storm for Texas since December 1989.\nA multitude of factors contributed to the brutal and enduring cold that enveloped the entire state of Texas. One notable factor was the strongly negative Arctic Oscillation (AO)(link is external), a back-and-forth shifting of atmospheric pressure between the Arctic and the mid-latitudes of the north Pacific and north Atlantic. The AO influences weather and climate in North America, Europe, and Asia, making the most impact during the winter season. A strongly positive AO can influence the powerful mid-latitude jet stream to move storms northward, reducing cold air blasts in the mid-latitude regions. With a negative AO, a weaker jet can dip further south, enabling outbreaks of Arctic air into the mid-latitude regions.\nAnother element at play in the cold air outbreak was the polar vortex. A polar vortex is an extensive coverage of low pressure and cold air surrounding Earth's poles. When the polar vortex is strong and stable, the polar jet stream shifts northward, causing the cold air to remain in the Arctic. When the vortex weakens or is disrupted, the jet stream often becomes extremely wavy, allowing warm air to flood into the Arctic and polar air to sink down into the mid-latitudes.\nThe first day of the cold air outbreak occurred on February 10, with precipitation beginning on the following day as sleet and freezing rain fell across Texas\u2019s northwestern counties. The first Winter Weather Advisory was issued on Thursday, February 11 in northwest Texas, where isolated freezing rain was occurring. On Saturday, February 13, a Winter Storm Warning went into effect for Houston from that day to the following Tuesday. Throughout central Texas, including Austin and Waco, six to nine consecutive days of freezing temperatures broke records for the longest freezing streak in the state\u2019s recorded history.\nThe Arctic cold front made its way to southeast Texas on February 14. This day was the turning point where the front became a historic winter event. The rest of the state was placed under a Winter Storm Warning, a Wind Chill Warning, and a Hard Freeze Warning. The warnings continued on Monday, February 15. Constant precipitation that day led to the coldest night of the Great Freeze, though the warnings extended for the rest of the week.\nThe Great Freeze lasted 8 days, 23 hours, and 23 minutes, with the last Hard Freeze Warning expiring on Saturday, February 20th at 9 a.m.\nThough power outages occurred throughout the South, they were mostly concentrated in Texas. At the peak of the outage, nearly 10 million people were in the dark, lacking warmth and the ability to cook food. The freeze also caused water pipes to burst and boil water advisories were issued in many counties.\nFreezing precipitation developed throughout the state on February 15, creating thin layers of imperceptible ice on roadways. Cars slid off of freeways and streets resulting in accidents, including a pile-up of over 100 vehicles on I-35 West in Fort Worth, leaving several fatalities in its wake. Due to the impassable roads and state-wide blackout, there were also shortages at grocery stores.\nThe Texas Department of State Health Services(link is external) reported the death toll at over 200 lives.\nAccording to Texas Parks and Wildlife (TPWD)(link is external), this winter blast caused no less than 3.8 million fish to perish along the Texas coast. Post-freeze surveys estimate that over 60 species were impacted, with fish stock requiring years of recovery. Sea turtles were cold stunned from the temperature drop, making them inactive and unable to navigate to warmer waters. Rescue efforts by different agencies were carried out in an attempt to save as many sea turtles as possible.\nTPWD also stated that while much of the wildlife in inland Texas survived the freezing temperatures, the long-term impacts of the freeze on habitats and vegetation raised concerns for the survival of animals and the ecosystem.\nWhile not the most intense freeze in the state\u2019s recorded history, the Great Texas Freeze caused a billion dollars\u2019 worth of damages, state-wide blackouts, hundreds of fatalities, and enacted a massive emotional and financial toll on Texas residents.\nFor more details and graphs on February 2021\u2019s winter events, visit NCEI\u2019s Assessing the U.S. Climate web story and National Climate Monthly Report.

Numerous areas in Texas saw temperatures that were 35-40 degrees below ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nOn February 11-20, 2021, a historical winter event occurred that set many records, including being the first billion-dollar weather disaster of that year. A deep freeze impacted parts of the continental United States (CONUS), remarkably engulfing the entire state of Texas. Every county in the state as far south as the Rio Grande River and northeastern Mexico was placed under a Winter Storm Warning, with many experiencing wind chill values below zero. It was the coldest winter storm for Texas since December 1989.\nA multitude of factors contributed to the brutal and enduring cold that enveloped the entire state of Texas. One notable factor was the strongly negative Arctic Oscillation (AO)(link is external), a back-and-forth shifting of atmospheric pressure between the Arctic and the mid-latitudes of the north Pacific and north Atlantic. The AO influences weather and climate in North America, Europe, and Asia, making the most impact during the winter season. A strongly positive AO can influence the powerful mid-latitude jet stream to move storms northward, reducing cold air blasts in the mid-latitude regions. With a negative AO, a weaker jet can dip further south, enabling outbreaks of Arctic air into the mid-latitude regions.\nAnother element at play in the cold air outbreak was the polar vortex. A polar vortex is an extensive coverage of low pressure and cold air surrounding Earth's poles. When the polar vortex is strong and stable, the polar jet stream shifts northward, causing the cold air to remain in the Arctic. When the vortex weakens or is disrupted, the jet stream often becomes extremely wavy, allowing warm air to flood into the Arctic and polar air to sink down into the mid-latitudes.\nThe first day of the cold air outbreak occurred on February 10, with precipitation beginning on the following day as sleet and freezing rain fell across Texas\u2019s northwestern counties. The first Winter Weather Advisory was issued on Thursday, February 11 in northwest Texas, where isolated freezing rain was occurring. On Saturday, February 13, a Winter Storm Warning went into effect for Houston from that day to the following Tuesday. Throughout central Texas, including Austin and Waco, six to nine consecutive days of freezing temperatures broke records for the longest freezing streak in the state\u2019s recorded history.\nThe Arctic cold front made its way to southeast Texas on February 14. This day was the turning point where the front became a historic winter event. The rest of the state was placed under a Winter Storm Warning, a Wind Chill Warning, and a Hard Freeze Warning. The warnings continued on Monday, February 15. Constant precipitation that day led to the coldest night of the Great Freeze, though the warnings extended for the rest of the week.\nThe Great Freeze lasted 8 days, 23 hours, and 23 minutes, with the last Hard Freeze Warning expiring on Saturday, February 20th at 9 a.m.\nThough power outages occurred throughout the South, they were mostly concentrated in Texas. At the peak of the outage, nearly 10 million people were in the dark, lacking warmth and the ability to cook food. The freeze also caused water pipes to burst and boil water advisories were issued in many counties.\nFreezing precipitation developed throughout the state on February 15, creating thin layers of imperceptible ice on roadways. Cars slid off of freeways and streets resulting in accidents, including a pile-up of over 100 vehicles on I-35 West in Fort Worth, leaving several fatalities in its wake. Due to the impassable roads and state-wide blackout, there were also shortages at grocery stores.\nThe Texas Department of State Health Services(link is external) reported the death toll at over 200 lives.\nAccording to Texas Parks and Wildlife (TPWD)(link is external), this winter blast caused no less than 3.8 million fish to perish along the Texas coast. Post-freeze surveys estimate that over 60 species were impacted, with fish stock requiring years of recovery. Sea turtles were cold stunned from the temperature drop, making them inactive and unable to navigate to warmer waters. Rescue efforts by different agencies were carried out in an attempt to save as many sea turtles as possible.\nTPWD also stated that while much of the wildlife in inland Texas survived the freezing temperatures, the long-term impacts of the freeze on habitats and vegetation raised concerns for the survival of animals and the ecosystem.\nWhile not the most intense freeze in the state\u2019s recorded history, the Great Texas Freeze caused a billion dollars\u2019 worth of damages, state-wide blackouts, hundreds of fatalities, and enacted a massive emotional and financial toll on Texas residents.\nFor more details and graphs on February 2021\u2019s winter events, visit NCEI\u2019s Assessing the U.S. Climate web story and National Climate Monthly Report.

In 2021, fluctuations to the polar vortex were responsible for the coldest February since 1989. According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), natural disruptions caused the polar vortex to weaken, wobble, and slip southward off the pole. The extreme weather event brought record-low temperatures to a large portion of central Canada, the United States and even northern Mexico. Temperatures recorded during February fell as much as 25 to 50\u00b0F below average.\nSouthern states in the U.S. were the most affected by the descending Arctic air, particularly in Texas and parts of Oklahoma and Arkansas. Other weather patterns interacted with the cold front to cause an unprecedented band of freezing air to linger over the South for most of early February.\nFurthermore, severe winter storms during February brought heavy snowfall and treacherous icy conditions to large communities such as Houston, which rarely see snow at all. In Texas, the cold front caused further damage by putting significant strain on the municipal power grid and water supply. Millions of Texans lost power during the storm and were unable to heat their homes or prevent their water pipes from bursting. At least 217 people were killed directly or indirectly by the severe cold, and property damages were estimated to be at least $195 billion.\nMaking matters worse, the state\u2019s power plants were not prepared to handle the sustained freezing conditions that are rare in Texas. The power grid failures led to further shortages in basic food supplies and clean drinking water as the winter storm interfered with supply chains and municipal plumbing grids. These shortages also made it harder for hospitals to care for thousands of patients suffering from hypothermia (subnormal body temperature) and other injuries caused by the storm. For those sticking it out at home, Texans were advised to boil their tap water to prevent risk of illness until wastewater treatment facilities could get back online.\nNatural gas was hit the hardest of all the utilities in Texas because both the production and distribution pipelines froze and shut down. The problem only worsened as millions of freezing Texans turned up their heat. The abrupt spike in demand for natural gas for heating purposes led to shortages at power plants using natural gas to produce electricity. Some natural gas providers even took their power plants completely offline to avoid paying the high cost of fuel and to avoid long-term damage to their facilities. With coal, wind, and nuclear power plants also stressed with their own power shortages, the state\u2019s energy grid collapsed in a time of great need.\nWhat is the polar vortex? In recent years, \u201cpolar vortex\u201d has become a commonly used term during winter weather reports throughout North America. While many people would recognize this phrase or use it to describe colder than usual weather, its scientific meaning is complex and the natural phenomenon\u2019s connection to climate change is still largely unknown.\nIn essence, the polar vortex is a band of westerly winds that accumulates between 10 and 30 miles above the North Pole every winter (there is a similar polar vortex at the South Pole but it has less effect on weather in the Northern Hemisphere). Surrounding the vortex at lower altitude in the troposphere \u2013 5 to 9 miles above the surface \u2013 the polar jet stream works to keep this large body of extremely cold air contained in the stratosphere.\nIsolated from warmer latitudes by the polar jet stream below, the air inside the vortex grows progressively colder throughout the winter. During a normal winter when the polar vortex is stable, the polar jet stream is able to shift northward and more firmly contain the vortex of cold air (left diagram). In this scenario, the coldest polar air remains in the Arctic, resulting in milder weather in the mid-latitudes.\nConversely, in years when the polar vortex weakens or shifts, the polar jet stream can become wavier, lose strength, slow down, or sometimes reverse. These disruptions to the polar vortex\u2019s usual position are called sudden stratospheric warmings because they allow warm air from the south to be pulled into the Arctic, which can contribute to glacial melt. When this happens, the displaced polar air is pushed south into the mid-latitudes, which can consequently cause the freezing temperatures and inclement winter weather the polar vortex is known for in America (right diagram). This phenomenon naturally occurs every few years but is hard to predict or prepare for.\nAre severe winter storms caused by the polar vortex linked to climate change? The extreme cold in the Southern Plains during February 2021 also coincided with warmer-than- average temperatures in the Arctic. It follows to wonder if changes in the frequency and severity of polar vortex fluctuation events is caused by or contributing to global warming. Are severe winter weather outbreaks in the mid-latitudes becoming more likely?\nBecause disruptions of the polar vortex occur when the polar jet stream below it is altered, any forces \u2013 including changes to surface and sea temperature that impact the strength or location of the polar jet stream \u2013 can act to initiate a release of cold air from the Arctic. It appears that warming in the Arctic and diminishing sea ice is causing the polar jet stream to meander irregularly in at least two places, which makes it more likely to disrupt the polar vortex. So it is plausible that even though there is an overall warming trend on Earth due to human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, we may see an increase in the severity of winter weather events in the mid-latitude regions of North America and Eurasia due to interactions of the warming with the polar vortex.\nOn the other hand, outbreaks of cold Arctic air ar\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

What might have been a rare opportunity for residents to experience significant snow accumulation turned catastrophic as power blackouts spanned most of the state from Feb. 15-18. A survey conducted by the University of Houston (UH) Hobby School of Public Affairs in mid-March found that more than two out of three, or 69 percent, of Texans lost power at some point during Feb. 14-20, and almost half, or about 49 percent, had disruptions in water service. The storm contributed to at least 210 deaths, and sources cited by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas estimated the state\u2019s storm-related financial losses would range from $80 billion to $130 billion.\nLike many other things in Texas, energy is big, and much of it also is independent. That independence extends to Texas\u2019 unique place as the only state in the continental United States that is not substantially interconnected with either the Eastern Interconnection or the Western Interconnection (Exhibit 1). The Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC) regulates the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which manages the electricity grid.\nSource: ERCOT\nMore than 26 million Texas customers, or nearly 90 percent of the state\u2019s population, depend on ERCOT for electricity services. ERCOT does not have its own grid infrastructure but instead relies on power generation companies, electricity providers/utilities (i.e., investor-owned and municipally owned providers, electric cooperatives and the river authorities), and transmission and distribution utilities that participate in the wholesale energy market.\nTexas energy is generated from a variety of sources (PDF) with the majority supplied by natural gas, wind and coal \u2014 51 percent, 24.8 percent and 13.4 percent, respectively (Exhibit 2). More than 1,800 active market participants generate, move, buy, sell or use wholesale electricity, and ERCOT works with them to provide individual consumers with electricity. To ensure that the process runs smoothly, ERCOT produces seasonal planning reports to prepare for changes in weather and demand, as well as for potential emergencies based on historical data and planned outages for maintenance as well as other similar purposes.\nSource: ERCOT\nWinter Storm Uri far exceeded the parameters of ERCOT\u2019s seasonal planning. According to the National Weather Service, freezing rain and drizzle coated North and Central Texas as the storm began rolling in on Feb. 11, 2021, causing up to one-half inch of ice accumulation in some locations. Snow later followed on Feb. 14-17, with 5 inches recorded at Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) International Airport and 4.6 inches recorded at Waco Regional Airport. DFW recorded 139 consecutive hours of at or below freezing temperatures, and the Waco airport recorded 205 consecutive hours.\nGov. Greg Abbott issued a state of emergency declaration (PDF) on Feb. 12 due to the severity of the storm. On Feb. 13, some electricity generators began experiencing outages, and on Feb. 14, ERCOT issued a public plea for customers to reduce energy usage after power generation could not be increased to meet demand. As the grid continued to struggle to meet demand, controlled blackouts occurred, and on Feb. 15, ERCOT issued a declaration of emergency. According to a University of Texas at Austin (UT-Austin) Energy Report (PDF), the grid did not normalize until Feb. 19 and narrowly missed a catastrophic failure that potentially could have caused a total blackout throughout the state.\nThe UT-Austin report found that Uri, although not the most severe Texas winter storm on record, caused the most loss of electricity. The report also stated that rolling blackouts were intended to take stress off the power grid but turned into outages that \u2014 in some parts of the state \u2014 lasted several days. According to the report, multiple factors caused those extended blackouts, including that ERCOT underestimated peak demand by nearly 14 percent and weather forecasts misjudged the severity and timing of the storm.\nWhile planned generator outages fell within the appropriate range listed in ERCOT\u2019s seasonal plan, the report found that outages were still high in number. Additionally, energy power generators failed on all fronts, including those powered by natural gas, wind and coal.\nSource: University of Houston, Hobby School of Public Affairs, \u201cThe Winter Storm of 2021\u201d survey\nAs mentioned, 210 people perished because of Winter Storm Uri. According to the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS), most fatalities can be attributed to hypothermia, vehicle crashes, carbon monoxide poisoning and chronic medical conditions complicated by the storm. (DSHS continues to monitor and update this figure as new information becomes available.)\nMany residents found conditions within their homes unbearable, with indoor temperatures at or below freezing. Texas residents who were dependent on electrically powered medical equipment were especially vulnerable. According to the UH survey, of the 69 percent of Texans who lost power during the storm, their average disruption was 42 hours \u2014 31 of those consecutive. And of the 49 percent of Texans who lost running water, their average disruption was 52 hours (Exhibit 3).\nIn addition to electricity and other utility disruptions, Texas residents experienced a host of negative effects from the winter storm (Exhibit 4). The UH survey found that three-quarters of respondents had difficulty procuring food and groceries. Meanwhile, 31 percent had water damage to their residences, and of those, only 18 percent believed insurance would likely cover the damage.\nSource: University of Houston, Hobby School of Public Affairs, \u201cThe Winter Storm of 2021\u201d survey\nA recent study by the Texas Real Estate Center at Texas A&M University reported that, in 2019, 11 percent of homeowners in metropolitan areas had n\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

    "input_prompt": "Claim:\nReliable energy capacity in Texas was shrinking while unreliable capacity was surging.\n\nArticle Title:\nThe future of Texas power\n\nGoogle Search Snippet:\nAccurate load forecasting is the linchpin to maintaining grid reliability, optimizing power system operations and planning future infrastructure investments.\n\nFull Page Content:\nBalancing demand and reliability\nSEPTEMBER 2024 | BY JESS DONALD AND SPENCER GRUBBS\nIn May 2024, Texas set a daily power consumption record for the month six times. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) anticipates that this trend will continue, with predictions of above-normal temperatures and potentially below-normal rainfall straining the state's power grid as residents and businesses crank up their air conditioning. With a rapidly growing population and economy, it is vital that Texas remains powered.\nTo keep the state\u2019s electric grid running smoothly, ERCOT forecasts demand to ensure there are no disruptions or shortages in electric supply. However, forecasting energy demand is as complicated as it is essential. Grid operators use variables from numerous sources and, even so, revisions are necessary.\nFrom artificial intelligence to electric vehicles, business growth and power-hungry tech applications are driving up energy demand, making accurate forecasting crucial. This article delves into the intricacies of demand projections, including recent changes in ERCOT\u2019s planning methods and the various factors that Texas' electric grid operators must account for in real time.\nERCOT functions independently from other U.S. grids and is therefore not subject to the same federal regulations. ERCOT\u2019s grid operators are vigilant in their work to balance supply and demand because when the power goes off to consumers, crises can occur, including, tragically, the loss of Texans\u2019 lives.\nLoad forecasting \u2014 the science of predicting electricity demand \u2014 is essential for ensuring enough resources are allocated to meet energy needs. Accurate load forecasting is the linchpin to maintaining grid reliability, optimizing power system operations and planning future infrastructure investments.\nThe process is typically divided into three categories:\nERCOT employs a sophisticated load forecasting model that melds various technical specifics and data sources to safeguard the grid's reliability. The forecasting process (PDF) hinges on several factors including:\nThe need to revise forecasts is crucial to adapt to changing conditions and improve accuracy. Load forecasts can shift abruptly. Take, for instance, the revelation this June by ERCOT's CEO, who delivered a jaw-dropping new estimate saying Texas power needs would far surpass earlier projections due to factors including growth, weather and a new state law changing forecast parameters (Exhibit 1). These sudden changes demand swift recalibrations in energy planning and resource management by ERCOT, often under intense scrutiny.\nSource: ERCOT\nPeak consumer demand for electricity on the Texas grid ballooned in summer 2023, setting a record at 85.508 gigawatts on Aug. 10 (Exhibit 2). This record is more than 14 percent higher than the peak demand in August 2019.\n*Records are unofficial until final settlements occur.\nSource: ERCOT\nBut by 2030, peak demand could nearly double to 150 GW, ERCOT CEO Pablo Vegas told the Senate Committee on Business and Commerce on June 12. \u201cIt's a fairly significant step change from a demand perspective,\u201d said Vegas. \u201cAll of that [demand] may not come, but even if a significant portion of it does, it's a really significant growth number.\u201d\nSpikes in demand on the grid especially since 2020 result from a myriad of interrelated factors in Texas, including population growth, extreme weather patterns, the proliferation of electric vehicles, and the expanding footprint of data centers, artificial intelligence, and cryptocurrency mining. ERCOT\u2019s forecast also was affected by a new law prescribing how to estimate growth.\nTexas\u2019 population is booming \u2014 and it has been for more than a decade. In 2022, Texas joined California as the only other state with a population of 30 million or more. Between 2012 and 2022, the state\u2019s population grew by 3.9 million, or 15 percent, the largest growth among all states and more than double the U.S. growth of 6.2 percent.
