    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nI\u2019m an atmospheric physicist. I\u2019ve published more than 200 scientific papers. For 30 years I taught at MIT, during which time the climate has changed remarkably little. But the cry of \u201cglobal warming\u201d has grown ever more shrill. In fact, it seems that the less the climate changes, the louder the voices of the climate alarmists get. So, let\u2019s clear the air and create a more accurate picture of where we really stand on the issue of global warming or, as it is now called -- climate change. There are basically three groups of people dealing with this issue. Groups one and two are scientists. Group three consists mostly, at its core, of politicians, environmentalists and media. Group one is associated with the scientific part of the United Nation\u2019s International Panel on Climate Change or IPCC (Working Group 1). These are scientists who mostly believe that recent climate change is primarily due to man\u2019s burning of fossil fuels -- oil, coal and natural gas. This releases C02, carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere and, they believe, this might eventually dangerously heat the planet. Group two is made up of scientists who don\u2019t see this as an especially serious problem. This is the group I belong to. We\u2019re usually referred to as skeptics. We note that there are many reasons why the climate changes -- the sun, clouds, oceans, the orbital variations of the earth, as well as a myriad of other inputs. None of these is fully understood, and there is no evidence that CO2 emissions are the dominant factor. But actually there is much agreement between both groups of scientists. The following are such points of agreement: 1) The climate is always changing. 2) CO2 is a greenhouse gas without which life on earth is not possible, but adding it to the atmosphere should lead to some warming. 3) Atmospheric levels of CO2 have been increasing since the end of the Little Ice Age in the 19th century. 4) Over this period (the past two centuries), the global mean temperature has increased slightly and erratically by about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit or one degree Celsius; but only since the 1960\u2019s have man\u2019s greenhouse emissions been sufficient to play a role. 5) Given the complexity of climate, no confident prediction about future global mean temperature or its impact can be made. The IPCC, acknowledged in its own 2007 report that \u201cThe long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible.\u201d Most importantly, the scenario that the burning of fossil fuels leads to catastrophe isn\u2019t part of what either group asserts. So why are so many people worried, indeed, panic stricken about this issue. Here\u2019s where Group Three comes in -- the politicians, environmentalists, and media. Global Warming Alarmism provides them, more than any other issue, with the things they most want: For politicians it\u2019s money and power. For environmentalists it\u2019s money for their organizations and confirmation of their near religious devotion to the idea that man is a destructive force acting upon nature. And for the media it\u2019s ideology, money, and headlines -- doomsday scenarios sell. Meanwhile, over the last decade, scientists outside of climate physics have jumped on the bandwagon, publishing papers blaming global warming for everything from acne to the Syrian civil war. And, crony capitalists have eagerly grabbed for the subsidies that governments have so lavishly provided. Unfortunately, group three is winning the argument because they have drowned out the serious debate that should be going on. But while politicians, environmentalists and media types can waste a lot of money and scare a lot of people, they won\u2019t be able to bury the truth. The climate will have the final word on that.

LINDZEN, June 26, 2006) June 27, 2006 - There Is No 'Consensus' On Global Warming By RICHARD S. LINDZEN Mr. Lindzen is the Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Atmospheric Science at MIT. June 26, 2006; Page A14 According to Al Gore's new film \"An Inconvenient Truth,\" we're in for \"a planetary emergency\": melting ice sheets, huge increases in sea levels, more and stronger hurricanes and invasions of tropical disease, among other cataclysms -- unless we change the way we live now\u2026 Mr. Gore assures us that \"the debate in the scientific community is over.\" That statement, which Mr. Gore made in an interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC, ought to have been followed by an asterisk. What exactly is this debate that Mr. Gore is referring to? Is there really a scientific community that is debating all these issues and then somehow agreeing in unison? Far from such a thing being over, it has never been clear to me what this \"debate\" actually is in the first place. The media rarely help, of course. When Newsweek featured global warming in a 1988 issue, it was claimed that all scientists agreed. Periodically thereafter it was revealed that although there had been lingering doubts beforehand, now all scientists did indeed agree. Even Mr. Gore qualified his statement on ABC only a few minutes after he made it, clarifying things in an important way. When Mr. Stephanopoulos confronted Mr. Gore with the fact that the best estimates of rising sea levels are far less dire than he suggests in his movie, Mr. Gore defended his claims by noting that scientists \"don't have any models that give them a high level of confidence\" one way or the other and went on to claim -- in his defense -- that scientists \"don't know\u2026 They just don't know.\" So, presumably, those scientists do not belong to the \"consensus.\" Yet their research is forced, whether the evidence supports it or not, into Mr. Gore's preferred global-warming template -- namely, shrill alarmism. To believe it requires that one ignore the truly inconvenient facts. To take the issue of rising sea levels, these include: that the Arctic was as warm or warmer in 1940; that icebergs have been known since time immemorial; that the evidence so far suggests that the Greenland ice sheet is actually growing on average. A likely result of all this is increased pressure pushing ice off the coastal perimeter of that country, which is depicted so ominously in Mr. Gore's movie. In the absence of factual context, these images are perhaps dire or alarming. They are less so otherwise. Alpine glaciers have been retreating since the early 19th century, and were advancing for several centuries before that. Since about 1970, many of the glaciers have stopped retreating and some are now advancing again. And, frankly, we don't know why\u2026 * * * A general characteristic of Mr. Gore's approach is to assiduously ignore the fact that the earth and its climate are dynamic; they are always changing even without any external forcing. To treat all change as something to fear is bad enough; to do so in order to exploit that fear is much worse. Regardless, these items are clearly not issues over which debate is ended -- at least not in terms of the actual science. A clearer claim as to what debate has ended is provided by the environmental journalist Gregg Easterbrook. He concludes that the scientific community now agrees that significant warming is occurring, and that there is clear evidence of human influences on the climate system. This is still a most peculiar claim. At some level, it has never been widely contested. Most of the climate community has agreed since 1988 that global mean temperatures have increased on the order of one degree Fahrenheit over the past century, having risen significantly from about 1919 to 1940, decreased between 1940 and the early '70s, increased again until the '90s, and remaining essentially flat since 1998\u2026 Given that we do not understand the natural internal variability of climate change, this task is currently impossible. Nevertheless there has been a persistent effort to suggest otherwise, and with surprising impact. Thus, although the conflicted state of the affair was accurately presented in the 1996 text of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the infamous \"summary for policy makers\" reported ambiguously that \"The balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate.\" This sufficed as the smoking gun for Kyoto. The next IPCC report again described the problems surrounding what has become known as the attribution issue: that is, to explain what mechanisms are responsible for observed changes in climate. Some deployed the lassitude argument -- e.g., we can't think of an alternative -- to support human attribution. But the \"summary for policy makers\" claimed in a manner largely unrelated to the actual text of the report that \"In the light of new evidence and taking into account the remaining uncertainties, most of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations.\" In a similar vein, the National Academy of Sciences issued a brief (15-page) report responding to questions from the White House. It again enumerated the difficulties with attribution, but again the report was preceded by a front end that ambiguously claimed that \"The changes observed over the last several decades are likely mostly due to human activities, but we cannot rule out that some significant part of these changes is also a reflection of natural variability.\" This was sufficient for CNN's Michelle Mitchell to presciently declare that the report represented a \"unanimous decision that global warming is real, is getting worse and is due to man. There is no wiggle room.\" Well, no. More recently, a study in the journal \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

LINDZEN, June 26, 2006) June 27, 2006 - There Is No 'Consensus' On Global Warming By RICHARD S. LINDZEN Mr. Lindzen is the Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Atmospheric Science at MIT. June 26, 2006; Page A14 According to Al Gore's new film \"An Inconvenient Truth,\" we're in for \"a planetary emergency\": melting ice sheets, huge increases in sea levels, more and stronger hurricanes and invasions of tropical disease, among other cataclysms -- unless we change the way we live now\u2026 Mr. Gore assures us that \"the debate in the scientific community is over.\" That statement, which Mr. Gore made in an interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC, ought to have been followed by an asterisk. What exactly is this debate that Mr. Gore is referring to? Is there really a scientific community that is debating all these issues and then somehow agreeing in unison? Far from such a thing being over, it has never been clear to me what this \"debate\" actually is in the first place. The media rarely help, of course. When Newsweek featured global warming in a 1988 issue, it was claimed that all scientists agreed. Periodically thereafter it was revealed that although there had been lingering doubts beforehand, now all scientists did indeed agree. Even Mr. Gore qualified his statement on ABC only a few minutes after he made it, clarifying things in an important way. When Mr. Stephanopoulos confronted Mr. Gore with the fact that the best estimates of rising sea levels are far less dire than he suggests in his movie, Mr. Gore defended his claims by noting that scientists \"don't have any models that give them a high level of confidence\" one way or the other and went on to claim -- in his defense -- that scientists \"don't know\u2026 They just don't know.\" So, presumably, those scientists do not belong to the \"consensus.\" Yet their research is forced, whether the evidence supports it or not, into Mr. Gore's preferred global-warming template -- namely, shrill alarmism. To believe it requires that one ignore the truly inconvenient facts. To take the issue of rising sea levels, these include: that the Arctic was as warm or warmer in 1940; that icebergs have been known since time immemorial; that the evidence so far suggests that the Greenland ice sheet is actually growing on average. A likely result of all this is increased pressure pushing ice off the coastal perimeter of that country, which is depicted so ominously in Mr. Gore's movie. In the absence of factual context, these images are perhaps dire or alarming. They are less so otherwise. Alpine glaciers have been retreating since the early 19th century, and were advancing for several centuries before that. Since about 1970, many of the glaciers have stopped retreating and some are now advancing again. And, frankly, we don't know why\u2026 * * * A general characteristic of Mr. Gore's approach is to assiduously ignore the fact that the earth and its climate are dynamic; they are always changing even without any external forcing. To treat all change as something to fear is bad enough; to do so in order to exploit that fear is much worse. Regardless, these items are clearly not issues over which debate is ended -- at least not in terms of the actual science. A clearer claim as to what debate has ended is provided by the environmental journalist Gregg Easterbrook. He concludes that the scientific community now agrees that significant warming is occurring, and that there is clear evidence of human influences on the climate system. This is still a most peculiar claim. At some level, it has never been widely contested. Most of the climate community has agreed since 1988 that global mean temperatures have increased on the order of one degree Fahrenheit over the past century, having risen significantly from about 1919 to 1940, decreased between 1940 and the early '70s, increased again until the '90s, and remaining essentially flat since 1998\u2026 Given that we do not understand the natural internal variability of climate change, this task is currently impossible. Nevertheless there has been a persistent effort to suggest otherwise, and with surprising impact. Thus, although the conflicted state of the affair was accurately presented in the 1996 text of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the infamous \"summary for policy makers\" reported ambiguously that \"The balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate.\" This sufficed as the smoking gun for Kyoto. The next IPCC report again described the problems surrounding what has become known as the attribution issue: that is, to explain what mechanisms are responsible for observed changes in climate. Some deployed the lassitude argument -- e.g., we can't think of an alternative -- to support human attribution. But the \"summary for policy makers\" claimed in a manner largely unrelated to the actual text of the report that \"In the light of new evidence and taking into account the remaining uncertainties, most of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations.\" In a similar vein, the National Academy of Sciences issued a brief (15-page) report responding to questions from the White House. It again enumerated the difficulties with attribution, but again the report was preceded by a front end that ambiguously claimed that \"The changes observed over the last several decades are likely mostly due to human activities, but we cannot rule out that some significant part of these changes is also a reflection of natural variability.\" This was sufficient for CNN's Michelle Mitchell to presciently declare that the report represented a \"unanimous decision that global warming is real, is getting worse and is due to man.

Data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment show Greenland lost an average of 279 billion tons of ice per year between 1993 and 2019, while Antarctica lost about 148 billion tons of ice per year.7 Image: The Antarctic Peninsula, Credit: NASA\nGlaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world \u2014 including in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska, and Africa.8 Image: Miles Glacier, Alaska Image credit: NASA\nSatellite observations reveal that the amount of spring snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere has decreased over the past five decades and the snow is melting earlier.9 Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\nGlobal sea level rose about 8 inches (20 centimeters) in the last century.

June 26, 2006; Page A14 According to Al Gore's new film \"An Inconvenient Truth,\" we're in for \"a planetary emergency\": melting ice sheets, huge increases in sea levels, more and stronger hurricanes and invasions of tropical disease, among other cataclysms -- unless we change the way we live now\u2026 Mr. Gore assures us that \"the debate in the scientific community is over.\" That statement, which Mr. Gore made in an interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC, ought to have been followed by an asterisk. What exactly is this debate that Mr. Gore is referring to? Is there really a scientific community that is debating all these issues and then somehow agreeing in unison? Far from such a thing being over, it has never been clear to me what this \"debate\" actually is in the first place. The media rarely help, of course. When Newsweek featured global warming in a 1988 issue, it was claimed that all scientists agreed. Periodically thereafter it was revealed that although there had been lingering doubts beforehand, now all scientists did indeed agree. Even Mr. Gore qualified his statement on ABC only a few minutes after he made it, clarifying things in an important way. When Mr. Stephanopoulos confronted Mr. Gore with the fact that the best estimates of rising sea levels are far less dire than he suggests in his movie, Mr. Gore defended his claims by noting that scientists \"don't have any models that give them a high level of confidence\" one way or the other and went on to claim -- in his defense -- that scientists \"don't know\u2026 They just don't know.\" So, presumably, those scientists do not belong to the \"consensus.\" Yet their research is forced, whether the evidence supports it or not, into Mr. Gore's preferred global-warming template -- namely, shrill alarmism. To believe it requires that one ignore the truly inconvenient facts. To take the issue of rising sea levels, these include: that the Arctic was as warm or warmer in 1940; that icebergs have been known since time immemorial; that the evidence so far suggests that the Greenland ice sheet is actually growing on average. A likely result of all this is increased pressure pushing ice off the coastal perimeter of that country, which is depicted so ominously in Mr. Gore's movie. In the absence of factual context, these images are perhaps dire or alarming. They are less so otherwise. Alpine glaciers have been retreating since the early 19th century, and were advancing for several centuries before that. Since about 1970, many of the glaciers have stopped retreating and some are now advancing again. And, frankly, we don't know why\u2026 * * * A general characteristic of Mr. Gore's approach is to assiduously ignore the fact that the earth and its climate are dynamic; they are always changing even without any external forcing. To treat all change as something to fear is bad enough; to do so in order to exploit that fear is much worse. Regardless, these items are clearly not issues over which debate is ended -- at least not in terms of the actual science. A clearer claim as to what debate has ended is provided by the environmental journalist Gregg Easterbrook. He concludes that the scientific community now agrees that significant warming is occurring, and that there is clear evidence of human influences on the climate system. This is still a most peculiar claim. At some level, it has never been widely contested. Most of the climate community has agreed since 1988 that global mean temperatures have increased on the order of one degree Fahrenheit over the past century, having risen significantly from about 1919 to 1940, decreased between 1940 and the early '70s, increased again until the '90s, and remaining essentially flat since 1998\u2026 Given that we do not understand the natural internal variability of climate change, this task is currently impossible. Nevertheless there has been a persistent effort to suggest otherwise, and with surprising impact. Thus, although the conflicted state of the affair was accurately presented in the 1996 text of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the infamous \"summary for policy makers\" reported ambiguously that \"The balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate.\" This sufficed as the smoking gun for Kyoto. The next IPCC report again described the problems surrounding what has become known as the attribution issue: that is, to explain what mechanisms are responsible for observed changes in climate. Some deployed the lassitude argument -- e.g., we can't think of an alternative -- to support human attribution. But the \"summary for policy makers\" claimed in a manner largely unrelated to the actual text of the report that \"In the light of new evidence and taking into account the remaining uncertainties, most of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations.\" In a similar vein, the National Academy of Sciences issued a brief (15-page) report responding to questions from the White House. It again enumerated the difficulties with attribution, but again the report was preceded by a front end that ambiguously claimed that \"The changes observed over the last several decades are likely mostly due to human activities, but we cannot rule out that some significant part of these changes is also a reflection of natural variability.\" This was sufficient for CNN's Michelle Mitchell to presciently declare that the report represented a \"unanimous decision that global warming is real, is getting worse and is due to man.

It plays an important role in photosynthesis, in which plants convert CO\u2082 into oxygen. At the same time, CO\u2082 is a significant greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming and climate change. Its concentration is influenced by natural processes and human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels. Monitoring and controlling CO\u2082 emissions are therefore central to environmental protection and climate policy.\nCarbon dioxide (CO\u2082) is an essential component of our atmosphere and is non-toxic, colourless and odourless in gaseous form under natural conditions. The role of CO\u2082 in our climate is crucial: it absorbs some of the heat radiated from the earth and reflects it back to the earth's surface. This natural greenhouse effect regulates the climate on our planet and creates the conditions in which flora and fauna can thrive.\nCO\u2082 is produced as a natural by-product of cellular respiration in numerous living organisms, the decay of dead organisms and the combustion of organic materials such as wood, coal and gas, or even from natural sources of CO\u2082 (e.g. underwater volcanoes and hydrothermal vents). CO\u2082 sinks are essential to close the natural carbon cycle. In nature, CO\u2082 is broken down by plants through photosynthesis or physically dissolved and stored by bodies of water such as seas and oceans.\nCO\u2082 (carbon dioxide) plays a central role in climate change as it is one of the most important greenhouse gases.

LINDZEN, MIT PROFESSOR OF ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE- On Global Warming Fears: I think it's mainly just like little kids locking themselves in dark closets to see how much they can scare each other and themselves.\nAnd there's a lot of confusion in this and, you know, at the heart of it, we're talking of a few tenths of a degree change in temperature. None of it in the last eight years, by the way. And if we had warming, it should be accomplished by less storminess. But because the temperature itself is so unspectacular, we have developed all sorts of fear of prospect scenarios -- of flooding, of plague, of increased storminess when the physics says we should see less.\nLindzen on \u2018Symbolic\u2019 Solutions to Global Warming Lindzen:\n\"[I]f there's anything that there is a consensus on, [it is that we] will do very little to affect climate. So right now despite all of the claims to the contrary, we're talking about symbolism. And I think Julian's point is correct. Do you spend a lot? Do you distort a great deal in the economy for symbolism? And I think future generations are not going to blame us for anything except for being silly, for letting a few tenths of a degree panic us.\nAnd I think nobody is arguing about whether our climate is changing. It's always changing. Sea level has been rising since the end of the last ice age. The experts on it in the IPCC have freely acknowledged there's no strong evidence it's accelerating.\nLindzen Says UN IPCC does not Reflect Thousands of Scientists \u2013 Only a Dozen or so Scientists:\nSenator Inhofe was absolutely right. All that's coming out Friday is a summary for policymakers that is not prepared by scientists. Rob is wrong. It's not 2,500 people offering their consensus, I participated in that. Each person who is an author writes one or two pages in conjunction with someone else. They travel around the world several times a year for several years to write it and the summary for policymakers has the input of about 13 of the scientists, but ultimately, it is written by representatives of governments, of environmental organizations like the Union of Concerned Scientists, and industrial organizations, each seeking their own benefit.\nLindzen Debates Bill Nye, PBS TV\u2019s the \"Science Guy\" on Scientific Accuracy\nLINDZEN: Not at all. I think time will tell. I think Mr. Nye is speaking about energy. Energy sources and balance have changed over time, it will change. I have no idea what the energy mix will be 50 years from now. But I think if what he says about profitable, better sources are there, they will come online and they will come online without government fiat. Heidi [Cullen] says the science is solid and I can't criticize her because she never says what science she's talking about. This is a problem with so many facets, that the notion that scientists are in lock, that bonnet is silly.\nLARRY KING: Yes.\nBill Nye, where is Richard Lindzen wrong?\nBILL NYE, \"THE SCIENCE GUY,\" SCIENTIST, BEST-SELLING AUTHOR, TV PERSONALITY: Well, he -- I'm not sure, because I'm not -- I'm not an expert on his ideas.\nBut the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change, the IPCC report, which comes out Friday, is pretty compelling. And, as you know, I'm a member of the advisory board of the Union of Concerned Scientists and I find my colleagues pretty compelling, much more so than his -- his view is -- is a minority on a scale that's -- that's impressive. It's probably 100,000 to one or so, scientists versus him.\nKING: All right, Richard, are you... NYE: But I don't want it to get to be a personal attack. And...\nKING: OK, Richard, are you -- are you one of the alone ones in this?\nLINDZEN: You know, on what I was just saying, I was saying textbook material. And if the textbooks are out voiced by environmental advocacy groups like Union of Concerned Scientists by 100,000 to one -- that would be bizarre.

Records of historical climate conditions are preserved in tree rings, locked in the skeletons of tropical coral reefs, sealed in glaciers and ice caps, and buried in laminated sediments from lakes and the ocean.\nScientists can use those environmental recorders to estimate past conditions, extending our understanding of climate back hundreds to millions of years.\nGlobal-scale observations from the instrumental era began in the mid-19th century, and paleoclimate reconstructions extend the record of some quantities back hundreds to millions of years. Together, this provides a comprehensive view of the variability and long-term changes in the atmosphere, the ocean, the cryosphere and at the land surface.\nThe Earth\u2019s climate is changing, and it is projected to continue changing over the next century.\nThe magnitude of climate change beyond the next few decades will depend primarily on the amount of greenhouse (heat-trapping) gases emitted globally and on the remaining uncertainty about the Earth\u2019s climate's sensitivity to those emissions.\nWith significant reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the global annual average temperature rise could be limited to 2\u00b0C or less. However, without major reductions in these emissions, the increase in annual average global temperatures relative to preindustrial times could reach 5\u00b0C or more by the end of this century.\nThe global climate continues to change rapidly compared to the pace of natural climate variations throughout Earth\u2019s history. Trends in globally averaged temperature, sea level rise, upper-ocean heat content, land-based ice melt, arctic sea ice, depth of seasonal permafrost thaw, and other climate variables provide consistent evidence of a warming planet.\nThese observed trends are robust and confirmed by multiple independent research groups worldwide. Figure 1 shows global average temperature anomalies; since the 1880s, the global average temperature has warmed approximately 1\u00b0C.\nFIGURE 2\nThe period from 1983 to 2012 was likely the warmest 30-year period of the last 800 years and likely the warmest 30-year period of the previous 1400 years.\nFigure 4a shows the radiative forcing (W/m2) due to volcanic, solar, and well-mixed greenhouse gases (WMGHGs). Different colors illustrate the two existing data sets for volcanic forcing and four estimates of solar forcing and the grey line represents WMGHGs for the period from 850 to 2000.\nFigure 4b represents the simulated (red) and reconstructed (gray) Northern Hemisphere temperature anomalies for the period from 850 to 2000. The thick red line depicts the multi-model mean while the thin red lines show the multi-model 90% range. The overlap of reconstructed temperatures is shown by grey shading.\nIn Figure 3, model projections indicate that twenty-first-century global average warming will substantially exceed the Last Glacial Maximum period and even the warmest Holocene conditions, producing a climate state not previously experienced.\nFIGURE 3\nThe period from 1983 to 2012 was likely the warmest 30-year period of the last 800 years and likely the warmest 30-year period of the previous 1400 years.\nModel-simulated global temperature anomalies for the Last Glacial Maximum (21,000 years ago), the mid-Holocene (6,000 years ago), and projection for 2071\u20132095, under RCP8.5.\nEarth\u2019s climate is now changing faster than at any point in the known history of the climate, primarily as a result of human activities.\nThere is scientific consensus that unmitigated carbon emissions will lead to global warming of at least several degrees Celsius by 2100, resulting in high-impacts of local, regional and global risks to human society and natural ecosystems. Global climate change has already resulted in a wide range of impacts across every region of the earth as well as many economic sectors.\nImpacts related to climate change are evident across regions and in many sectors important to society, such as human health, agriculture and food security, water supply, transportation, energy, and biodiversity and ecosystems; impacts are expected to become increasingly disruptive in the coming decades.\nThere is very high confidence that the frequency and intensity of extreme heat and heavy precipitation events are increasing in most continental regions of the world. These trends are consistent with expected physical responses to a warming climate. The frequency and intensity of extreme high temperature events are virtually certain to increase in the future as global temperature increases.\nThere is high confidence that extreme precipitation events will very likely continue to increase in frequency and intensity throughout most of the world. Observed and projected trends for other types of extreme events, such as floods, droughts, and severe storms, have more variable regional characteristics.\nObserved changes over the 20th century include increases in global air and ocean temperature, rising global sea levels, long-term sustained widespread reduction of snow and ice cover, and changes in atmospheric and ocean circulation as well as regional weather patterns, which influence seasonal rainfall conditions.\nThese changes are caused by extra heat in the climate system due to the addition of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. These additional greenhouse gases are primarily input by human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), deforestation, agriculture, and land-use changes. These activities increase the amount of \u2018heat-trapping\u2019 greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\nThe pattern of observed changes in the climate system is consistent with an increased greenhouse effect. Other climatic influences such as volcanoes, the sun and natural variability cannot alone explain the timing and extent of the observed changes.\nClimate, refers to the long-term regional or global average of temperature, humid\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

One of the clearest signs is that the world is warming. Scientists know this through evidence compiled from satellites, weather balloons, thermometers, weather stations and more.1 Since 1880, average global temperatures have increased by about 1 degrees Celsius (1.7\u00b0 degrees Fahrenheit). Global temperature is projected to warm by about 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7\u00b0 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2050 and 2-4 degrees Celsius (3.6-7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100.2\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) [exit DNR], average annual global temperatures have increased steadily since the 1960s. Figure 1 shows deviations from the average global temperature depicted as the horizontal line at 0.00 degrees Celsius. Every blue bar is a year that was colder than the average temperature of the 20th century. Red bars are years that were warmer than the 20th century average. Nineteen of the 20 warmest years have occurred since 2001. It is likely that the coldest year moving forward will be warmer than the warmest year that we experienced in the 20th century.\nTo determine changes in Wisconsin temperature and precipitation, scientists from the University of Wisconsin-Madison analyzed temperature records from a statewide network compiled by the National Climatic Data Center. This dataset shows that Wisconsin has become 2 degrees Fahrenheit warmer and 4.5 inches (14 percent) wetter since the 1950s, with the greatest warming during winter and the largest precipitation increase during summer (Figure 2).\nRecordings of daily atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), initiated by Dr. Charles David Keeling of the Scripps Institute of Oceanography, help to tell the story of increasing CO2 levels. Keeling was curious whether the increasing amounts of fossil fuel being combusted would affect atmospheric CO2 levels. So, in 1958 he began to record daily atmospheric CO2 levels at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. Mauna Loa was selected as a long-term monitoring site because it was far from other continents and vegetation that could affect the CO2 concentration. The daily recordings are considered one of the world\u2019s greatest scientific contributions.\nKeeling's measurements discovered an annual planetary cycle in CO2 , in which CO2 levels rise and fall seasonally (Figure 3). This cycle is tied to photosynthesis. In the spring as plants grow, they take carbon dioxide from the air and using the energy from sunlight, convert it into carbon and release oxygen. In the fall as plants die, they release CO2 and global CO2 readings rise.\nIn addition to the seasonal cycling, Keeling also recorded an increase in CO2 concentration over time, from 313 parts per million (ppm) in 1958 to 415 ppm as of March 30, 2020. This rise in CO2 concentration, known as the Keeling Curve has transformed the way scientists understand the source of CO2\nScientists understand the source of CO2 in the atmosphere from several lines of evidence, including measurements of Antarctic ice cores that go back 800,000 years. Antarctic ice cores contain our atmosphere\u2019s history in bubbles of air that were trapped hundreds of thousands of years ago when the ice was first formed. Scientists can analyze these bubbles to determine how CO2 levels have changed over time.3 The cores show that for the last 800,000 years, until about 1900, CO2 levels were relatively stable, fluctuating between about 150 and 280 ppm. In the early 1900s, CO2 started to increase at an unprecedented rate. Today, only 120 years later, CO2 levels are 40 percent higher than they were before the industrial revolution (Figure 4).\nCO2 emissions make up the vast majority of greenhouse gases (GHG) that warm the planet. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources Air Management Program has prepared the Wisconsin Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory (1990-2021) [PDF], identifying CO2 and other GHG emissions in Wisconsin for 2005 and 2021, and describing emission trends from 1990 through 2021. Report authors used the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s State Inventory Tool populated with default data.\nResearch conducted by the Wisconsin Initiative on Climate Change Impacts (WICCI) [exit DNR], a collaboration of more than 200 scientists and practitioners, provides useful information on the impacts of climate changes, adaptive strategies and solutions to both store carbon and reduce carbon emissions. The University of Wisconsin-Madison's Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources lead WICCI.\nWICCI climate scientists have been able to project local temperature and precipitation patterns for Wisconsin. The scientists took taking global climate models that simulate climate changes on a large scale (typically 100-200 miles) and downscaled them to approximately six miles. The downscaled models have allowed scientists to forecast more realistic, localized temperature and precipitation changes, and changes in extreme weather events. WICCI scientists are continuing to work with people around the state to fine-tune these models and provide forecasts for other climate factors that are important to impacts in Wisconsin.\nWisconsin is likely to become a much warmer state over the next few decades, with average temperatures closer to southern Illinois or Missouri.

LINDZEN, MIT PROFESSOR OF ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE- On Global Warming Fears: I think it's mainly just like little kids locking themselves in dark closets to see how much they can scare each other and themselves.\nAnd there's a lot of confusion in this and, you know, at the heart of it, we're talking of a few tenths of a degree change in temperature. None of it in the last eight years, by the way. And if we had warming, it should be accomplished by less storminess. But because the temperature itself is so unspectacular, we have developed all sorts of fear of prospect scenarios -- of flooding, of plague, of increased storminess when the physics says we should see less.\nLindzen on \u2018Symbolic\u2019 Solutions to Global Warming Lindzen:\n\"[I]f there's anything that there is a consensus on, [it is that we] will do very little to affect climate. So right now despite all of the claims to the contrary, we're talking about symbolism. And I think Julian's point is correct. Do you spend a lot? Do you distort a great deal in the economy for symbolism? And I think future generations are not going to blame us for anything except for being silly, for letting a few tenths of a degree panic us.\nAnd I think nobody is arguing about whether our climate is changing. It's always changing. Sea level has been rising since the end of the last ice age. The experts on it in the IPCC have freely acknowledged there's no strong evidence it's accelerating.\nLindzen Says UN IPCC does not Reflect Thousands of Scientists \u2013 Only a Dozen or so Scientists:\nSenator Inhofe was absolutely right. All that's coming out Friday is a summary for policymakers that is not prepared by scientists. Rob is wrong. It's not 2,500 people offering their consensus, I participated in that. Each person who is an author writes one or two pages in conjunction with someone else. They travel around the world several times a year for several years to write it and the summary for policymakers has the input of about 13 of the scientists, but ultimately, it is written by representatives of governments, of environmental organizations like the Union of Concerned Scientists, and industrial organizations, each seeking their own benefit.\nLindzen Debates Bill Nye, PBS TV\u2019s the \"Science Guy\" on Scientific Accuracy\nLINDZEN: Not at all. I think time will tell. I think Mr. Nye is speaking about energy. Energy sources and balance have changed over time, it will change. I have no idea what the energy mix will be 50 years from now. But I think if what he says about profitable, better sources are there, they will come online and they will come online without government fiat. Heidi [Cullen] says the science is solid and I can't criticize her because she never says what science she's talking about. This is a problem with so many facets, that the notion that scientists are in lock, that bonnet is silly.\nLARRY KING: Yes.\nBill Nye, where is Richard Lindzen wrong?\nBILL NYE, \"THE SCIENCE GUY,\" SCIENTIST, BEST-SELLING AUTHOR, TV PERSONALITY: Well, he -- I'm not sure, because I'm not -- I'm not an expert on his ideas.\nBut the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change, the IPCC report, which comes out Friday, is pretty compelling. And, as you know, I'm a member of the advisory board of the Union of Concerned Scientists and I find my colleagues pretty compelling, much more so than his -- his view is -- is a minority on a scale that's -- that's impressive. It's probably 100,000 to one or so, scientists versus him.\nKING: All right, Richard, are you... NYE: But I don't want it to get to be a personal attack. And...\nKING: OK, Richard, are you -- are you one of the alone ones in this?\nLINDZEN: You know, on what I was just saying, I was saying textbook material. And if the textbooks are out voiced by environmental advocacy groups like Union of Concerned Scientists by 100,000 to one -- that would be bizarre. We should close down our schools.\nThis makes no sense, what Mr. Nye is say\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Content is not being updated or maintained, and some links may no longer work.\nThe modern record of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels began with observations recorded at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. This graph shows the station's monthly average carbon dioxide measurements since 1958 in parts per million (ppm). The seasonal cycle of highs and lows (small peaks and valleys) is driven by Northern Hemisphere summer vegetation growth, which reduces atmospheric carbon dioxide, and winter decay, which increases it. The long-term trend of rising carbon dioxide levels is driven by human activities. At Mauna Loa, the highest monthly value each year occurs in May. In May 2024, carbon dioxide hit just under 427 ppm\u2014a new record. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on Mauna Loa monthly mean data from NOAA Global Monitoring Lab.\nBased on the annual analysis from NOAA\u2019s Global Monitoring Lab, global average atmospheric carbon dioxide was 422.8 parts per million (\u201cppm,\u201d for short) in 2024, a new record high. The increase during 2024 was 3.75 ppm\u2014the largest one-year increase on record. At Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii (graph above), where the modern carbon dioxide record began in 1958, the annual average carbon dioxide in 2024 was 424.61 ppm, also a new record.\nThe years with the largest annual carbon dioxide growth tend to be associated with the strongest El Ni\u00f1os\u2014the warm phase of a natural climate pattern in the tropical Pacific\u2014which lead to high temperatures over land and sea and an expansion of global drought area. In turn, these weather conditions typically lead to less plant growth, which reduces carbon dioxide uptake, as well as increased decomposition of carbon in soil and increased carbon dioxide emissions from forest fires. Together, these impacts cause atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to rise faster than normal.\nEven though the 2023-24 El Ni\u00f1o had waned by April, record high air temperatures and drought in all of 2024, similar to those during an El Nino, were likely drivers of the large increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide in 2024. In addition to other factors, large forest fires in both the Amazon and Canada contributed to the 2024 global increase.\nCarbon dioxide concentrations are rising mostly because of the fossil fuels that people have been burning for energy since the start of the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuels like coal and oil contain the carbon from millions of years of photosynthesis\u2014the process by which plants remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. We are returning that carbon to the atmosphere in just a few hundred years. Since the middle of the 20th century, annual emissions of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels have increased every decade, from close to 11 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year in the 1960s to an estimated 37.4 billion tons in 2024 according to the Global Carbon Budget 2024.\nThe amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (blue line) has increased along with human emissions (gray line) since the start of the Industrial Revolution in 1750. Emissions rose slowly to about 5 gigatons (1 gigaton is 1 billion metric tons per year) in the mid-20th century before rapidly increasing to more than 35 billion tons per year by the end of the century. NOAA Climate.gov graph, adapted from original by Dr. Howard Diamond (NOAA ARL). Atmospheric carbon dioxide data from NOAA and ETHZ. Carbon dioxide emissions data from Our World in Data and the Global Carbon Project.\nCarbon cycle experts estimate that natural \u201csinks,\u201d including plant growth and ocean absorption, remove about half of carbon dioxide humans emit into the atmosphere from fossil fuel burning. The rest stays in the atmosphere. Every year, we are adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than natural sinks can remove, and so the total amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere goes up. The bigger the overshoot, the faster atmospheric carbon dioxide increases.\nIn the 1960s, atmospheric carbon dioxide increased by about 0.8 ppm per year on average. That growth rate doubled to an average of 1.6 ppm per year in the 1980s and 1.5 ppm per year in the 1990s. In the last decade (2015-2024), the annual increase has accelerated to 2.6 ppm per year. As a result, the annual rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide over the past 60 years is 100-200 times faster than the increase that occurred at the end of the last ice age 11,000-17,000 years ago.\nCarbon dioxide is Earth\u2019s most important long-lived greenhouse gas: a gas that absorbs and radiates heat. Unlike oxygen or nitrogen (which make up most of Earth's atmosphere), greenhouse gases absorb heat radiating from the Earth\u2019s surface and re-release it in all directions\u2014including back toward Earth\u2019s surface. Without any carbon dioxide, Earth\u2019s natural greenhouse effect would be too weak to keep the average global surface temperature above freezing.\nBy adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, people are amplifying the natural greenhouse effect, causing global temperature to rise. According to observations and analysis by the NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory, carbon dioxide alone is responsible for about 80 percent of the total heating influence of all human-produced greenhouse gases since 1990.\nAnother reason carbon dioxide is important in the Earth system is that it dissolves into the ocean like the fizz in a can of soda. It reacts with water molecules, producing carbonic acid and lowering the ocean's pH (raising its acidity). Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, the pH of the ocean's surface waters has dropped from 8.21 to 8.10. This drop in pH is called ocean acidification, and it interferes with the ability of marine life to extract calcium from sea water to build skeletons and shells.\n(left) A healthy ocean snail has a transparent shell with smoothly contoured ridges.

Two-thirds of the warming has occurred since 1975.\n\nFull Page Content:\nAir temperatures on Earth have been rising since the Industrial Revolution. While natural variability plays some part, the preponderance of evidence indicates that human activities\u2014particularly emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases\u2014are mostly responsible for making our planet warmer.\nAccording to an ongoing temperature analysis led by scientists at NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), the average global temperature on Earth has increased by at least 1.1\u00b0 Celsius (1.9\u00b0 Fahrenheit) since 1880. The majority of the warming has occurred since 1975, at a rate of roughly 0.15 to 0.20\u00b0C per decade.\nThe maps above show temperature anomalies in five-year increments since 1880. (Click on the arrow to run the animation.) These are not absolute temperatures, but changes from the norm for each area. The data reflect how much warmer or cooler each region was compared to a base period of 1951-1980. (The global mean surface air temperature for that period was 14\u00b0C (57\u00b0F), with an uncertainty of several tenths of a degree.)\nThe image below shows global temperature anomalies in 2022, which tied for the fifth warmest year on record. The past nine years have been the warmest years since modern recordkeeping began in 1880.\nAs the maps show, global warming does not mean temperatures rise everywhere at every time by same rate. Temperatures might rise 5 degrees in one region and drop 2 degrees in another. For instance, exceptionally cold winters in one place might be balanced by extremely warm winters in another part of the world. Generally, warming is greater over land than over the oceans because water is slower to absorb and release heat (thermal inertia). Warming may also differ substantially within specific land masses and ocean basins.\nIn the animation at the top of the page and in the bar chart below, the years from 1880 to 1939 tend to be cooler, then level off by the 1950s. Decades within the base period (1951-1980) do not appear particularly warm or cold because they are the standard against which other years are measured.\nThe leveling off of temperatures in the middle of the 20th century can be explained by natural variability and by the cooling effects of aerosols generated by factories, power plants, and motor vehicles in the years of rapid economic growth after World War II. Fossil fuel use also increased after the war (5 percent per year), boosting greenhouse gases. Cooling from aerosol pollution happened rapidly. In contrast, greenhouse gases accumulated slowly, but they remain in the atmosphere for a much longer time. According to former GISS director James Hansen, the strong warming trend of the past four decades likely reflects a shift from balanced aerosol and greenhouse gas effects on the atmosphere to a predominance of greenhouse gas effects after aerosols were curbed by pollution controls.\nWhy should we care about one or two degrees of global warming? After all, temperatures fluctuate by many degrees every day where we live.\nThe temperatures we experience locally and in short periods can fluctuate significantly due to predictable, cyclical events (night and day, summer and winter) and hard-to-predict wind and precipitation patterns. But the global temperature mainly depends on how much energy the planet receives from the Sun and how much it radiates back into space. The energy coming from the Sun fluctuates very little by year, while the amount of energy radiated by Earth is closely tied to the chemical composition of the atmosphere\u2014particularly the amount of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.\nA one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all of the oceans, the atmosphere, and the land masses by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age. A five-degree drop was enough to bury a large part of North America under a towering mass of ice 20,000 years ago.\nGlobal temperature records start around 1880 because observations did not sufficiently cover enough of the planet prior to that time. The line plot above shows yearly temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2020 as recorded by NASA, NOAA, the Berkeley Earth research group, the Met Office Hadley Centre (United Kingdom), and the Cowtan and Way analysis. Though there are minor variations from year to year, all five records show peaks and valleys in sync with each other. All show rapid warming in the past few decades, and all show the last decade as the warmest.\nThe NASA GISS team chose the period of 1951-1980 as its baseline largely because the U.S. National Weather Service uses a three-decade period to define \u201cnormal\u201d or average temperature. The GISS temperature analysis effort also began around 1980, so the most recent 30 years was 1951-1980. Their objective is to provide an estimate of temperature change that could be compared with predictions of global climate change in response to atmospheric carbon dioxide, aerosols, and changes in solar activity.\nNASA\u2019s temperature analyses incorporate surface temperature measurements from more than 20,000 weather stations, ship- and buoy-based observations of sea surface temperatures, and temperature measurements from Antarctic research stations. These in situ measurements are analyzed using an algorithm that considers the varied spacing of temperature stations around the globe and urban heat island effects.\nSubscribe to the Earth Observatory and get the Earth in your inbox.\nNASA's Earth Observatory brings you the Earth, every day, with in-depth stories and stunning imagery.\nExplore Earth Science\nEarth Science Data\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The controversy may be fed by the existence of scientists from other disciplines publicly casting doubt on the validity of climate science. The extent to which non-climate scientists are skeptical of climate science has not been studied via direct survey. Here we report on a survey of biophysical scientists across disciplines at universities in the Big 10 Conference. Most respondents (93.6%) believe that mean temperatures have risen and most (91.9%) believe in an anthropogenic contribution to rising temperatures. Respondents strongly believe that climate science is credible (mean credibility score 6.67/7). Those who disagree about climate change disagree over basic facts (e.g., the effects of CO2 on climate) and have different cultural and political values. These results suggest that scientists who are climate change skeptics are outliers and that the majority of scientists surveyed believe in anthropogenic climate change and that climate science is credible and mature.\nExport citation and abstractBibTeXRIS\nContent from this work may be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licence. Any further distribution of this work must maintain attribution to the author(s) and the title of the work, journal citation and DOI.\nOne vexing and ongoing concern about climate change is the discrepancy between the public view about climate change and the view of climate scientists. Approximately 97% of active, publishing climate scientists believe4 in anthropogenic climate change (Doran and Zimmerman 2009, Anderegg et al 2010) and about 97% of papers published about climate change with an explicit position on the existence of climate change affirm that it is occurring (Cook et al 2013). However, only approximately half of the American public believes in anthropogenic climate change (Leiserowitz et al 2010, Weber and Stern 2011). There are many reasons for public doubt in climate change, including cognitive and affective factors (Gifford 2011, McCright and Dunlap 2011) and media coverage that gives undue weight to the climate change controversy (Boykoff and Boykoff 2004, Boykoff 2007) or is influenced by political ideology (Dotson et al 2012). Scientists who are publicly skeptical about climate science and anthropogenic climate change may also contribute to public disbelief in climate change. These scientists often specialize in disciplines other than climate science and typically are not currently researching climate issues (Jacques et al 2008, Lahsen 2008, Anderegg et al 2010). Concern has been expressed (McCright and Dunlap 2003, Jacques et al 2008) that these scientific skeptics have added false scientific credibility to skepticism. But is it false? Are non-climate scientist skeptics representative of the broader scientific community? What influences scientists\u2019 belief in climate change? Though many scientific organizations have produced climate change position statements affirming the existence of anthropogenic climate change (Oreskes 2004), the drafting of these statements is at times controversial and is often done without directly polling membership (Stenhouse et al 2014). This question is especially significant in the United States, which is the second-largest global emitter of carbon dioxide (Boden et al 2013). Here, we report on a survey of biophysical scientists at universities in the Big 10 Conference, a group of large, research-oriented universities in the United States (see Methods section for more details on the sample). The results show that scientists across disciplines nearly unanimously believe in anthropogenic climate change, are highly certain that climate change is happening, and find climate science to be trustworthy and credible.\nDisagreement about climate change is rarely a simple dispute about facts. Indeed, people\u2019s interpretation of climate change information appears to be influenced by cognitive factors and motivated reasoning (Kellstedt et al 2008, Gifford 2011, Hart and Nisbet 2012, Kahan et al 2012, Carlton and Jacobson 2013, Carlton and Jacobson 2015). Notably, perceptions about risks such as climate change have been shown to be affected by where people fit on two cultural values scales: individualism versus communitarianism and hierarchicalism versus egalitarianism (Kahan et al 2008, Kahan et al 2012). People with more individualistic than communitarian values tend to believe that individuals (as opposed to communities) are responsible for their own well being without help or interference from society. People who hold more hierarchical than egalitarian values tend to believe that authority comes from strict social order based on characteristics such as race, gender, and class. These cultural values influence how people interpret information about risks. According to the cultural cognition hypothesis, hierarchical individualists are more skeptical of environmental risks, including climate change, because accepting these risks would undermine hierarchical individualists\u2019 belief in commerce and industry. Those who hold more egalitarian and communitarian values tend to perceive environmental risks more acutely because they feel that commerce and industry (the drivers of many environmental risks) promote individuals over the community (Kahan et al 2011, Kahan et al 2012). Cultural cognition appears to influence climate change beliefs among everyone, not just those who are uninformed about climate change or who have insufficient reasoning skills to properly evaluate the evidence for anthropogenic climate change. In fact, the effects of cultural cog\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

While natural variability plays some part, the preponderance of evidence indicates that human activities\u2014particularly emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases\u2014are mostly responsible for making our planet warmer.\nAccording to an ongoing temperature analysis led by scientists at NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), the average global temperature on Earth has increased by at least 1.1\u00b0 Celsius (1.9\u00b0 Fahrenheit) since 1880. The majority of the warming has occurred since 1975, at a rate of roughly 0.15 to 0.20\u00b0C per decade.\nThe maps above show temperature anomalies in five-year increments since 1880. (Click on the arrow to run the animation.) These are not absolute temperatures, but changes from the norm for each area. The data reflect how much warmer or cooler each region was compared to a base period of 1951-1980. (The global mean surface air temperature for that period was 14\u00b0C (57\u00b0F), with an uncertainty of several tenths of a degree.)\nThe image below shows global temperature anomalies in 2022, which tied for the fifth warmest year on record. The past nine years have been the warmest years since modern recordkeeping began in 1880.\nAs the maps show, global warming does not mean temperatures rise everywhere at every time by same rate. Temperatures might rise 5 degrees in one region and drop 2 degrees in another. For instance, exceptionally cold winters in one place might be balanced by extremely warm winters in another part of the world. Generally, warming is greater over land than over the oceans because water is slower to absorb and release heat (thermal inertia). Warming may also differ substantially within specific land masses and ocean basins.\nIn the animation at the top of the page and in the bar chart below, the years from 1880 to 1939 tend to be cooler, then level off by the 1950s. Decades within the base period (1951-1980) do not appear particularly warm or cold because they are the standard against which other years are measured.\nThe leveling off of temperatures in the middle of the 20th century can be explained by natural variability and by the cooling effects of aerosols generated by factories, power plants, and motor vehicles in the years of rapid economic growth after World War II. Fossil fuel use also increased after the war (5 percent per year), boosting greenhouse gases. Cooling from aerosol pollution happened rapidly. In contrast, greenhouse gases accumulated slowly, but they remain in the atmosphere for a much longer time. According to former GISS director James Hansen, the strong warming trend of the past four decades likely reflects a shift from balanced aerosol and greenhouse gas effects on the atmosphere to a predominance of greenhouse gas effects after aerosols were curbed by pollution controls.\nWhy should we care about one or two degrees of global warming? After all, temperatures fluctuate by many degrees every day where we live.\nThe temperatures we experience locally and in short periods can fluctuate significantly due to predictable, cyclical events (night and day, summer and winter) and hard-to-predict wind and precipitation patterns. But the global temperature mainly depends on how much energy the planet receives from the Sun and how much it radiates back into space. The energy coming from the Sun fluctuates very little by year, while the amount of energy radiated by Earth is closely tied to the chemical composition of the atmosphere\u2014particularly the amount of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.\nA one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all of the oceans, the atmosphere, and the land masses by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age. A five-degree drop was enough to bury a large part of North America under a towering mass of ice 20,000 years ago.\nGlobal temperature records start around 1880 because observations did not sufficiently cover enough of the planet prior to that time. The line plot above shows yearly temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2020 as recorded by NASA, NOAA, the Berkeley Earth research group, the Met Office Hadley Centre (United Kingdom), and the Cowtan and Way analysis. Though there are minor variations from year to year, all five records show peaks and valleys in sync with each other. All show rapid warming in the past few decades, and all show the last decade as the warmest.\nThe NASA GISS team chose the period of 1951-1980 as its baseline largely because the U.S. National Weather Service uses a three-decade period to define \u201cnormal\u201d or average temperature. The GISS temperature analysis effort also began around 1980, so the most recent 30 years was 1951-1980. Their objective is to provide an estimate of temperature change that could be compared with predictions of global climate change in response to atmospheric carbon dioxide, aerosols, and changes in solar activity.\nNASA\u2019s temperature analyses incorporate surface temperature measurements from more than 20,000 weather stations, ship- and buoy-based observations of sea surface temperatures, and temperature measurements from Antarctic research stations. These in situ measurements are analyzed using an algorithm that considers the varied spacing of temperature stations around the globe and urban heat island effects.\nSubscribe to the Earth Observatory and get the Earth in your inbox.\nNASA's Earth Observatory brings you the Earth, every day, with in-depth stories and stunning imagery.\nExplore Earth Science\nEarth Science Data\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Greenhouse gases trap heat in our atmosphere, causing global warming. Already the average global temperature has increased by 1C, and global temperatures passed the critical 1.5C milestone for the first time in 2024. Warming above 1.5\u00b0C risks further sea level rise, extreme weather, biodiversity loss and species extinction, as well as food scarcity, worsening health and poverty for millions of people worldwide.\nGet updates on our work\nFossil fuels are formed from the decomposition of buried carbon-based organisms that died millions of years ago. They create carbon-rich deposits that are extracted and burned for energy. They are non-renewable and currently supply around 80% of the world\u2019s energy. They are also used to make plastic, steel and a huge range of products. There are three types of fossil fuel \u2013 coal, oil and gas.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has found that emissions from fossil fuels are the dominant cause of global warming. In 2018, 89% of global CO2 emissions came from fossil fuels and industry.\nCoal is a fossil fuel, and is the dirtiest of them all, responsible for over 0.3C of the 1C increase in global average temperatures. This makes it the single largest source of global temperature rise.\nOil releases a huge amount of carbon when burned - approximately a third of the world\u2019s total carbon emissions. There have also been a number of oil spills in recent years that have a devastating impact on our ocean\u2019s ecosystem.\nNatural gas is often promoted as a cleaner energy source than coal and oil. However, natural gas is still a fossil fuel and accounts for a fifth of the world\u2019s total carbon emissions.\nThe IPCC warns that fossil fuel emissions must be halved within 11 years if global warming is to be limited to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\nIn 2015, the world\u2019s governments signed up to the Paris Agreement committing to reduce carbon emissions. However, a recent report by the UN Environment Programme shows that globally, we are on track to produce more than double the amount of coal, oil and gas by 2030 than we can burn if we are to limit global warming by 1.5C. So more needs to be done.\nFossil fuel companies remain huge polluters, producing and selling fossil fuel products while scientists say we need a mass switch to renewable energy and efficiency. In 2019, BP spent millions on an advertising campaign about its low-carbon energy and cleaner natural gas. While its advertising focused on clean energy, in reality, more than 96% of BP\u2019s annual expenditure is still on oil and gas. And it is definitely not just BP \u2013 it\u2019s an industry-wide problem.\nThat\u2019s why, in December of 2019, we lodged a complaint with the UK National Contact Point about BP\u2019s adverts. We also launched a campaign calling for a ban on fossil fuel advertising unless it comes with a tobacco-style health warning. Because the public should know the whole truth about fossil fuels.\nIn February 2020, BP withdrew its advertisements and its CEO Bernard Looney said they would not be replaced under the company\u2019s new policy promising an end to \u2018corporate reputation advertising\u2019.

Content is not being updated or maintained, and some links may no longer work.\nThe modern record of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels began with observations recorded at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. This graph shows the station's monthly average carbon dioxide measurements since 1958 in parts per million (ppm). The seasonal cycle of highs and lows (small peaks and valleys) is driven by Northern Hemisphere summer vegetation growth, which reduces atmospheric carbon dioxide, and winter decay, which increases it. The long-term trend of rising carbon dioxide levels is driven by human activities. At Mauna Loa, the highest monthly value each year occurs in May. In May 2024, carbon dioxide hit just under 427 ppm\u2014a new record. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on Mauna Loa monthly mean data from NOAA Global Monitoring Lab.\nBased on the annual analysis from NOAA\u2019s Global Monitoring Lab, global average atmospheric carbon dioxide was 422.8 parts per million (\u201cppm,\u201d for short) in 2024, a new record high. The increase during 2024 was 3.75 ppm\u2014the largest one-year increase on record. At Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii (graph above), where the modern carbon dioxide record began in 1958, the annual average carbon dioxide in 2024 was 424.61 ppm, also a new record.\nThe years with the largest annual carbon dioxide growth tend to be associated with the strongest El Ni\u00f1os\u2014the warm phase of a natural climate pattern in the tropical Pacific\u2014which lead to high temperatures over land and sea and an expansion of global drought area. In turn, these weather conditions typically lead to less plant growth, which reduces carbon dioxide uptake, as well as increased decomposition of carbon in soil and increased carbon dioxide emissions from forest fires. Together, these impacts cause atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to rise faster than normal.\nEven though the 2023-24 El Ni\u00f1o had waned by April, record high air temperatures and drought in all of 2024, similar to those during an El Nino, were likely drivers of the large increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide in 2024. In addition to other factors, large forest fires in both the Amazon and Canada contributed to the 2024 global increase.\nCarbon dioxide concentrations are rising mostly because of the fossil fuels that people have been burning for energy since the start of the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuels like coal and oil contain the carbon from millions of years of photosynthesis\u2014the process by which plants remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. We are returning that carbon to the atmosphere in just a few hundred years. Since the middle of the 20th century, annual emissions of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels have increased every decade, from close to 11 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year in the 1960s to an estimated 37.4 billion tons in 2024 according to the Global Carbon Budget 2024.\nThe amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (blue line) has increased along with human emissions (gray line) since the start of the Industrial Revolution in 1750. Emissions rose slowly to about 5 gigatons (1 gigaton is 1 billion metric tons per year) in the mid-20th century before rapidly increasing to more than 35 billion tons per year by the end of the century. NOAA Climate.gov graph, adapted from original by Dr. Howard Diamond (NOAA ARL). Atmospheric carbon dioxide data from NOAA and ETHZ. Carbon dioxide emissions data from Our World in Data and the Global Carbon Project.\nCarbon cycle experts estimate that natural \u201csinks,\u201d including plant growth and ocean absorption, remove about half of carbon dioxide humans emit into the atmosphere from fossil fuel burning. The rest stays in the atmosphere. Every year, we are adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than natural sinks can remove, and so the total amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere goes up. The bigger the overshoot, the faster atmospheric carbon dioxide increases.\nIn the 1960s, atmospheric carbon dioxide increased by about 0.8 ppm per year on average. That growth rate doubled to an average of 1.6 ppm per year in the 1980s and 1.5 ppm per year in the 1990s. In the last decade (2015-2024), the annual increase has accelerated to 2.6 ppm per year. As a result, the annual rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide over the past 60 years is 100-200 times faster than the increase that occurred at the end of the last ice age 11,000-17,000 years ago.\nCarbon dioxide is Earth\u2019s most important long-lived greenhouse gas: a gas that absorbs and radiates heat. Unlike oxygen or nitrogen (which make up most of Earth's atmosphere), greenhouse gases absorb heat radiating from the Earth\u2019s surface and re-release it in all directions\u2014including back toward Earth\u2019s surface. Without any carbon dioxide, Earth\u2019s natural greenhouse effect would be too weak to keep the average global surface temperature above freezing.\nBy adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, people are amplifying the natural greenhouse effect, causing global temperature to rise. According to observations and analysis by the NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory, carbon dioxide alone is responsible for about 80 percent of the total heating influence of all human-produced greenhouse gases since 1990.\nAnother reason carbon dioxide is important in the Earth system is that it dissolves into the ocean like the fizz in a can of soda. It reacts with water molecules, producing carbonic acid and lowering the ocean's pH (raising its acidity). Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, the pH of the ocean's surface waters has dropped from 8.21 to 8.10. This drop in pH is called ocean acidification, and it interferes with the ability of marine life to extract calcium from sea water to build skeletons and shells.\n(left) A healthy ocean snail has a transparent shell with smoothly contoured ridges. (right) A shell exposed to more acidic, corrosive waters is cloudy, ragged, and pockmarked wit\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Common characteristics of net-zero energy systems will include: (i) electricity systems that produce no net CO2 or remove CO2 from the atmosphere; (ii) widespread electrification of end uses, including light-duty transport, space heating, and cooking; (iii) substantially lower use of fossil fuels than today; (iv) use of alternative energy carriers such as hydrogen, bioenergy, and ammonia to substitute for fossil fuels in sectors less amenable to electrification; (v) more efficient use of energy than today; (vi) greater energy system integration across regions and across components of the energy system; and (vii) use of CO2 removal (e.g., direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS) and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (DACCS, BECCS)) to offset any residual emissions.

Methane emissions, mainly fugitive emissions from oil, gas, and coal, accounted for 18% of GHG emissions in 2019. Coal electricity capacity grew by 7.6% between 2015 and 2019, as new builds in some countries offset declines in others. Total consumption of oil and oil products increased by 5%, and natural gas consumption grew by 15%. Declining energy intensity in almost all regions has been balanced by increased energy consumption. ( high confidence) {6.3}\nPrices have dropped rapidly over the last five years for several key energy system mitigation options, notably solar photovoltaics (PV), wind power, and batteries. From 2015 to 2020, the prices of electricity from PV and wind dropped 56% and 45%, respectively, and battery prices dropped by 64%. Electricity from PV and wind is now cheaper than electricity from fossil sources in many regions, electric vehicles are increasingly competitive with internal combustion engines, and large-scale battery storage on electricity grids is increasingly viable. ( high confidence) {6.3, 6.4}\nGlobal wind and solar PV capacity and generation have increased rapidly. Solar PV grew by 170% (to 680 TWh); wind grew by 70% (to 1420 TWh) from 2015 to 2019. Policy, societal pressure to limit fossil generation, low interest rates, and cost reductions have all driven wind and solar PV deployment. Solar PV and wind together accounted for 21% of total low-carbon electricity generation and 8% of total electricity generation in 2019. Nuclear generation grew 9% between 2015 and 2019 and accounted for 10% of total generation in 2019 (2790 TWh); hydroelectric power grew by 10% and accounted for 16% (4290 TWh) of total generation.

CCS can allow fossil fuels to be used longer, reducing potential stranded assets.

But the more greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere, the warmer the planet becomes.\n\nFull Page Content:\nLast modification 25.02.2025\nCarbon dioxide (CO\u2082) is a colourless and odourless gas that is a natural component of the air and part of the global carbon cycle. It plays an important role in photosynthesis, in which plants convert CO\u2082 into oxygen. At the same time, CO\u2082 is a significant greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming and climate change. Its concentration is influenced by natural processes and human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels. Monitoring and controlling CO\u2082 emissions are therefore central to environmental protection and climate policy.\nCarbon dioxide (CO\u2082) is an essential component of our atmosphere and is non-toxic, colourless and odourless in gaseous form under natural conditions. The role of CO\u2082 in our climate is crucial: it absorbs some of the heat radiated from the earth and reflects it back to the earth's surface. This natural greenhouse effect regulates the climate on our planet and creates the conditions in which flora and fauna can thrive.\nCO\u2082 is produced as a natural by-product of cellular respiration in numerous living organisms, the decay of dead organisms and the combustion of organic materials such as wood, coal and gas, or even from natural sources of CO\u2082 (e.g. underwater volcanoes and hydrothermal vents). CO\u2082 sinks are essential to close the natural carbon cycle. In nature, CO\u2082 is broken down by plants through photosynthesis or physically dissolved and stored by bodies of water such as seas and oceans.\nCO\u2082 (carbon dioxide) plays a central role in climate change as it is one of the most important greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gases act like a blanket that traps the heat emitted from the earth's surface and retains it in the atmosphere. Without greenhouse gases such as CO\u2082, the Earth would be too cold to support life as we know it. However, the increase in CO\u2082 concentrations in the atmosphere, which is primarily caused by human activities, has significantly intensified this effect.\nSince the beginning of industrialisation (early 19th century), primarily through the burning of coal, oil and natural gas as well as the clearing of forests and draining of wetlands, humans have left behind a considerable carbon footprint. Natural carbon sinks are not sufficient to compensate for anthropogenic CO\u2082 emissions. The increased greenhouse effect due to human activities, also known as the anthropogenic greenhouse effect, is causing the Earth to warm and has a negative impact on our ecosystem. These include a general increase in temperature, the melting of snow and ice, changes in the acidity of water and the extinction of flora and fauna.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Greenhouse gases trap heat in our atmosphere, causing global warming. Already the average global temperature has increased by 1C, and global temperatures passed the critical 1.5C milestone for the first time in 2024. Warming above 1.5\u00b0C risks further sea level rise, extreme weather, biodiversity loss and species extinction, as well as food scarcity, worsening health and poverty for millions of people worldwide.\nGet updates on our work\nFossil fuels are formed from the decomposition of buried carbon-based organisms that died millions of years ago. They create carbon-rich deposits that are extracted and burned for energy. They are non-renewable and currently supply around 80% of the world\u2019s energy. They are also used to make plastic, steel and a huge range of products. There are three types of fossil fuel \u2013 coal, oil and gas.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has found that emissions from fossil fuels are the dominant cause of global warming. In 2018, 89% of global CO2 emissions came from fossil fuels and industry.\nCoal is a fossil fuel, and is the dirtiest of them all, responsible for over 0.3C of the 1C increase in global average temperatures. This makes it the single largest source of global temperature rise.\nOil releases a huge amount of carbon when burned - approximately a third of the world\u2019s total carbon emissions. There have also been a number of oil spills in recent years that have a devastating impact on our ocean\u2019s ecosystem.\nNatural gas is often promoted as a cleaner energy source than coal and oil. However, natural gas is still a fossil fuel and accounts for a fifth of the world\u2019s total carbon emissions.\nThe IPCC warns that fossil fuel emissions must be halved within 11 years if global warming is to be limited to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\nIn 2015, the world\u2019s governments signed up to the Paris Agreement committing to reduce carbon emissions. However, a recent report by the UN Environment Programme shows that globally, we are on track to produce more than double the amount of coal, oil and gas by 2030 than we can burn if we are to limit global warming by 1.5C. So more needs to be done.\nFossil fuel companies remain huge polluters, producing and selling fossil fuel products while scientists say we need a mass switch to renewable energy and efficiency. In 2019, BP spent millions on an advertising campaign about its low-carbon energy and cleaner natural gas. While its advertising focused on clean energy, in reality, more than 96% of BP\u2019s annual expenditure is still on oil and gas. And it is definitely not just BP \u2013 it\u2019s an industry-wide problem.\nThat\u2019s why, in December of 2019, we lodged a complaint with the UK National Contact Point about BP\u2019s adverts. We also launched a campaign calling for a ban on fossil fuel advertising unless it comes with a tobacco-style health warning. Because the public should know the whole truth about fossil fuels.\nIn February 2020, BP withdrew its advertisements and its CEO Bernard Looney said they would not be replaced under the company\u2019s new policy promising an end to \u2018corporate reputation advertising\u2019. He also committed BP to redirecting its advertising resources towards advocating for progressive climate policies.\nUncover the truth behind fossil fuel company greenwashing\n\u00a9 Copyright 2008 - 2025 ClientEarth.

The controversy may be fed by the existence of scientists from other disciplines publicly casting doubt on the validity of climate science. The extent to which non-climate scientists are skeptical of climate science has not been studied via direct survey. Here we report on a survey of biophysical scientists across disciplines at universities in the Big 10 Conference. Most respondents (93.6%) believe that mean temperatures have risen and most (91.9%) believe in an anthropogenic contribution to rising temperatures. Respondents strongly believe that climate science is credible (mean credibility score 6.67/7). Those who disagree about climate change disagree over basic facts (e.g., the effects of CO2 on climate) and have different cultural and political values. These results suggest that scientists who are climate change skeptics are outliers and that the majority of scientists surveyed believe in anthropogenic climate change and that climate science is credible and mature.\nExport citation and abstractBibTeXRIS\nContent from this work may be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licence.

Approximately 97% of active, publishing climate scientists believe4 in anthropogenic climate change (Doran and Zimmerman 2009, Anderegg et al 2010) and about 97% of papers published about climate change with an explicit position on the existence of climate change affirm that it is occurring (Cook et al 2013). However, only approximately half of the American public believes in anthropogenic climate change (Leiserowitz et al 2010, Weber and Stern 2011). There are many reasons for public doubt in climate change, including cognitive and affective factors (Gifford 2011, McCright and Dunlap 2011) and media coverage that gives undue weight to the climate change controversy (Boykoff and Boykoff 2004, Boykoff 2007) or is influenced by political ideology (Dotson et al 2012). Scientists who are publicly skeptical about climate science and anthropogenic climate change may also contribute to public disbelief in climate change. These scientists often specialize in disciplines other than climate science and typically are not currently researching climate issues (Jacques et al 2008, Lahsen 2008, Anderegg et al 2010). Concern has been expressed (McCright and Dunlap 2003, Jacques et al 2008) that these scientific skeptics have added false scientific credibility to skepticism. But is it false? Are non-climate scientist skeptics representative of the broader scientific community? What influences scientists\u2019 belief in climate change? Though many scientific organizations have produced climate change position statements affirming the existence of anthropogenic climate change (Oreskes 2004), the drafting of these statements is at times controversial and is often done without directly polling membership (Stenhouse et al 2014). This question is especially significant in the United States, which is the second-largest global emitter of carbon dioxide (Boden et al 2013). Here, we report on a survey of biophysical scientists at universities in the Big 10 Conference, a group of large, research-oriented universities in the United States (see Methods section for more details on the sample). The results show that scientists across disciplines nearly unanimously believe in anthropogenic climate change, are highly certain that climate change is happening, and find climate science to be trustworthy and credible.\nDisagreement about climate change is rarely a simple dispute about facts. Indeed, people\u2019s interpretation of climate change information appears to be influenced by cognitive factors and motivated reasoning (Kellstedt et al 2008, Gifford 2011, Hart and Nisbet 2012, Kahan et al 2012, Carlton and Jacobson 2013, Carlton and Jacobson 2015). Notably, perceptions about risks such as climate change have been shown to be affected by where people fit on two cultural values scales: individualism versus communitarianism and hierarchicalism versus egalitarianism (Kahan et al 2008, Kahan et al 2012). People with more individualistic than communitarian values tend to believe that individuals (as opposed to communities) are responsible for their own well being without help or interference from society. People who hold more hierarchical than egalitarian values tend to believe that authority comes from strict social order based on characteristics such as race, gender, and class. These cultural values influence how people interpret information about risks. According to the cultural cognition hypothesis, hierarchical individualists are more skeptical of environmental risks, including climate change, because accepting these risks would undermine hierarchical individualists\u2019 belief in commerce and industry. Those who hold more egalitarian and communitarian values tend to perceive environmental risks more acutely because they feel that commerce and industry (the drivers of many environmental risks) promote individuals over the community (Kahan et al 2011, Kahan et al 2012). Cultural cognition appears to influence climate change beliefs among everyone, not just those who are uninformed about climate change or who have insufficient reasoning skills to properly evaluate the evidence for anthropogenic climate change.

The controversy may be fed by the existence of scientists from other disciplines publicly casting doubt on the validity of climate science. The extent to which non-climate scientists are skeptical of climate science has not been studied via direct survey. Here we report on a survey of biophysical scientists across disciplines at universities in the Big 10 Conference. Most respondents (93.6%) believe that mean temperatures have risen and most (91.9%) believe in an anthropogenic contribution to rising temperatures. Respondents strongly believe that climate science is credible (mean credibility score 6.67/7). Those who disagree about climate change disagree over basic facts (e.g., the effects of CO2 on climate) and have different cultural and political values. These results suggest that scientists who are climate change skeptics are outliers and that the majority of scientists surveyed believe in anthropogenic climate change and that climate science is credible and mature.\nExport citation and abstractBibTeXRIS\nContent from this work may be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licence.

If we want to reduce these emissions, we need to transform our energy systems, industries, and food systems.\nAt the same time, we need to tackle energy poverty, low standards of living, and poor nutrition, which all remain enormous problems for billions of people.\nTechnological advances could allow us to do both. The prices of solar, wind, and batteries have plummeted in recent decades, increasingly undercutting the cost of fossil fuel alternatives. Further progress could allow us to provide cheap, clean energy for everyone. Political change is essential to create a system that supports rapid decarbonization.\nEmissions are still rising in many parts of the world. However, several countries have managed to cut their emissions in recent decades. With affordable low-carbon technologies, other countries can increase their living standards without the high-carbon pathway that rich countries followed in the past.\nOn this page, you can find our data, visualizations, and writing on CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions.\nHuman emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are the primary drivers of the global rise in temperatures.1 This link between global temperatures and greenhouse gas concentrations \u2013 especially CO2 \u2013 has been true throughout Earth\u2019s history.2\nIn the chart, we see the global average temperature relative to a baseline, which is the average between 1861 and 1890. This gives us an estimate of the temperature increase compared to \u201cpre-industrial\u201d times. Average global temperatures have risen by approximately 1.3\u00b0C since then (with even higher anomalies in the last few years).\nThis warming has not been equally distributed across the world. The Northern Hemisphere has warmed more than the Southern Hemisphere. In some regions, temperatures have risen by more than 5\u00b0C. You can see this distribution in maps published by Berkeley Earth.\nHuman emissions have been the main driver of this change. Aerosols have played a slight cooling role in global climate, and natural variability has played a minor role. This article from Carbon Brief explains this very well, with interactive graphics showing the relative contributions of different factors to the climate.\nSeptember 27, 2023\nThere are many ways to measure countries\u2019 contributions to climate change. What do they tell us?\nHannah Ritchie, Pablo Rosado, and Max Roser\nDecember 01, 2021\nIt is possible to reduce emissions while growing the economy. But this decoupling needs to happen faster.\nHannah Ritchie\nSeptember 29, 2023\nThe budget to keep temperatures below 1.5\u00b0C is less than a decade of current emissions. For 2\u00b0C, it\u2019s less than three decades.\nHannah Ritchie\nJune 23, 2020\nHannah Ritchie, Pablo Rosado, and Max Roser\nJune 10, 2020\nHannah Ritchie, Pablo Rosado, and Max Roser\nJune 10, 2020\nHannah Ritchie, Pablo Rosado, and Max Roser\nHannah Ritchie, Pablo Rosado, and Max Roser\nNovember 03, 2021\nMax Roser\nDecember 10, 2020\nMax Roser\nFebruary 10, 2020\nHannah Ritchie\nDecember 01, 2020\nMax Roser\nOctober 06, 2020\nHannah Ritchie\nAugust 30, 2023\nHannah Ritchie\nNovember 09, 2020\nHannah Ritchie\nApril 08, 2024\nHannah Ritchie\nJune 10, 2021\nHannah Ritchie\nNovember 06, 2019\nHannah Ritchie\nMarch 18, 2020\nHannah Ritchie\nMarch 18, 2021\nHannah Ritchie\nFebruary 04, 2020\nHannah Ritchie\nJanuary 24, 2020\nHannah Ritchie\nJune 01, 2021\nMax Roser\nOctober 14, 2022\nHannah Ritchie and Pablo Rosado\nSeptember 18, 2020\nHannah Ritchie\nOctober 07, 2019\nHannah Ritchie\nAugust 31, 2023\nHannah Ritchie\nIPCC, 2021: Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis.

Greenhouse gases trap heat in our atmosphere, causing global warming. Already the average global temperature has increased by 1C, and global temperatures passed the critical 1.5C milestone for the first time in 2024. Warming above 1.5\u00b0C risks further sea level rise, extreme weather, biodiversity loss and species extinction, as well as food scarcity, worsening health and poverty for millions of people worldwide.\nGet updates on our work\nFossil fuels are formed from the decomposition of buried carbon-based organisms that died millions of years ago. They create carbon-rich deposits that are extracted and burned for energy. They are non-renewable and currently supply around 80% of the world\u2019s energy. They are also used to make plastic, steel and a huge range of products. There are three types of fossil fuel \u2013 coal, oil and gas.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has found that emissions from fossil fuels are the dominant cause of global warming. In 2018, 89% of global CO2 emissions came from fossil fuels and industry.\nCoal is a fossil fuel, and is the dirtiest of them all, responsible for over 0.3C of the 1C increase in global average temperatures. This makes it the single largest source of global temperature rise.\nOil releases a huge amount of carbon when burned - approximately a third of the world\u2019s total carbon emissions. There have also been a number of oil spills in recent years that have a devastating impact on our ocean\u2019s ecosystem.\nNatural gas is often promoted as a cleaner energy source than coal and oil. However, natural gas is still a fossil fuel and accounts for a fifth of the world\u2019s total carbon emissions.\nThe IPCC warns that fossil fuel emissions must be halved within 11 years if global warming is to be limited to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\nIn 2015, the world\u2019s governments signed up to the Paris Agreement committing to reduce carbon emissions. However, a recent report by the UN Environment Programme shows that globally, we are on track to produce more than double the amount of coal, oil and gas by 2030 than we can burn if we are to limit global warming by 1.5C. So more needs to be done.\nFossil fuel companies remain huge polluters, producing and selling fossil fuel products while scientists say we need a mass switch to renewable energy and efficiency. In 2019, BP spent millions on an advertising campaign about its low-carbon energy and cleaner natural gas. While its advertising focused on clean energy, in reality, more than 96% of BP\u2019s annual expenditure is still on oil and gas. And it is definitely not just BP \u2013 it\u2019s an industry-wide problem.\nThat\u2019s why, in December of 2019, we lodged a complaint with the UK National Contact Point about BP\u2019s adverts. We also launched a campaign calling for a ban on fossil fuel advertising unless it comes with a tobacco-style health warning. Because the public should know the whole truth about fossil fuels.\nIn February 2020, BP withdrew its advertisements and its CEO Bernard Looney said they would not be replaced under the company\u2019s new policy promising an end to \u2018corporate reputation advertising\u2019. He also committed BP to redirecting its advertising resources towards advocating for progressive climate policies.\nUncover the truth behind fossil fuel company greenwashing\n\u00a9 Copyright 2008 - 2025 ClientEarth.

However, a recent report by the UN Environment Programme shows that globally, we are on track to produce more than double the amount of coal, oil and gas by 2030 than we can burn if we are to limit global warming by 1.5C. So more needs to be done.\nFossil fuel companies remain huge polluters, producing and selling fossil fuel products while scientists say we need a mass switch to renewable energy and efficiency. In 2019, BP spent millions on an advertising campaign about its low-carbon energy and cleaner natural gas. While its advertising focused on clean energy, in reality, more than 96% of BP\u2019s annual expenditure is still on oil and gas. And it is definitely not just BP \u2013 it\u2019s an industry-wide problem.\nThat\u2019s why, in December of 2019, we lodged a complaint with the UK National Contact Point about BP\u2019s adverts. We also launched a campaign calling for a ban on fossil fuel advertising unless it comes with a tobacco-style health warning. Because the public should know the whole truth about fossil fuels.\nIn February 2020, BP withdrew its advertisements and its CEO Bernard Looney said they would not be replaced under the company\u2019s new policy promising an end to \u2018corporate reputation advertising\u2019. He also committed BP to redirecting its advertising resources towards advocating for progressive climate policies.\nUncover the truth behind fossil fuel company greenwashing\n\u00a9 Copyright 2008 - 2025 ClientEarth.

From 2015 to 2020, the prices of electricity from PV and wind dropped 56% and 45%, respectively, and battery prices dropped by 64%. Electricity from PV and wind is now cheaper than electricity from fossil sources in many regions, electric vehicles are increasingly competitive with internal combustion engines, and large-scale battery storage on electricity grids is increasingly viable.

Policy, societal pressure to limit fossil generation, low interest rates, and cost reductions have all driven wind and solar PV deployment. Solar PV and wind together accounted for 21% of total low-carbon electricity generation and 8% of total electricity generation in 2019. Nuclear generation grew 9% between 2015 and 2019 and accounted for 10% of total generation in 2019 (2790 TWh); hydroelectric power grew by 10% and accounted for 16% (4290 TWh) of total generation.

( high confidence) {6.3, 6.4}\nGlobal wind and solar PV capacity and generation have increased rapidly. Solar PV grew by 170% (to 680 TWh); wind grew by 70% (to 1420 TWh) from 2015 to 2019. Policy, societal pressure to limit fossil generation, low interest rates, and cost reductions have all driven wind and solar PV deployment. Solar PV and wind together accounted for 21% of total low-carbon electricity generation and 8% of total electricity generation in 2019. Nuclear generation grew 9% between 2015 and 2019 and accounted for 10% of total generation in 2019 (2790 TWh); hydroelectric power grew by 10% and accounted for 16% (4290 TWh) of total generation. In total,low- and zero-carbon electricity generation technologies produced 37% of global electricity in 2019. ( high confidence) {6.3, 6.4}\nIf investments in coal and other fossil infrastructure continue, energy systems will be locked in to higher emissions, making it harder to limit warming to well below 2\u00b0C. Many aspects of the energy system \u2013 physical infrastructure; institutions, laws, and regulations; and behaviour \u2013 are resistant to change or take many years to change. New investments in coal-fired electricity without CCS are inconsistent with limiting warming to well below 2\u00b0C. ( high confidence) {6.3, 6.7}\nLimiting warming to well below 2\u00b0C will strand fossil-related assets, including fossil infrastructure and unburned fossil fuel resources. The economic impact of stranded assets could amount to trillions of dollars. Coal assets are most vulnerable over the coming decade; oil and gas assets are more vulnerable toward mid-century. CCS can allow fossil fuels to be used longer, reducing potential stranded assets. ( high confidence) {6.7}\nA low-carbon energy transition will shift investment patterns and create new economic opportunities. Total energy investment needs will rise, relative to today, over the next decades, if warming is limited to 2\u00b0C (>67%) or lower. These increases will be far less pronounced, however, than the reallocations of investment flows that are likely to be seen across sub-sectors, namely from fossil fuels (extraction, conversion, and electricity generation) without CCS and toward renewables, n\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The controversy may be fed by the existence of scientists from other disciplines publicly casting doubt on the validity of climate science. The extent to which non-climate scientists are skeptical of climate science has not been studied via direct survey. Here we report on a survey of biophysical scientists across disciplines at universities in the Big 10 Conference. Most respondents (93.6%) believe that mean temperatures have risen and most (91.9%) believe in an anthropogenic contribution to rising temperatures. Respondents strongly believe that climate science is credible (mean credibility score 6.67/7). Those who disagree about climate change disagree over basic facts (e.g., the effects of CO2 on climate) and have different cultural and political values. These results suggest that scientists who are climate change skeptics are outliers and that the majority of scientists surveyed believe in anthropogenic climate change and that climate science is credible and mature.\nExport citation and abstractBibTeXRIS\nContent from this work may be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licence. Any further distribution of this work must maintain attribution to the author(s) and the title of the work, journal citation and DOI.\nOne vexing and ongoing concern about climate change is the discrepancy between the public view about climate change and the view of climate scientists. Approximately 97% of active, publishing climate scientists believe4 in anthropogenic climate change (Doran and Zimmerman 2009, Anderegg et al 2010) and about 97% of papers published about climate change with an explicit position on the existence of climate change affirm that it is occurring (Cook et al 2013). However, only approximately half of the American public believes in anthropogenic climate change (Leiserowitz et al 2010, Weber and Stern 2011). There are many reasons for public doubt in climate change, including cognitive and affective factors (Gifford 2011, McCright and Dunlap 2011) and media coverage that gives undue weight to the climate change controversy (Boykoff and Boykoff 2004, Boykoff 2007) or is influenced by political ideology (Dotson et al 2012). Scientists who are publicly skeptical about climate science and anthropogenic climate change may also contribute to public disbelief in climate change. These scientists often specialize in disciplines other than climate science and typically are not currently researching climate issues (Jacques et al 2008, Lahsen 2008, Anderegg et al 2010). Concern has been expressed (McCright and Dunlap 2003, Jacques et al 2008) that these scientific skeptics have added false scientific credibility to skepticism. But is it false? Are non-climate scientist skeptics representative of the broader scientific community? What influences scientists\u2019 belief in climate change? Though many scientific organizations have produced climate change position statements affirming the existence of anthropogenic climate change (Oreskes 2004), the drafting of these statements is at times controversial and is often done without directly polling membership (Stenhouse et al 2014). This question is especially significant in the United States, which is the second-largest global emitter of carbon dioxide (Boden et al 2013). Here, we report on a survey of biophysical scientists at universities in the Big 10 Conference, a group of large, research-oriented universities in the United States (see Methods section for more details on the sample). The results show that scientists across disciplines nearly unanimously believe in anthropogenic climate change, are highly certain that climate change is happening, and find climate science to be trustworthy and credible.\nDisagreement about climate change is rarely a simple dispute about facts. Indeed, people\u2019s interpretation of climate change information appears to be influenced by cognitive factors and motivated reasoning (Kellstedt et al 2008, Gifford 2011, Hart and Nisbet 2012, Kahan et al 2012, Carlton and Jacobson 2013, Carlton and Jacobson 2015). Notably, perceptions about risks such as climate change have been shown to be affected by where people fit on two cultural values scales: individualism versus communitarianism and hierarchicalism versus egalitarianism (Kahan et al 2008, Kahan et al 2012). People with more individualistic than communitarian values tend to believe that individuals (as opposed to communities) are responsible for their own well being without help or interference from society. People who hold more hierarchical than egalitarian values tend to believe that authority comes from strict social order based on characteristics such as race, gender, and class. These cultural values influence how people interpret information about risks. According to the cultural cognition hypothesis, hierarchical individualists are more skeptical of environmental risks, including climate change, because accepting these risks would undermine hierarchical individualists\u2019 belief in commerce and industry. Those who hold more egalitarian and communitarian values tend to perceive environmental risks more acutely because they feel that commerce and industry (the drivers of many environmental risks) promote individuals over the community (Kahan et al 2011, Kahan et al 2012). Cultural cognition appears to influence climate change beliefs among everyone, not just those who are uninformed about climate change or who have insufficient reasoning skills to properly evaluate the evidence for anthropogenic climate change. In fact, the effects of cultural cog\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Two-thirds of the warming has occurred since 1975.\n\nFull Page Content:\nDifferent types of environmental evidence are used to understand what the Earth\u2019s past climate was like and why. Records of historical climate conditions are preserved in tree rings, locked in the skeletons of tropical coral reefs, sealed in glaciers and ice caps, and buried in laminated sediments from lakes and the ocean.\nScientists can use those environmental recorders to estimate past conditions, extending our understanding of climate back hundreds to millions of years.\nGlobal-scale observations from the instrumental era began in the mid-19th century, and paleoclimate reconstructions extend the record of some quantities back hundreds to millions of years. Together, this provides a comprehensive view of the variability and long-term changes in the atmosphere, the ocean, the cryosphere and at the land surface.\nThe Earth\u2019s climate is changing, and it is projected to continue changing over the next century.\nThe magnitude of climate change beyond the next few decades will depend primarily on the amount of greenhouse (heat-trapping) gases emitted globally and on the remaining uncertainty about the Earth\u2019s climate's sensitivity to those emissions.\nWith significant reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the global annual average temperature rise could be limited to 2\u00b0C or less. However, without major reductions in these emissions, the increase in annual average global temperatures relative to preindustrial times could reach 5\u00b0C or more by the end of this century.\nThe global climate continues to change rapidly compared to the pace of natural climate variations throughout Earth\u2019s history. Trends in globally averaged temperature, sea level rise, upper-ocean heat content, land-based ice melt, arctic sea ice, depth of seasonal permafrost thaw, and other climate variables provide consistent evidence of a warming planet.\nThese observed trends are robust and confirmed by multiple independent research groups worldwide. Figure 1 shows global average temperature anomalies; since the 1880s, the global average temperature has warmed approximately 1\u00b0C.\nFIGURE 2\nThe period from 1983 to 2012 was likely the warmest 30-year period of the last 800 years and likely the warmest 30-year period of the previous 1400 years.\nFigure 4a shows the radiative forcing (W/m2) due to volcanic, solar, and well-mixed greenhouse gases (WMGHGs). Different colors illustrate the two existing data sets for volcanic forcing and four estimates of solar forcing and the grey line represents WMGHGs for the period from 850 to 2000.\nFigure 4b represents the simulated (red) and reconstructed (gray) Northern Hemisphere temperature anomalies for the period from 850 to 2000. The thick red line depicts the multi-model mean while the thin red lines show the multi-model 90% range. The overlap of reconstructed temperatures is shown by grey shading.\nIn Figure 3, model projections indicate that twenty-first-century global average warming will substantially exceed the Last Glacial Maximum period and even the warmest Holocene conditions, producing a climate state not previously experienced.\nFIGURE 3\nThe period from 1983 to 2012 was likely the warmest 30-year period of the last 800 years and likely the warmest 30-year period of the previous 1400 years.\nModel-simulated global temperature anomalies for the Last Glacial Maximum (21,000 years ago), the mid-Holocene (6,000 years ago), and projection for 2071\u20132095, under RCP8.5.\nEarth\u2019s climate is now changing faster than at any point in the known history of the climate, primarily as a result of human activities.\nThere is scientific consensus that unmitigated carbon emissions will lead to global warming of at least several degrees Celsius by 2100, resulting in high-impacts of local, regional and global risks to human society and natural ecosystems. Global climate change has already resulted in a wide range of impacts across every region of the earth as well as many economic sectors.\nImpacts related to climate change are evident across regions and in many sectors important to society, such as human health, agriculture and food security, water supply, transportation, energy, and biodiversity and ecosystems; impacts are expected to become increasingly disruptive in the coming decades.\nThere is very high confidence that the frequency and intensity of extreme heat and heavy precipitation events are increasing in most continental regions of the world. These trends are consistent with expected physical responses to a warming climate. The frequency and intensity of extreme high temperature events are virtually certain to increase in the future as global temperature increases.\nThere is high confidence that extreme precipitation events will very likely continue to increase in frequency and intensity throughout most of the world. Observed and projected trends for other types of extreme events, such as floods, droughts, and severe storms, have more variable regional characteristics.\nObserved changes over the 20th century include increases in global air and ocean temperature, rising global sea levels, long-term sustained widespread reduction of snow and ice cover, and changes in atmospheric and ocean circulation as well as regional weather patterns, which influence seasonal rainfall conditions.\nThese changes are caused by extra heat in the climate system due to the addition of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. These additional greenhouse gases are primarily input by human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), deforestation, agriculture, and land-use changes. These activities increase the amount of \u2018heat-trapping\u2019 greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\nThe pattern of observed changes in the climate system is consistent with an increased greenhouse effect. Other climatic influences such as volcanoes, the sun and natural variability cannot alone explain the timing and extent of the observed changes.\nClimate, refers to the long-term regional or global average of temperature, humid\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The controversy may be fed by the existence of scientists from other disciplines publicly casting doubt on the validity of climate science. The extent to which non-climate scientists are skeptical of climate science has not been studied via direct survey. Here we report on a survey of biophysical scientists across disciplines at universities in the Big 10 Conference. Most respondents (93.6%) believe that mean temperatures have risen and most (91.9%) believe in an anthropogenic contribution to rising temperatures. Respondents strongly believe that climate science is credible (mean credibility score 6.67/7). Those who disagree about climate change disagree over basic facts (e.g., the effects of CO2 on climate) and have different cultural and political values. These results suggest that scientists who are climate change skeptics are outliers and that the majority of scientists surveyed believe in anthropogenic climate change and that climate science is credible and mature.\nExport citation and abstractBibTeXRIS\nContent from this work may be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licence.

Approximately 97% of active, publishing climate scientists believe4 in anthropogenic climate change (Doran and Zimmerman 2009, Anderegg et al 2010) and about 97% of papers published about climate change with an explicit position on the existence of climate change affirm that it is occurring (Cook et al 2013). However, only approximately half of the American public believes in anthropogenic climate change (Leiserowitz et al 2010, Weber and Stern 2011). There are many reasons for public doubt in climate change, including cognitive and affective factors (Gifford 2011, McCright and Dunlap 2011) and media coverage that gives undue weight to the climate change controversy (Boykoff and Boykoff 2004, Boykoff 2007) or is influenced by political ideology (Dotson et al 2012). Scientists who are publicly skeptical about climate science and anthropogenic climate change may also contribute to public disbelief in climate change. These scientists often specialize in disciplines other than climate science and typically are not currently researching climate issues (Jacques et al 2008, Lahsen 2008, Anderegg et al 2010). Concern has been expressed (McCright and Dunlap 2003, Jacques et al 2008) that these scientific skeptics have added false scientific credibility to skepticism. But is it false? Are non-climate scientist skeptics representative of the broader scientific community? What influences scientists\u2019 belief in climate change? Though many scientific organizations have produced climate change position statements affirming the existence of anthropogenic climate change (Oreskes 2004), the drafting of these statements is at times controversial and is often done without directly polling membership (Stenhouse et al 2014). This question is especially significant in the United States, which is the second-largest global emitter of carbon dioxide (Boden et al 2013). Here, we report on a survey of biophysical scientists at universities in the Big 10 Conference, a group of large, research-oriented universities in the United States (see Methods section for more details on the sample). The results show that scientists across disciplines nearly unanimously believe in anthropogenic climate change, are highly certain that climate change is happening, and find climate science to be trustworthy and credible.\nDisagreement about climate change is rarely a simple dispute about facts. Indeed, people\u2019s interpretation of climate change information appears to be influenced by cognitive factors and motivated reasoning (Kellstedt et al 2008, Gifford 2011, Hart and Nisbet 2012, Kahan et al 2012, Carlton and Jacobson 2013, Carlton and Jacobson 2015). Notably, perceptions about risks such as climate change have been shown to be affected by where people fit on two cultural values scales: individualism versus communitarianism and hierarchicalism versus egalitarianism (Kahan et al 2008, Kahan et al 2012). People with more individualistic than communitarian values tend to believe that individuals (as opposed to communities) are responsible for their own well being without help or interference from society. People who hold more hierarchical than egalitarian values tend to believe that authority comes from strict social order based on characteristics such as race, gender, and class. These cultural values influence how people interpret information about risks. According to the cultural cognition hypothesis, hierarchical individualists are more skeptical of environmental risks, including climate change, because accepting these risks would undermine hierarchical individualists\u2019 belief in commerce and industry. Those who hold more egalitarian and communitarian values tend to perceive environmental risks more acutely because they feel that commerce and industry (the drivers of many environmental risks) promote individuals over the community (Kahan et al 2011, Kahan et al 2012). Cultural cognition appears to influence climate change beliefs among everyone, not just those who are uninformed about climate change or who have insufficient reasoning skills to properly evaluate the evidence for anthropogenic climate change. In fact, the effects of cultural cog\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas contributing ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nThis website is an ARCHIVED version of NOAA Climate.gov as of June 25, 2025. Content is not being updated or maintained, and some links may no longer work.\nThe modern record of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels began with observations recorded at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. This graph shows the station's monthly average carbon dioxide measurements since 1958 in parts per million (ppm). The seasonal cycle of highs and lows (small peaks and valleys) is driven by Northern Hemisphere summer vegetation growth, which reduces atmospheric carbon dioxide, and winter decay, which increases it. The long-term trend of rising carbon dioxide levels is driven by human activities. At Mauna Loa, the highest monthly value each year occurs in May. In May 2024, carbon dioxide hit just under 427 ppm\u2014a new record. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on Mauna Loa monthly mean data from NOAA Global Monitoring Lab.\nBased on the annual analysis from NOAA\u2019s Global Monitoring Lab, global average atmospheric carbon dioxide was 422.8 parts per million (\u201cppm,\u201d for short) in 2024, a new record high. The increase during 2024 was 3.75 ppm\u2014the largest one-year increase on record. At Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii (graph above), where the modern carbon dioxide record began in 1958, the annual average carbon dioxide in 2024 was 424.61 ppm, also a new record.\nThe years with the largest annual carbon dioxide growth tend to be associated with the strongest El Ni\u00f1os\u2014the warm phase of a natural climate pattern in the tropical Pacific\u2014which lead to high temperatures over land and sea and an expansion of global drought area. In turn, these weather conditions typically lead to less plant growth, which reduces carbon dioxide uptake, as well as increased decomposition of carbon in soil and increased carbon dioxide emissions from forest fires. Together, these impacts cause atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to rise faster than normal.\nEven though the 2023-24 El Ni\u00f1o had waned by April, record high air temperatures and drought in all of 2024, similar to those during an El Nino, were likely drivers of the large increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide in 2024. In addition to other factors, large forest fires in both the Amazon and Canada contributed to the 2024 global increase.\nCarbon dioxide concentrations are rising mostly because of the fossil fuels that people have been burning for energy since the start of the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuels like coal and oil contain the carbon from millions of years of photosynthesis\u2014the process by which plants remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. We are returning that carbon to the atmosphere in just a few hundred years. Since the middle of the 20th century, annual emissions of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels have increased every decade, from close to 11 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year in the 1960s to an estimated 37.4 billion tons in 2024 according to the Global Carbon Budget 2024.\nThe amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (blue line) has increased along with human emissions (gray line) since the start of the Industrial Revolution in 1750. Emissions rose slowly to about 5 gigatons (1 gigaton is 1 billion metric tons per year) in the mid-20th century before rapidly increasing to more than 35 billion tons per year by the end of the century. NOAA Climate.gov graph, adapted from original by Dr. Howard Diamond (NOAA ARL). Atmospheric carbon dioxide data from NOAA and ETHZ. Carbon dioxide emissions data from Our World in Data and the Global Carbon Project.\nCarbon cycle experts estimate that natural \u201csinks,\u201d including plant growth and ocean absorption, remove about half of carbon dioxide humans emit into the atmosphere from fossil fuel burning. The rest stays in the atmosphere. Every year, we are adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than natural sinks can remove, and so the total amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere goes up. The bigger the overshoot, the faster atmospheric carbon dioxide increases.\nIn the 1960s, atmospheric carbon dioxide increased by about 0.8 ppm per year on average. That growth rate doubled to an average of 1.6 ppm per year in the 1980s and 1.5 ppm per year in the 1990s. In the last decade (2015-2024), the annual increase has accelerated to 2.6 ppm per year. As a result, the annual rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide over the past 60 years is 100-200 times faster than the increase that occurred at the end of the last ice age 11,000-17,000 years ago.\nCarbon dioxide is Earth\u2019s most important long-lived greenhouse gas: a gas that absorbs and radiates heat. Unlike oxygen or nitrogen (which make up most of Earth's atmosphere), greenhouse gases absorb heat radiating from the Earth\u2019s surface and re-release it in all directions\u2014including back toward Earth\u2019s surface. Without any carbon dioxide, Earth\u2019s natural greenhouse effect would be too weak to keep the average global surface temperature above freezing.\nBy adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, people are amplifying the natural greenhouse effect, causing global temperature to rise. According to observations and analysis by the NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory, carbon dioxide alone is responsible for about 80 percent of the total heating influence of all human-produced greenhouse gases since 1990.\nAnother reason carbon dioxide is important in the Earth system is that it dissolves into the ocean like the fizz in a can of soda. It reacts with water molecules, producing carbonic acid and lowering the ocean's pH (raising its acidity). Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, the pH of the ocean's surface waters has dropped from 8.21 to 8.10. This drop in pH is called ocean acidification, and it interferes with the ability of marine life to extract calcium from sea water to build skeletons and shells.\n(left) A healthy ocean snail has a transparent shell with smoothly contoured ridges.

One of the clearest signs is that the world is warming. Scientists know this through evidence compiled from satellites, weather balloons, thermometers, weather stations and more.1 Since 1880, average global temperatures have increased by about 1 degrees Celsius (1.7\u00b0 degrees Fahrenheit). Global temperature is projected to warm by about 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7\u00b0 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2050 and 2-4 degrees Celsius (3.6-7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100.2\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) [exit DNR], average annual global temperatures have increased steadily since the 1960s. Figure 1 shows deviations from the average global temperature depicted as the horizontal line at 0.00 degrees Celsius. Every blue bar is a year that was colder than the average temperature of the 20th century. Red bars are years that were warmer than the 20th century average. Nineteen of the 20 warmest years have occurred since 2001. It is likely that the coldest year moving forward will be warmer than the warmest year that we experienced in the 20th century.\nTo determine changes in Wisconsin temperature and precipitation, scientists from the University of Wisconsin-Madison analyzed temperature records from a statewide network compiled by the National Climatic Data Center. This dataset shows that Wisconsin has become 2 degrees Fahrenheit warmer and 4.5 inches (14 percent) wetter since the 1950s, with the greatest warming during winter and the largest precipitation increase during summer (Figure 2).\nRecordings of daily atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), initiated by Dr. Charles David Keeling of the Scripps Institute of Oceanography, help to tell the story of increasing CO2 levels. Keeling was curious whether the increasing amounts of fossil fuel being combusted would affect atmospheric CO2 levels. So, in 1958 he began to record daily atmospheric CO2 levels at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. Mauna Loa was selected as a long-term monitoring site because it was far from other continents and vegetation that could affect the CO2 concentration. The daily recordings are considered one of the world\u2019s greatest scientific contributions.\nKeeling's measurements discovered an annual planetary cycle in CO2 , in which CO2 levels rise and fall seasonally (Figure 3). This cycle is tied to photosynthesis. In the spring as plants grow, they take carbon dioxide from the air and using the energy from sunlight, convert it into carbon and release oxygen. In the fall as plants die, they release CO2 and global CO2 readings rise.\nIn addition to the seasonal cycling, Keeling also recorded an increase in CO2 concentration over time, from 313 parts per million (ppm) in 1958 to 415 ppm as of March 30, 2020. This rise in CO2 concentration, known as the Keeling Curve has transformed the way scientists understand the source of CO2\nScientists understand the source of CO2 in the atmosphere from several lines of evidence, including measurements of Antarctic ice cores that go back 800,000 years. Antarctic ice cores contain our atmosphere\u2019s history in bubbles of air that were trapped hundreds of thousands of years ago when the ice was first formed. Scientists can analyze these bubbles to determine how CO2 levels have changed over time.3 The cores show that for the last 800,000 years, until about 1900, CO2 levels were relatively stable, fluctuating between about 150 and 280 ppm. In the early 1900s, CO2 started to increase at an unprecedented rate. Today, only 120 years later, CO2 levels are 40 percent higher than they were before the industrial revolution (Figure 4).\nCO2 emissions make up the vast majority of greenhouse gases (GHG) that warm the planet. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources Air Management Program has prepared the Wisconsin Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory (1990-2021) [PDF], identifying CO2 and other GHG emissions in Wisconsin for 2005 and 2021, and describing emission trends from 1990 through 2021. Report authors used the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s State Inventory Tool populated with default data.\nResearch conducted by the Wisconsin Initiative on Climate Change Impacts (WICCI) [exit DNR], a collaboration of more than 200 scientists and practitioners, provides useful information on the impacts of climate changes, adaptive strategies and solutions to both store carbon and reduce carbon emissions. The University of Wisconsin-Madison's Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources lead WICCI.\nWICCI climate scientists have been able to project local temperature and precipitation patterns for Wisconsin. The scientists took taking global climate models that simulate climate changes on a large scale (typically 100-200 miles) and downscaled them to approximately six miles. The downscaled models have allowed scientists to forecast more realistic, localized temperature and precipitation changes, and changes in extreme weather events. WICCI scientists are continuing to work with people around the state to fine-tune these models and provide forecasts for other climate factors that are important to impacts in Wisconsin.\nWisconsin is likely to become a much warmer state over the next few decades, with average temperatures closer to southern Illinois or Missouri. Results show that Wisconsin has warmed 2 to 3 degrees Fahrenheit since 1950, and it is projected that the state will warm an additional 2 to 8 degrees by 2050 (Figure 5). We will also likely see a tripling in the frequency of extreme heat (days above 90 degrees Fahrenheit), rising from about 10 days per year in 2020 to about 30 days per year by 2050 (Figure 6).\nSeasonal temperatures have also changed. Spring temperatures have increased by 1.7 degrees Fahrenheit with the onset of spring (defined as the date when daily temperatures have reached 50 degrees Fahrenheit for 10 days in a row) coming three to 10 days earlier since 1950.

Information derived from paleoclimate archives provides a long-term context of past climates.\nDifferent types of environmental evidence are used to understand what the Earth\u2019s past climate was like and why. Records of historical climate conditions are preserved in tree rings, locked in the skeletons of tropical coral reefs, sealed in glaciers and ice caps, and buried in laminated sediments from lakes and the ocean.\nScientists can use those environmental recorders to estimate past conditions, extending our understanding of climate back hundreds to millions of years.\nGlobal-scale observations from the instrumental era began in the mid-19th century, and paleoclimate reconstructions extend the record of some quantities back hundreds to millions of years. Together, this provides a comprehensive view of the variability and long-term changes in the atmosphere, the ocean, the cryosphere and at the land surface.\nThe Earth\u2019s climate is changing, and it is projected to continue changing over the next century.\nThe magnitude of climate change beyond the next few decades will depend primarily on the amount of greenhouse (heat-trapping) gases emitted globally and on the remaining uncertainty about the Earth\u2019s climate's sensitivity to those emissions.\nWith significant reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the global annual average temperature rise could be limited to 2\u00b0C or less. However, without major reductions in these emissions, the increase in annual average global temperatures relative to preindustrial times could reach 5\u00b0C or more by the end of this century.\nThe global climate continues to change rapidly compared to the pace of natural climate variations throughout Earth\u2019s history. Trends in globally averaged temperature, sea level rise, upper-ocean heat content, land-based ice melt, arctic sea ice, depth of seasonal permafrost thaw, and other climate variables provide consistent evidence of a warming planet.\nThese observed trends are robust and confirmed by multiple independent research groups worldwide. Figure 1 shows global average temperature anomalies; since the 1880s, the global average temperature has warmed approximately 1\u00b0C.\nFIGURE 2\nThe period from 1983 to 2012 was likely the warmest 30-year period of the last 800 years and likely the warmest 30-year period of the previous 1400 years.\nFigure 4a shows the radiative forcing (W/m2) due to volcanic, solar, and well-mixed greenhouse gases (WMGHGs). Different colors illustrate the two existing data sets for volcanic forcing and four estimates of solar forcing and the grey line represents WMGHGs for the period from 850 to 2000.\nFigure 4b represents the simulated (red) and reconstructed (gray) Northern Hemisphere temperature anomalies for the period from 850 to 2000. The thick red line depicts the multi-model mean while the thin red lines show the multi-model 90% range. The overlap of reconstructed temperatures is shown by grey shading.\nIn Figure 3, model projections indicate that twenty-first-century global average warming will substantially exceed the Last Glacial Maximum period and even the warmest Holocene conditions, producing a climate state not previously experienced.\nFIGURE 3\nThe period from 1983 to 2012 was likely the warmest 30-year period of the last 800 years and likely the warmest 30-year period of the previous 1400 years.\nModel-simulated global temperature anomalies for the Last Glacial Maximum (21,000 years ago), the mid-Holocene (6,000 years ago), and projection for 2071\u20132095, under RCP8.5.\nEarth\u2019s climate is now changing faster than at any point in the known history of the climate, primarily as a result of human activities.\nThere is scientific consensus that unmitigated carbon emissions will lead to global warming of at least several degrees Celsius by 2100, resulting in high-impacts of local, regional and global risks to human society and natural ecosystems. Global climate change has already resulted in a wide range of impacts across every region of the earth as well as many economic sectors.\nImpacts related to climate change are evident across regions and in many sectors important to society, such as human health, agriculture and food security, water supply, transportation, energy, and biodiversity and ecosystems; impacts are expected to become increasingly disruptive in the coming decades.\nThere is very high confidence that the frequency and intensity of extreme heat and heavy precipitation events are increasing in most continental regions of the world. These trends are consistent with expected physical responses to a warming climate. The frequency and intensity of extreme high temperature events are virtually certain to increase in the future as global temperature increases.\nThere is high confidence that extreme precipitation events will very likely continue to increase in frequency and intensity throughout most of the world. Observed and projected trends for other types of extreme events, such as floods, droughts, and severe storms, have more variable regional characteristics.\nObserved changes over the 20th century include increases in global air and ocean temperature, rising global sea levels, long-term sustained widespread reduction of snow and ice cover, and changes in atmospheric and ocean circulation as well as regional weather patterns, which influence seasonal rainfall conditions.\nThese changes are caused by extra heat in the climate system due to the addition of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. These additional greenhouse gases are primarily input by human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), deforestation, agriculture, and land-use changes. These activities increase the amount of \u2018heat-trapping\u2019 greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\nThe pattern of observed changes in the climate system is consistent with an increase\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

While natural variability plays some part, the preponderance of evidence indicates that human activities\u2014particularly emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases\u2014are mostly responsible for making our planet warmer.\nAccording to an ongoing temperature analysis led by scientists at NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), the average global temperature on Earth has increased by at least 1.1\u00b0 Celsius (1.9\u00b0 Fahrenheit) since 1880. The majority of the warming has occurred since 1975, at a rate of roughly 0.15 to 0.20\u00b0C per decade.\nThe maps above show temperature anomalies in five-year increments since 1880. (Click on the arrow to run the animation.) These are not absolute temperatures, but changes from the norm for each area. The data reflect how much warmer or cooler each region was compared to a base period of 1951-1980. (The global mean surface air temperature for that period was 14\u00b0C (57\u00b0F), with an uncertainty of several tenths of a degree.)\nThe image below shows global temperature anomalies in 2022, which tied for the fifth warmest year on record. The past nine years have been the warmest years since modern recordkeeping began in 1880.\nAs the maps show, global warming does not mean temperatures rise everywhere at every time by same rate. Temperatures might rise 5 degrees in one region and drop 2 degrees in another. For instance, exceptionally cold winters in one place might be balanced by extremely warm winters in another part of the world. Generally, warming is greater over land than over the oceans because water is slower to absorb and release heat (thermal inertia). Warming may also differ substantially within specific land masses and ocean basins.\nIn the animation at the top of the page and in the bar chart below, the years from 1880 to 1939 tend to be cooler, then level off by the 1950s. Decades within the base period (1951-1980) do not appear particularly warm or cold because they are the standard against which other years are measured.\nThe leveling off of temperatures in the middle of the 20th century can be explained by natural variability and by the cooling effects of aerosols generated by factories, power plants, and motor vehicles in the years of rapid economic growth after World War II. Fossil fuel use also increased after the war (5 percent per year), boosting greenhouse gases. Cooling from aerosol pollution happened rapidly. In contrast, greenhouse gases accumulated slowly, but they remain in the atmosphere for a much longer time. According to former GISS director James Hansen, the strong warming trend of the past four decades likely reflects a shift from balanced aerosol and greenhouse gas effects on the atmosphere to a predominance of greenhouse gas effects after aerosols were curbed by pollution controls.\nWhy should we care about one or two degrees of global warming? After all, temperatures fluctuate by many degrees every day where we live.\nThe temperatures we experience locally and in short periods can fluctuate significantly due to predictable, cyclical events (night and day, summer and winter) and hard-to-predict wind and precipitation patterns. But the global temperature mainly depends on how much energy the planet receives from the Sun and how much it radiates back into space. The energy coming from the Sun fluctuates very little by year, while the amount of energy radiated by Earth is closely tied to the chemical composition of the atmosphere\u2014particularly the amount of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.\nA one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all of the oceans, the atmosphere, and the land masses by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age. A five-degree drop was enough to bury a large part of North America under a towering mass of ice 20,000 years ago.\nGlobal temperature records start around 1880 because observations did not sufficiently cover enough of the planet prior to that time. The line plot above shows yearly temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2020 as recorded by NASA, NOAA, the Berkeley Earth research group, the Met Office Hadley Centre (United Kingdom), and the Cowtan and Way analysis. Though there are minor variations from year to year, all five records show peaks and valleys in sync with each other. All show rapid warming in the past few decades, and all show the last decade as the warmest.\nThe NASA GISS team chose the period of 1951-1980 as its baseline largely because the U.S. National Weather Service uses a three-decade period to define \u201cnormal\u201d or average temperature. The GISS temperature analysis effort also began around 1980, so the most recent 30 years was 1951-1980. Their objective is to provide an estimate of temperature change that could be compared with predictions of global climate change in response to atmospheric carbon dioxide, aerosols, and changes in solar activity.\nNASA\u2019s temperature analyses incorporate surface temperature measurements from more than 20,000 weather stations, ship- and buoy-based observations of sea surface temperatures, and temperature measurements from Antarctic research stations. These in situ measurements are analyzed using an algorithm that considers the varied spacing of temperature stations around the globe and urban heat island effects.\nSubscribe to the Earth Observatory and get the Earth in your inbox.\nNASA's Earth Observatory brings you the Earth, every day, with in-depth stories and stunning imagery.\nExplore Earth Science\nEarth Science Data\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

( high confidence) {6.7}\nNet-zero energy systems will share common characteristics, but the approach in every country will depend on national circumstances. Common characteristics of net-zero energy systems will include: (i) electricity systems that produce no net CO2 or remove CO2 from the atmosphere; (ii) widespread electrification of end uses, including light-duty transport, space heating, and cooking; (iii) substantially lower use of fossil fuels than today; (iv) use of alternative energy carriers such as hydrogen, bioenergy, and ammonia to substitute for fossil fuels in sectors less amenable to electrification; (v) more efficient use of energy than today; (vi) greater energy system integration across regions and across components of the energy system; and (vii) use of CO2 removal (e.g., direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS) and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (DACCS, BECCS)) to offset any residual emissions. (high confidence) {6.6}\nEnergy demands and energy sector emissions have continued to rise. From 2015 to 2019, global final energy consumption grew by 6.6%, CO2 emissions from the global energy system grew by 4.6%, and total GHG emissions from energy supply rose by 2.7%. Methane emissions, mainly fugitive emissions from oil, gas, and coal, accounted for 18% of GHG emissions in 2019. Coal electricity capacity grew by 7.6% between 2015 and 2019, as new builds in some countries offset declines in others. Total consumption of oil and oil products increased by 5%, and natural gas consumption grew by 15%. Declining energy intensity in almost all regions has been balanced by increased energy consumption. ( high confidence) {6.3}\nPrices have dropped rapidly over the last five years for several key energy system mitigation options, notably solar photovoltaics (PV), wind power, and batteries. From 2015 to 2020, the prices of electricity from PV and wind dropped 56% and 45%, respectively, and battery prices dropped by 64%. Electricity from PV and wind is now cheaper than electricity from fossil sources in many regions, electric vehicles are increasingly competitive with internal combustion engines, and large-scale battery storage on electricity grids is increasingly viable. ( high confidence) {6.3, 6.4}\nGlobal wind and solar PV capacity and generation have increased rapidly. Solar PV grew by 170% (to 680 TWh); wind grew by 70% (to 1420 TWh) from 2015 to 2019. Policy, societal pressure to limit fossil generation, low interest rates, and cost reductions have all driven wind and solar PV deployment. Solar PV and wind together accounted for 21% of total low-carbon electricity generation and 8% of total electricity generation in 2019. Nuclear generation grew 9% between 2015 and 2019 and accounted for 10% of total generation in 2019 (2790 TWh); hydroelectric power grew by 10% and accounted for 16% (4290 TWh) of total generation. In total,low- and zero-carbon electricity generation technologies produced 37% of global electricity in 2019. ( high confidence) {6.3, 6.4}\nIf investments in coal and other fossil infrastructure continue, energy systems will be locked in to higher emissions, making it harder to limit warming to well below 2\u00b0C. Many aspects of the energy system \u2013 physical infrastructure; institutions, laws, and regulations; and behaviour \u2013 are resistant to change or take many years to change. New investments in coal-fired electricity without CCS are inconsistent with limiting warming to well below 2\u00b0C. ( high confidence) {6.3, 6.7}\nLimiting warming to well below 2\u00b0C will strand fossil-related assets, including fossil infrastructure and unburned fossil fuel resources. The economic impact of stranded assets could amount to trillions of dollars. Coal assets are most vulnerable over the coming decade; oil and gas assets are more vulnerable toward mid-century. CCS can allow fossil fuels to be used longer, reducing potential stranded assets. ( high confidence) {6.7}\nA low-carbon energy transition will shift investment patterns and create new economic opportunities. Total energy investment needs will rise, relative to today, over the next decades, if warming is limited to 2\u00b0C (>67%) or lower. These increases will be far less pronounced, however, than the reallocations of investment flows that are likely to be seen across sub-sectors, namely from fossil fuels (extraction, conversion, and electricity generation) without CCS and toward renewables, n\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Information.\nAccording to the annual report from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, 2024 was the warmest year since global records began in 1850. The global average surface temperature was 2.32 Fahrenheit (1.29 degrees Celsius) above the 20th-century average (57.0 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.9 degrees Celsius) and 2.63 degrees Fahrenheit (1.46 degrees Celsius) above the pre-industrial average (56.7 degrees Fahrenheit, or 13.7 degrees Celsius), which NOAA defines as the period from 1850-1900.\nGlobal temperatures in 2024 were above the 1991-2020 average (red) across most of the planet. Yearly temperatures compared to the 20th-century average (bar chart) show that it has been 48 years since Earth had a cooler-than-average year. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe 2024 global temperature anomaly (anomaly means \u201cdifference from average\u201d) is 0.18 degrees F (0.10 degrees C) warmer than the previous record, set the year before, in 2023. The ten warmest years in the 175-year record have all occurred during the last decade (2015\u20132024). When the new century started in 2000, the first year to set a new high-temperature record was 2005. Now, 2005 is just the 13th-warmest year on record.\nOther 2024 rankings included...\nFor more regional details and 2024 climate statistics, see the 2024 Global Climate Report from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe global average surface temperature is an indicator of the state of Earth\u2019s energy balance: how much sunlight it absorbs minus how much heat it radiates back to space. When these amounts are the same, Earth\u2019s average surface temperature remains steady. When they are out of balance, Earth cools or warms. Earth\u2019s average surface temperature has been rising because human-produced greenhouse gases are causing Earth to absorb more energy than it radiates back to space.\nGiven the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of added heat energy to raise Earth\u2019s average surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree-Fahrenheit (1-degree-Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1850-1900 in NOAA's record) might seem small, but it represents a significant increase in heat energy circulating through all parts of the Earth system, including the oceans, frozen landscapes, and the atmosphere.\nBeyond being an indicator of changes in Earth\u2019s energy balance, surface temperature matters because it controls many environmental and ecological processes that are important to humans and other life, including the water cycle (evaporation, clouds, surface water supplies, and precipitation), the carbon cycle, and the kinds of plants, animals, and other living things that can survive in different places on Earth.\nThe concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (55 degrees Celsius) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the \"average\" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget, which can only be directly measured from space.\nTo calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute temperature readings to temperature anomalies\u2014the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend.\nAcross inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and known physical relationships\u2014such as the way temperature decreases with altitude\u2014to estimate the missing values. Each value is then used to calculate a global-scale temperature anomaly. This process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in Earth's surface temperature over time. Read more about how the global surface temperature record is built in our Climate Data Primer.\nTemperature change has not been uniform across the planet, but more areas are warming than cooling. And the rate of warming has accelerated in recent decades. According to NOAA's 2024 Annual Climate Report the combined land and ocean temperature has warmed at an average rate of 0.11 degrees Fahrenheit (0.06 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1850 and more than three times that rate (0.36 degrees Fahrenheit, or 0.20 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1975.\nRecent rates of global warming (1994-2024, bottom) are larger than the longer-term average rates (1901-2024, top). Places that have cooled are colored blue; places that have warmed are colored yellow, orange, or red. In the past three decades, many places in the Northern Hemisphere have warmed by 1 degree Fahrenheit or more per decade. Differences are most dramatic in the Arctic. With the decline of ice and snow, the Arctic reflects less incoming sunlight, which amplifies the rate of greenhouse-gas-driven warming. NOAA Climate.gov, based o\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The controversy may be fed by the existence of scientists from other disciplines publicly casting doubt on the validity of climate science. The extent to which non-climate scientists are skeptical of climate science has not been studied via direct survey. Here we report on a survey of biophysical scientists across disciplines at universities in the Big 10 Conference. Most respondents (93.6%) believe that mean temperatures have risen and most (91.9%) believe in an anthropogenic contribution to rising temperatures. Respondents strongly believe that climate science is credible (mean credibility score 6.67/7). Those who disagree about climate change disagree over basic facts (e.g., the effects of CO2 on climate) and have different cultural and political values. These results suggest that scientists who are climate change skeptics are outliers and that the majority of scientists surveyed believe in anthropogenic climate change and that climate science is credible and mature.\nExport citation and abstractBibTeXRIS\nContent from this work may be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licence.

Approximately 97% of active, publishing climate scientists believe4 in anthropogenic climate change (Doran and Zimmerman 2009, Anderegg et al 2010) and about 97% of papers published about climate change with an explicit position on the existence of climate change affirm that it is occurring (Cook et al 2013). However, only approximately half of the American public believes in anthropogenic climate change (Leiserowitz et al 2010, Weber and Stern 2011). There are many reasons for public doubt in climate change, including cognitive and affective factors (Gifford 2011, McCright and Dunlap 2011) and media coverage that gives undue weight to the climate change controversy (Boykoff and Boykoff 2004, Boykoff 2007) or is influenced by political ideology (Dotson et al 2012). Scientists who are publicly skeptical about climate science and anthropogenic climate change may also contribute to public disbelief in climate change. These scientists often specialize in disciplines other than climate science and typically are not currently researching climate issues (Jacques et al 2008, Lahsen 2008, Anderegg et al 2010). Concern has been expressed (McCright and Dunlap 2003, Jacques et al 2008) that these scientific skeptics have added false scientific credibility to skepticism. But is it false? Are non-climate scientist skeptics representative of the broader scientific community? What influences scientists\u2019 belief in climate change? Though many scientific organizations have produced climate change position statements affirming the existence of anthropogenic climate change (Oreskes 2004), the drafting of these statements is at times controversial and is often done without directly polling membership (Stenhouse et al 2014). This question is especially significant in the United States, which is the second-largest global emitter of carbon dioxide (Boden et al 2013). Here, we report on a survey of biophysical scientists at universities in the Big 10 Conference, a group of large, research-oriented universities in the United States (see Methods section for more details on the sample). The results show that scientists across disciplines nearly unanimously believe in anthropogenic climate change, are highly certain that climate change is happening, and find climate science to be trustworthy and credible.\nDisagreement about climate change is rarely a simple dispute about facts. Indeed, people\u2019s interpretation of climate change information appears to be influenced by cognitive factors and motivated reasoning (Kellstedt et al 2008, Gifford 2011, Hart and Nisbet 2012, Kahan et al 2012, Carlton and Jacobson 2013, Carlton and Jacobson 2015). Notably, perceptions about risks such as climate change have been shown to be affected by where people fit on two cultural values scales: individualism versus communitarianism and hierarchicalism versus egalitarianism (Kahan et al 2008, Kahan et al 2012). People with more individualistic than communitarian values tend to believe that individuals (as opposed to communities) are responsible for their own well being without help or interference from society. People who hold more hierarchical than egalitarian values tend to believe that authority comes from strict social order based on characteristics such as race, gender, and class. These cultural values influence how people interpret information about risks. According to the cultural cognition hypothesis, hierarchical individualists are more skeptical of environmental risks, including climate change, because accepting these risks would undermine hierarchical individualists\u2019 belief in commerce and industry. Those who hold more egalitarian and communitarian values tend to perceive environmental risks more acutely because they feel that commerce and industry (the drivers of many environmental risks) promote individuals over the community (Kahan et al 2011, Kahan et al 2012). Cultural cognition appears to influence climate change beliefs among everyone, not just those who are uninformed about climate change or who have insufficient reasoning skills to properly evaluate the evidence for anthropogenic climate change. In fact, the effects of cultural cog\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Two-thirds of the warming has occurred since 1975.\n\nFull Page Content:\nOur climate is changing in many ways. One of the clearest signs is that the world is warming. Scientists know this through evidence compiled from satellites, weather balloons, thermometers, weather stations and more.1 Since 1880, average global temperatures have increased by about 1 degrees Celsius (1.7\u00b0 degrees Fahrenheit). Global temperature is projected to warm by about 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7\u00b0 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2050 and 2-4 degrees Celsius (3.6-7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100.2\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) [exit DNR], average annual global temperatures have increased steadily since the 1960s. Figure 1 shows deviations from the average global temperature depicted as the horizontal line at 0.00 degrees Celsius. Every blue bar is a year that was colder than the average temperature of the 20th century. Red bars are years that were warmer than the 20th century average. Nineteen of the 20 warmest years have occurred since 2001. It is likely that the coldest year moving forward will be warmer than the warmest year that we experienced in the 20th century.\nTo determine changes in Wisconsin temperature and precipitation, scientists from the University of Wisconsin-Madison analyzed temperature records from a statewide network compiled by the National Climatic Data Center. This dataset shows that Wisconsin has become 2 degrees Fahrenheit warmer and 4.5 inches (14 percent) wetter since the 1950s, with the greatest warming during winter and the largest precipitation increase during summer (Figure 2).\nRecordings of daily atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), initiated by Dr. Charles David Keeling of the Scripps Institute of Oceanography, help to tell the story of increasing CO2 levels. Keeling was curious whether the increasing amounts of fossil fuel being combusted would affect atmospheric CO2 levels. So, in 1958 he began to record daily atmospheric CO2 levels at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. Mauna Loa was selected as a long-term monitoring site because it was far from other continents and vegetation that could affect the CO2 concentration. The daily recordings are considered one of the world\u2019s greatest scientific contributions.\nKeeling's measurements discovered an annual planetary cycle in CO2 , in which CO2 levels rise and fall seasonally (Figure 3). This cycle is tied to photosynthesis. In the spring as plants grow, they take carbon dioxide from the air and using the energy from sunlight, convert it into carbon and release oxygen. In the fall as plants die, they release CO2 and global CO2 readings rise.\nIn addition to the seasonal cycling, Keeling also recorded an increase in CO2 concentration over time, from 313 parts per million (ppm) in 1958 to 415 ppm as of March 30, 2020. This rise in CO2 concentration, known as the Keeling Curve has transformed the way scientists understand the source of CO2\nScientists understand the source of CO2 in the atmosphere from several lines of evidence, including measurements of Antarctic ice cores that go back 800,000 years. Antarctic ice cores contain our atmosphere\u2019s history in bubbles of air that were trapped hundreds of thousands of years ago when the ice was first formed. Scientists can analyze these bubbles to determine how CO2 levels have changed over time.3 The cores show that for the last 800,000 years, until about 1900, CO2 levels were relatively stable, fluctuating between about 150 and 280 ppm. In the early 1900s, CO2 started to increase at an unprecedented rate. Today, only 120 years later, CO2 levels are 40 percent higher than they were before the industrial revolution (Figure 4).\nCO2 emissions make up the vast majority of greenhouse gases (GHG) that warm the planet. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources Air Management Program has prepared the Wisconsin Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory (1990-2021) [PDF], identifying CO2 and other GHG emissions in Wisconsin for 2005 and 2021, and describing emission trends from 1990 through 2021. Report authors used the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s State Inventory Tool populated with default data.\nResearch conducted by the Wisconsin Initiative on Climate Change Impacts (WICCI) [exit DNR], a collaboration of more than 200 scientists and practitioners, provides useful information on the impacts of climate changes, adaptive strategies and solutions to both store carbon and reduce carbon emissions. The University of Wisconsin-Madison's Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources lead WICCI.\nWICCI climate scientists have been able to project local temperature and precipitation patterns for Wisconsin. The scientists took taking global climate models that simulate climate changes on a large scale (typically 100-200 miles) and downscaled them to approximately six miles. The downscaled models have allowed scientists to forecast more realistic, localized temperature and precipitation changes, and changes in extreme weather events. WICCI scientists are continuing to work with people around the state to fine-tune these models and provide forecasts for other climate factors that are important to impacts in Wisconsin.\nWisconsin is likely to become a much warmer state over the next few decades, with average temperatures closer to southern Illinois or Missouri. Results show that Wisconsin has warmed 2 to 3 degrees Fahrenheit since 1950, and it is projected that the state will warm an additional 2 to 8 degrees by 2050 (Figure 5). We will also likely see a tripling in the frequency of extreme heat (days above 90 degrees Fahrenheit), rising from about 10 days per year in 2020 to about 30 days per year by 2050 (Figure 6).\nSeasonal temperatures have also changed. Spring temperatures have increased by 1.7 degrees Fahrenheit with the onset of spring (defined as the date when daily temperatures have reached 50 degrees Fahrenheit for 10 days in a row) coming three to 10 days earlier since 1950.

In scenarios limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot (2\u00b0C (>67%) with action starting in 2020), net energy system CO2 emissions (interquartile range) fall by 87\u201397% (60\u201379%) in 2050. In 2030, in scenarios limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot, net CO2 and GHG emissions fall by 35\u201351% and 38\u201352% respectively. In scenarios limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot (2\u00b0C (>67%)), net electricity sector CO2 emissions reach zero globally between 2045 and 2055 (2050 and 2080). ( high confidence) {6.7}\nLimiting warming to well below 2\u00b0C will require substantial energy system changes over the next 30 years. This includes reduced fossil fuel consumption, increased production from low- and zero-carbon energy sources, and increased use of electricity and alternative energy carriers. Coal consumption without carbon capture and storage (CCS) falls by 67\u201382% (interquartile range) in 2030 in scenarios limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot. Oil and gas consumption fall more slowly. Low-carbon sources produce 93\u201397% of global electricity by 2050 in scenarios that limit warming to 2\u00b0C (>67%) with action starting in 2020. In scenarios limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot (2\u00b0C (>67%) with action starting in 2020), electricity supplies 48\u201358% (36\u201347%) of final energy in 2050, up from 20% in 2019. ( high confidence) {6.7}\nNet-zero energy systems will share common characteristics, but the approach in every country will depend on national circumstances. Common characteristics of net-zero energy systems will include: (i) electricity systems that produce no net CO2 or remove CO2 from the atmosphere; (ii) widespread electrification of end uses, including light-duty transport, space heating, and cooking; (iii) substantially lower use of fossil fuels than today; (iv) use of alternative energy carriers such as hydrogen, bioenergy, and ammonia to substitute for fossil fuels in sectors less amenable to electrification; (v) more efficient use of energy than today; (vi) greater energy system integration across regions and across components of the energy system; and (vii) use of CO2 removal (e.g., direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS) and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (DACCS, BECCS)) to offset any residual emissions. (high confidence) {6.6}\nEnergy demands and energy sector emissions have continued to rise. From 2015 to 2019, global final energy consumption grew by 6.6%, CO2 emissions from the global energy system grew by 4.6%, and total GHG emissions from energy supply rose by 2.7%. Methane emissions, mainly fugitive emissions from oil, gas, and coal, accounted for 18% of GHG emissions in 2019. Coal electricity capacity grew by 7.6% between 2015 and 2019, as new builds in some countries offset declines in others. Total consumption of oil and oil products increased by 5%, and natural gas consumption grew by 15%. Declining energy intensity in almost all regions has been balanced by increased energy consumption. ( high confidence) {6.3}\nPrices have dropped rapidly over the last five years for several key energy system mitigation options, notably solar photovoltaics (PV), wind power, and batteries. From 2015 to 2020, the prices of electricity from PV and wind dropped 56% and 45%, respectively, and battery prices dropped by 64%. Electricity from PV and wind is now cheaper than electricity from fossil sources in many regions, electric vehicles are increasingly competitive with internal combustion engines, and large-scale battery storage on electricity grids is increasingly viable. ( high confidence) {6.3, 6.4}\nGlobal wind and solar PV capacity and generation have increased rapidly. Solar PV grew by 170% (to 680 TWh); wind grew by 70% (to 1420 TWh) from 2015 to 2019. Policy, societal pressure to limit fossil generation, low interest rates, and cost reductions have all driven wind and solar PV deployment. Solar PV and wind together accounted for 21% of total low-carbon electricity generation and 8% of total electricity generation in 2019. Nuclear generation grew 9% between 2015 and 2019 and accounted for 10% of total generation in 2019 (2790 TWh); hydroelectric power grew by 10% and accounted for 16% (4290 TWh) of total generation. In total,low- and zero-carbon electricity generation technologies produced 37% of global electricity in 2019. ( high confidence) {6.3, 6.4}\nIf investments in coal and other fossil infrastructure continue, energy systems will be locked in to higher emissions, making it harder to limit warming to well below 2\u00b0C. Many aspects of the energy system \u2013 physical infrastructure; institutions, laws, and regulations; and behaviour \u2013 are resistant to change or take many years to change. New investments in coal-fired electricity without CCS are inconsistent with limiting warming to well below 2\u00b0C. ( high confidence) {6.3, 6.7}\nLimiting warming to well below 2\u00b0C will strand fossil-related assets, including fossil infrastructure and unburned fossil fuel resources. The economic impact of stranded assets could amount to trillions of dollars. Coal assets are most vulnerable over the coming decade; oil and gas assets are more vulnerable toward mid-century. CCS can allow fossil fuels to be used longer, reducing potential stranded assets. ( high confidence) {6.7}\nA low-carbon energy transition will shift investment patterns and create new economic opportunities. Total energy investment needs will rise, relative to today, over the next decades, if warming is limited to 2\u00b0C (>67%) or lower. These increases will be far less pronounced, however, than the reallocations of investment flows that are likely to be seen across sub-sectors, namely from fossil fuels (extraction, conversion, and electricity generation) without CCS and toward renewables, n\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The years 2015\u20132017 each had a global temperature departure from average that was more than 1.0\u00b0C (1.8\u00b0F) above the 1880\u20131900 average, which is a period that is commonly used to represent the pre-industrial conditions. However, 2018 was just shy of reaching the 1.0\u00b0C (1.8\u00b0F) mark at 0.97\u00b0C (1.75\u00b0F). The year began with a La Ni\u00f1a episode present across the tropical Pacific Ocean, transitioning to ENSO-neutral by April 2018.\n2018 also marks the 42nd consecutive year (since 1977) with global land and ocean temperatures, at least nominally, above the 20th century average. During the 21st century, the global land and ocean temperature departure from average has reached new record highs five times (2005, 2010, 2014, 2015, and 2016), with three of those being set back-to-back. From 1880 to 1980, a new temperature record was set on average every 13 years; however, for the period 1981\u20132018, the frequency of a new record has increased on average to once every three years.\nNine of the 10 warmest years (listed below) have occurred since 2005, with the last five years (2014\u20132018) ranking as the five warmest years on record. The year 1998 is the only year from the 20th century among the ten warmest years on record, currently tying with 2009 as the ninth warmest year on record.\nThe yearly global land and ocean temperature has increased at an average rate of 0.07\u00b0C (0.13\u00b0F) per decade since 1880; however, the average rate of increase since 1981 (0.17\u00b0C / 0.31\u00b0F) is more than twice as great.\nThe following table lists the global combined land and ocean annually-averaged temperature rank and anomaly for each of the 10 warmest years on record.\nThe 1901\u20132000 average combined land and ocean annual temperature is 13.9\u00b0C (57.0\u00b0F), the annually averaged land temperature for the same period is 8.5\u00b0C (47.3\u00b0F), and the long-term annually averaged sea surface temperature is 16.1\u00b0C (60.9\u00b0F).\nThe following information was compiled from previous NCEI monitoring reports and public reports by National Hydrometeorological Services (NHMSs; peers of the U.S. National Weather Service).\nTemperatures across much of the world were warmer- to much-warmer-than-average during 2018. Record warm temperatures were measured across much of Europe and the Mediterranean Sea, the Middle East, New Zealand and surrounding ocean, and across parts of Asia, the Atlantic Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean. Averaged separately, the global land-only surface temperature for 2018 was 1.12\u00b0C (2.02\u00b0F) above the 20th century average\u2014the fourth highest annual temperature since global records began in 1880. The global ocean-only surface temperature was also the fourth highest on record at +0.66\u00b0C (+1.19\u00b0F).\nNorth America's 2018 continental temperature was the 18th highest since continental records began in 1910 at 0.73\u00b0C (1.31\u00b0F). The yearly temperature for North America has increased at an average rate of 0.12\u00b0C (0.22\u00b0F) per decade since 1880; however, the average rate of increase is more than twice (0.29\u00b0C / 0.52\u00b0F) as great since 1981.\nThe 2018 temperature across South America was the eighth highest on record. South America's trend during the 1910\u20132018 period was 0.15\u00b0C (0.27\u00b0F) per decade and 0.19\u00b0C (0.34\u00b0F) per decade since 1981. The years 2014\u20132017 comprise South America's four warmest years on record, with 2015 the record warm year.\nMuch-warmer-than-average conditions were present across Europe for most of 2018, with eight of 10 months ranking among the three warmest respective months on record. The months of February and March 2018 were cooler than normal, resulting in the coolest such months since 2012 and 2013, respectively. Overall, the 2018 European average temperature departure from average was the highest on record at 1.78\u00b0C (3.20\u00b0F) since continental records began in 1910. This value exceeds the previous record set in 2014 by 0.07\u00b0C (0.13\u00b0F). Overall, Europe's annual temperature has increased at an average rate of 0.12\u00b0C (0.22\u00b0F) per decade since 1910; however, it has almost quadrupled to 0.43\u00b0C (0.77\u00b0F) since 1981.\nAfrica had its fifth warmest year on record at 1.01\u00b0C (1.82\u00b0F). The five warmest years for Africa have occurred since 2010. Africa's annual temperature has increased at average rate of 0.10\u00b0C (0.18\u00b0F) per decade since 1910; however, it has almost tripled to 0.28\u00b0C (0.50\u00b0F) since 1981.\nThe 2018 temperature for Asia as 1.26\u00b0C (2.27\u00b0F) above average and the seventh highest in the 109-year record. Asia's trend during the 1910\u20132018 period was +0.14\u00b0C (+0.25\u00b0F) per decade; however, the trend is a little over double during the 1981\u20132018 period (+0.33\u00b0C / +0.59\u00b0F) per decade.\nOceania, as a whole, had its third warmest year on record at 1.15\u00b0C (2.07\u00b0F) above average. The record year was set in 2013 at +1.25\u00b0C (+2.25\u00b0F). The 1910\u20132018 trend for Oceania was +0.11\u00b0C (+0.20\u00b0F) per decade; however, the trend is twice that during the 1981\u20132018 period (+0.21\u00b0C / +0.38\u00b0F) per decade.\nAs indicated by the Global Percent of Normal Precipitation and Precipitation Percentiles maps below and as is typical, many stations were wet for the year, while many stations were dry. Also, as discussed below, extreme precipitation and drought events occurred across the world.\nJanuary 2018 was Austria's wettest January since 1982 at 170% of normal January precipitation. However, several locations across the nation set new precipitation records. Of interest, Nauders in Tyrol (western Austria) had a monthly total of 163.0 mm (6.4 inches) for January 2018, resulting in the highest precipitation total since records began in 1896.\nSeveral storms impacted France during January 2018. Several locations had two to three times the monthly normal precipitation for the month. The national precipitation total was 80% above average and the wettest January since 1959.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

LINDZEN, MIT PROFESSOR OF ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE- On Global Warming Fears: I think it's mainly just like little kids locking themselves in dark closets to see how much they can scare each other and themselves.\nAnd there's a lot of confusion in this and, you know, at the heart of it, we're talking of a few tenths of a degree change in temperature. None of it in the last eight years, by the way. And if we had warming, it should be accomplished by less storminess. But because the temperature itself is so unspectacular, we have developed all sorts of fear of prospect scenarios -- of flooding, of plague, of increased storminess when the physics says we should see less.\nLindzen on \u2018Symbolic\u2019 Solutions to Global Warming Lindzen:\n\"[I]f there's anything that there is a consensus on, [it is that we] will do very little to affect climate. So right now despite all of the claims to the contrary, we're talking about symbolism. And I think Julian's point is correct. Do you spend a lot? Do you distort a great deal in the economy for symbolism? And I think future generations are not going to blame us for anything except for being silly, for letting a few tenths of a degree panic us.\nAnd I think nobody is arguing about whether our climate is changing. It's always changing. Sea level has been rising since the end of the last ice age. The experts on it in the IPCC have freely acknowledged there's no strong evidence it's accelerating.\nLindzen Says UN IPCC does not Reflect Thousands of Scientists \u2013 Only a Dozen or so Scientists:\nSenator Inhofe was absolutely right. All that's coming out Friday is a summary for policymakers that is not prepared by scientists. Rob is wrong. It's not 2,500 people offering their consensus, I participated in that. Each person who is an author writes one or two pages in conjunction with someone else. They travel around the world several times a year for several years to write it and the summary for policymakers has the input of about 13 of the scientists, but ultimately, it is written by representatives of governments, of environmental organizations like the Union of Concerned Scientists, and industrial organizations, each seeking their own benefit.\nLindzen Debates Bill Nye, PBS TV\u2019s the \"Science Guy\" on Scientific Accuracy\nLINDZEN: Not at all. I think time will tell. I think Mr. Nye is speaking about energy. Energy sources and balance have changed over time, it will change. I have no idea what the energy mix will be 50 years from now. But I think if what he says about profitable, better sources are there, they will come online and they will come online without government fiat. Heidi [Cullen] says the science is solid and I can't criticize her because she never says what science she's talking about. This is a problem with so many facets, that the notion that scientists are in lock, that bonnet is silly.\nLARRY KING: Yes.\nBill Nye, where is Richard Lindzen wrong?\nBILL NYE, \"THE SCIENCE GUY,\" SCIENTIST, BEST-SELLING AUTHOR, TV PERSONALITY: Well, he -- I'm not sure, because I'm not -- I'm not an expert on his ideas.\nBut the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change, the IPCC report, which comes out Friday, is pretty compelling. And, as you know, I'm a member of the advisory board of the Union of Concerned Scientists and I find my colleagues pretty compelling, much more so than his -- his view is -- is a minority on a scale that's -- that's impressive. It's probably 100,000 to one or so, scientists versus him.\nKING: All right, Richard, are you... NYE: But I don't want it to get to be a personal attack. And...\nKING: OK, Richard, are you -- are you one of the alone ones in this?\nLINDZEN: You know, on what I was just saying, I was saying textbook material. And if the textbooks are out voiced by environmental advocacy groups like Union of Concerned Scientists by 100,000 to one -- that would be bizarre. We should close down our schools.\nThis makes no sense, what Mr. Nye is say\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Additionally, a high-reliability source discusses competing scientific perspectives, indicating that the assertion of catastrophe is not uniformly held."

LINDZEN, MIT PROFESSOR OF ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE- On Global Warming Fears: I think it's mainly just like little kids locking themselves in dark closets to see how much they can scare each other and themselves.\nAnd there's a lot of confusion in this and, you know, at the heart of it, we're talking of a few tenths of a degree change in temperature. None of it in the last eight years, by the way. And if we had warming, it should be accomplished by less storminess. But because the temperature itself is so unspectacular, we have developed all sorts of fear of prospect scenarios -- of flooding, of plague, of increased storminess when the physics says we should see less.\nLindzen on \u2018Symbolic\u2019 Solutions to Global Warming Lindzen:\n\"[I]f there's anything that there is a consensus on, [it is that we] will do very little to affect climate. So right now despite all of the claims to the contrary, we're talking about symbolism. And I think Julian's point is correct. Do you spend a lot? Do you distort a great deal in the economy for symbolism? And I think future generations are not going to blame us for anything except for being silly, for letting a few tenths of a degree panic us.\nAnd I think nobody is arguing about whether our climate is changing. It's always changing. Sea level has been rising since the end of the last ice age. The experts on it in the IPCC have freely acknowledged there's no strong evidence it's accelerating.\nLindzen Says UN IPCC does not Reflect Thousands of Scientists \u2013 Only a Dozen or so Scientists:\nSenator Inhofe was absolutely right. All that's coming out Friday is a summary for policymakers that is not prepared by scientists. Rob is wrong. It's not 2,500 people offering their consensus, I participated in that. Each person who is an author writes one or two pages in conjunction with someone else. They travel around the world several times a year for several years to write it and the summary for policymakers has the input of about 13 of the scientists, but ultimately, it is written by representatives of governments, of environmental organizations like the Union of Concerned Scientists, and industrial organizations, each seeking their own benefit.\nLindzen Debates Bill Nye, PBS TV\u2019s the \"Science Guy\" on Scientific Accuracy\nLINDZEN: Not at all. I think time will tell. I think Mr. Nye is speaking about energy. Energy sources and balance have changed over time, it will change. I have no idea what the energy mix will be 50 years from now. But I think if what he says about profitable, better sources are there, they will come online and they will come online without government fiat. Heidi [Cullen] says the science is solid and I can't criticize her because she never says what science she's talking about. This is a problem with so many facets, that the notion that scientists are in lock, that bonnet is silly.\nLARRY KING: Yes.\nBill Nye, where is Richard Lindzen wrong?\nBILL NYE, \"THE SCIENCE GUY,\" SCIENTIST, BEST-SELLING AUTHOR, TV PERSONALITY: Well, he -- I'm not sure, because I'm not -- I'm not an expert on his ideas.\nBut the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change, the IPCC report, which comes out Friday, is pretty compelling.
