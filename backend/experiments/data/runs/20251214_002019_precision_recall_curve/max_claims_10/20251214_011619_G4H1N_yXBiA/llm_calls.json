Some groups of people are more at risk of illness and death than others, because they are more likely to be exposed, or are more vulnerable to health harm, or often both.\nRespiratory\nOther\nParticle pollution \u2013 also known as particulate matter or soot \u2013 is a deadly and growing threat to public health in communities around the country. The more researchers learn about the health effects of particle pollution, the more dangerous it is recognized to be.\nGround-level ozone, sometimes known as smog, is one of the most widespread and dangerous pollutants in the United States. Scientists have studied the effects of ozone on human health for decades. Hundreds of studies have confirmed that ozone harms people at levels currently found in many parts of the United States.\nThe health burden of air pollution is not evenly shared. Some people are more at risk of illness and death from air pollution than others. Several key factors affect an individual\u2019s level of risk:\nThese risk factors are not mutually exclusive and often interact in ways that lead to significant health inequities among subgroups of the population. Taken all together, these high-risk categories account for a large proportion of the U.S. population.\nHealth Effects Institute. State of Global Air. Boston, MA. 2024.\nU.S. EPA.

Here, Harvard Chan environmental health experts explain how air pollution affects the heart, what components of air pollution are most dangerous, and steps people can take to protect themselves.\nAir pollution has been linked with a long list of serious health outcomes. In slide presentations, Francine Laden uses a graphic illustration that shows the wide range of damage that has been linked to pollutants. The graphic features an outline of a human body. Over a series of slides, the body becomes covered with about two dozen word bubbles referencing studies that have found links between air pollution and conditions ranging from lung cancer to cognitive decline to infertility. It has also been linked with premature death.\n\u201cAnd those are all the outcomes that just [Harvard researchers] have looked at,\u201d said Laden, professor of environmental epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. \u201cIt\u2019s just overwhelming in terms of all the different associations that you can find with air pollution.\u201d\nCardiovascular health risks sit atop that hefty list, Laden and other Harvard Chan experts agree. Yet while people intuitively make the connection between air pollution and lung damage, the connection with its impact on heart health\u2014for which there is \u201cincontrovertible evidence,\u201d according to Kari Nadeau, John Rock Professor of Climate and Population Studies and chair of the Department of Environmental Health\u2014may not be top of mind.\n\u201cFrom my perspective, while people are increasingly understanding that air pollution affects the cardiovascular system, not enough really get it,\u201d said Nadeau, an allergy and asthma specialist who works with children and adults. \u201cMy typical patient doesn\u2019t see the connection automatically. I have to explain it to them, and then they understand it.\u201d Added Mary Rice, Mark and Catherine Winkler Associate Professor of Environmental Respiratory Health, director of the Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment, and a pulmonologist who sees many patients with both chronic lung disease and heart disease, \u201cI don\u2019t think most people realize just how harmful air pollution is to our health, because it is mostly invisible.\u201d\nDoug Dockery, John L. Loeb and Frances Lehman Loeb Professor of Environmental Epidemiology, Emeritus, led the landmark 1993 Harvard Six Cities Study that revealed a strong link between air pollution and mortality risk. Referring to the risks posed by air pollution to heart health, he said, \u201cIt is a big issue. We\u2019re talking about millions of people affected.\u201d\nDockery cited a 2017 Lancet study that quantified the global burden of disease and death related to fine particulate matter, or PM2.5\u2014the most damaging component of air pollution. This type of pollution was responsible for some 4.2 million deaths globally in 2015, the study found. Of those deaths, 2.4 million were cardiovascular-related, far outpacing deaths from either chronic obstructive lung disease (863,000 deaths) or lung cancer deaths (283,300).\nSince the publication of the Six Cities Study, Harvard Chan School researchers have been at the forefront of much of the research on the connection between air pollution and cardiovascular impacts, co-authoring hundreds of papers on the topic\u2014and the work continues. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing that I\u2019m very proud of,\u201d noted Dockery, who formerly chaired the Department of Environmental Health. \u201cWe took the lead in this and were really instrumental in showing these associations.\u201d\nThe Six Cities Study played an early and crucial role in uncovering just how dangerous air pollution was, showing that its effects on mortality risk were much greater than had been observed in previous studies. The study generated years of criticism and questions about its quality. But numerous follow-up studies confirmed the findings, and ultimately the study helped pave the way for strengthened air quality standards in the U.S. and beyond.\nDockery admits that, when he was working on the Six Cities Study, he initially assumed that any link found between air pollution mortality risk would be because of respiratory disease\u2014not cardiovascular disease (CVD). \u201cWe weren\u2019t thinking about air pollution as a risk factor for CVD at that time,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, the original hypothesis of the Six Cities Study was that respirable particles would accelerate the development of and ultimately death from chronic obstructive lung disease.\u201d\nBut the results showed otherwise. \u201cWe found a very strong association with CVD deaths, but not with respiratory deaths,\u201d Dockery said. \u201cWe thought it must be a coding error\u2014we thought that respiratory deaths had been miscoded as CVD deaths.\u201d\nOver time, the connection between air pollution and CVD has become increasingly clear. Studies from Harvard Chan experts and others have shed light on a raft of cardiovascular harms associated with both long- and short-term air pollution exposures, including links with heart attack, stroke, and premature death and risk factors such as high blood pressure, heart rhythm and heart rate changes, and inflammation.\nDockery recalled a paper that showed one of the serious short-term effects of air pollution\u2014a 2001 study led by Annette Peters, who was doing a postdoctoral stint with him at the time. The study looked at patients with myocardial infarction (MI)\u2014heart attacks\u2014in the Boston area between January 1995 and May 1996. The researchers, including Dockery and Harvard Chan colleagues James Muller and Murray Mittleman, found that the risk of MI onset was higher if PM2.5 levels had been elevated in the previous two hours.\nJoel Schwartz, professor of environmental epidemiology, has also conducted pivotal research showing how air pollution affects CVD and other conditions. As early as 1994, he was publishing research showing that particles were associated with incre\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Over the last century, burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nHuman activities are driving the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century.\nScientists attribute the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century to the human expansion of the \"greenhouse effect\"1 \u2014 warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth toward space.\nLife on Earth depends on energy coming from the Sun. About half the light energy reaching Earth's atmosphere passes through the air and clouds to the surface, where it is absorbed and radiated in the form of infrared heat. About 90% of this heat is then absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-radiated, slowing heat loss to space.\nA vital component of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide (CO2) is released through natural processes (like volcanic eruptions) and through human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation.\nLike many atmospheric gases, methane comes from both natural and human-caused sources. Methane comes from plant-matter breakdown in wetlands and is also released from landfills and rice farming. Livestock animals emit methane from their digestion and manure. Leaks from fossil fuel production and transportation are another major source of methane, and natural gas is 70% to 90% methane.\nA potent greenhouse gas produced by farming practices, nitrous oxide is released during commercial and organic fertilizer production and use. Nitrous oxide also comes from burning fossil fuels and burning vegetation and has increased by 18% in the last 100 years.\nThese chemical compounds do not exist in nature \u2013 they are entirely of industrial origin. They were used as refrigerants, solvents (a substance that dissolves others), and spray can propellants.\nFORCING: Something acting upon Earth's climate that causes a change in how energy flows through it (such as long-lasting, heat-trapping gases - also known as greenhouse gases). These gases slow outgoing heat in the atmosphere and cause the planet to warm.\nWater vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas, but because the warming ocean increases the amount of it in our atmosphere, it is not a direct cause of climate change. Credit: John Fowler on Unsplash\nFEEDBACKS: A process where something is either amplified or reduced as time goes on, such as water vapor increasing as Earth warms leading to even more warming.\nOver the last century, burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). This increase happens because the coal or oil burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the air to make CO2. To a lesser extent, clearing of land for agriculture, industry, and other human activities has increased concentrations of greenhouse gases.\nThe industrial activities that our modern civilization depends upon have raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels by nearly 50% since 17502. This increase is due to human activities, because scientists can see a distinctive isotopic fingerprint in the atmosphere.\nIn its Sixth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, composed of scientific experts from countries all over the world, concluded that it is unequivocal that the increase of CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere over the industrial era is the result of human activities and that human influence is the principal driver of many changes observed across the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nThe panel's AR6 Working Group I (WGI) Summary for Policymakers report is online at https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/.\nScientists use a metric called Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) to measure the changes in energy the Earth receives from the Sun. TSI incorporates the 11-year solar cycle and solar flares/storms from the Sun's surface.\nStudies show that solar variability has played a role in past climate changes. For example, a decrease in solar activity coupled with increased volcanic activity helped trigger the Little Ice Age.\nBut several lines of evidence show that current global warming cannot be explained by changes in energy from the Sun:\n1.

A recent New York Times column seems to imply that renewable energy investments set back efforts to address climate change\u2014nothing could be further from the truth. What\u2019s more, renewable technologies can increasingly save customers money as they displace emissions from fossil fuels.\nWind and solar energy have experienced remarkable growth and huge cost improvements over the past decade with no signs of slowing down. Prices are declining rapidly, and renewable energy is becoming increasingly competitive with fossil fuels all around the country. In some places, new renewable energy is already cheaper than continuing to operate old, inefficient and dirty fossil fuel-fired or nuclear power plants.\nIn fact, the investment firm Lazard estimates that the cost of generating electricity from wind and solar has declined by 58 percent and 78 percent, respectively, since 2009. Those cost trends are expected to continue, and coupled with the recent extension of federal tax credits for renewable energy, wind and solar growth is widely expected to accelerate over the next several years, with capacity projected to double from 2015 levels by 2021. With careful planning, renewable energy and clean energy options like increased energy efficiency and storing energy for use later will help pave the way.\nIn the longer term, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Clean Power Plan to establish the first national limits on carbon pollution from power plants will continue to drive renewable energy growth. Wind and solar energy will play a central role in achieving the emissions cuts required, and carbon policies like the Clean Power Plan will be critical to ensuring that low-carbon resources are prioritized over higher-emitting power plants.\nIn addition to the climate benefits that they will help deliver, renewables already provide a wide range of market and public health benefits that far outweigh their costs. A recent report from the Department of Energy and Lawrence Berkeley National (LBNL) Laboratory found that renewable portfolio standards\u2014state policies that mandate that a specific amount of the state\u2019s electricity comes from renewables\u2014provide a wide range of economic, health, and climate benefits. The report concluded that in 2013 alone, renewable standards across the country saved customers up to $1.2 billion from reduced wholesale electric prices and $1.3 billion to $3.7 billion from lower natural gas prices (as a result of lower demand for natural gas across the power sector).\nThe non-market benefits of renewable energy also are considerable. The LBNL researchers estimated that renewables supported nearly 200,000 jobs, provided $5.2 billion worth of health benefits through improved air quality, and resulted in global climate benefits of $2.2 billion. At the same time, according to a separate report by DBL Investors, the top 10 leading renewable states experienced lower electricity price increases than the bottom 10 states between 2002 and 2013.\nThe United States must continue\u2014and accelerate\u2014its clean energy growth and the transition to a low-carbon electric grid. There will be technical challenges to completing this transformation, but study after study concludes that integrating high levels of renewables into our electric grid is achievable. This is also being demonstrated in practice, as many states are already incorporating wind and solar, including in Texas, where wind has now supplied over 45 percent of the state\u2019s total energy demand on multiple occasions, and in Iowa, as the state now generates 31 percent of its total annual power from wind.\nMuch is said about the need to adapt the electric grid to the variability associated with integrating renewable energy into our electricity mix. Until recently, the huge costs of maintaining back-up generation and transmission in case they\u2019re needed to keep the lights on when large, inflexible resources like coal and nuclear plants suddenly and unexpectedly go offline has too often been ignored. Grid managers and planners are now appropriately as concerned about the need for flexibility and predictability, assets that large fossil and nuclear plants lack. Renewable energy production is variable, but predictable (we mostly know when it will be sunny or windy). However, it can be impossible to predict when large fossil or nuclear plant will have to shut down for critical maintenance.\nIn a sign of the declining status of large, inflexible base load resources, PG&E recently announced it will close the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant in California and replace it with 100 percent clean energy (NRDC is a signatory), PG&E explains: \u201cCalifornia\u2019s electric grid is in the midst of a significant shift that creates challenges for the facility in the coming decades. Changes in state policies, the electric generation fleet, and market conditions combine to reduce the need for large, inflexible baseload power plants.\u201d\nAs we move forward, there are a number of grid planning practices and technologies that will help facilitate America\u2019s transition to higher and higher amounts of renewable energy. For example, as more and more cars on the road become electric, those vehicles can help store electricity and manage peak demand so that supply and demand can be better aligned. Demand response (compensating customers for altering their electricity use at specific periods) and time of use electricity pricing can provide similar support. Leading states are currently contemplating how to design policies and market structures that support a modernized, low-carbon grid. Planning for the future can and must be done in parallel with promoting strong renewables growth in the present.\nRenewable ener\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Over the last century, burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nHuman activities are driving the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century.\nScientists attribute the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century to the human expansion of the \"greenhouse effect\"1 \u2014 warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth toward space.\nLife on Earth depends on energy coming from the Sun. About half the light energy reaching Earth's atmosphere passes through the air and clouds to the surface, where it is absorbed and radiated in the form of infrared heat. About 90% of this heat is then absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-radiated, slowing heat loss to space.\nA vital component of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide (CO2) is released through natural processes (like volcanic eruptions) and through human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation.\nLike many atmospheric gases, methane comes from both natural and human-caused sources. Methane comes from plant-matter breakdown in wetlands and is also released from landfills and rice farming. Livestock animals emit methane from their digestion and manure. Leaks from fossil fuel production and transportation are another major source of methane, and natural gas is 70% to 90% methane.\nA potent greenhouse gas produced by farming practices, nitrous oxide is released during commercial and organic fertilizer production and use. Nitrous oxide also comes from burning fossil fuels and burning vegetation and has increased by 18% in the last 100 years.\nThese chemical compounds do not exist in nature \u2013 they are entirely of industrial origin. They were used as refrigerants, solvents (a substance that dissolves others), and spray can propellants.\nFORCING: Something acting upon Earth's climate that causes a change in how energy flows through it (such as long-lasting, heat-trapping gases - also known as greenhouse gases). These gases slow outgoing heat in the atmosphere and cause the planet to warm.\nWater vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas, but because the warming ocean increases the amount of it in our atmosphere, it is not a direct cause of climate change. Credit: John Fowler on Unsplash\nFEEDBACKS: A process where something is either amplified or reduced as time goes on, such as water vapor increasing as Earth warms leading to even more warming.\nOver the last century, burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). This increase happens because the coal or oil burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the air to make CO2. To a lesser extent, clearing of land for agriculture, industry, and other human activities has increased concentrations of greenhouse gases.\nThe industrial activities that our modern civilization depends upon have raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels by nearly 50% since 17502. This increase is due to human activities, because scientists can see a distinctive isotopic fingerprint in the atmosphere.\nIn its Sixth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, composed of scientific experts from countries all over the world, concluded that it is unequivocal that the increase of CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere over the industrial era is the result of human activities and that human influence is the principal driver of many changes observed across the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nThe panel's AR6 Working Group I (WGI) Summary for Policymakers report is online at https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/.\nScientists use a metric called Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) to measure the changes in energy the Earth receives from the Sun. TSI incorporates the 11-year solar cycle and solar flares/storms from the Sun's surface.\nStudies show that solar variability has played a role in past climate changes. For example, a decrease in solar activity coupled with increased volcanic activity helped trigger the Little Ice Age.\nBut several lines of evidence show that current global warming cannot be explained by changes in energy from the Sun:\n1.

Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly 10 times faster than the average rate of warming after an ice age. Carbon dioxide from human activities is increasing about 250 times faster than it did from natural sources after the last Ice Age.3\nThe planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and other human activities.4 Most of the warming occurred in the past 40 years, with the seven most recent years being the warmest.

Even if it\u2019s something you don\u2019t think about often, like air conditioning or refrigeration, you'd likely miss it if it were gone.\nMany products you use have hidden environmental costs, and some generate huge quantities of greenhouse gases. Every step in the life cycle of a product leaves a mark. Emissions can occur as raw materials are extracted and processed in factories, packaged, and then shipped. Even after you\u2019ve bought something, its harm to the climate could continue through the electricity it uses to operate, the power needed to run it through the wash, or the waste it generates once it's discarded.\nBut what exactly are greenhouse gases, and why do they have such a profound effect on Earth\u2019s climate? Understanding how greenhouse gases originate and how to measure their effects on the climate is crucial for tackling the biggest environmental challenge of our time. In this resource, you\u2019ll learn how everyday actions and choices can help or hurt our planet.\nHumans have dramatically changed the atmosphere over the past few centuries, mainly by releasing vast amounts of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2). That story begins in the 1700s with the Industrial Revolution, a time when human society began to change rapidly. Before that period, economies relied largely on agriculture.

Well, fossil fuels are formed from the remains of ancient plants and animals buried deep in the earth\u2014most of which are composed of carbon. Over millions of years, heat and pressure turned those remains into energy-rich substances.

About half the light energy reaching Earth's atmosphere passes through the air and clouds to the surface, where it is absorbed and radiated in the form of infrared heat. About 90% of this heat is then absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-radiated, slowing heat loss to space.\nA vital component of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide (CO2) is released through natural processes (like volcanic eruptions) and through human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation.\nLike many atmospheric gases, methane comes from both natural and human-caused sources. Methane comes from plant-matter breakdown in wetlands and is also released from landfills and rice farming. Livestock animals emit methane from their digestion and manure. Leaks from fossil fuel production and transportation are another major source of methane, and natural gas is 70% to 90% methane.\nA potent greenhouse gas produced by farming practices, nitrous oxide is released during commercial and organic fertilizer production and use. Nitrous oxide also comes from burning fossil fuels and burning vegetation and has increased by 18% in the last 100 years.\nThese chemical compounds do not exist in nature \u2013 they are entirely of industrial origin. They were used as refrigerants, solvents (a substance that dissolves others), and spray can propellants.\nFORCING: Something acting upon Earth's climate that causes a change in how energy flows through it (such as long-lasting, heat-trapping gases - also known as greenhouse gases). These gases slow outgoing heat in the atmosphere and cause the planet to warm.\nWater vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas, but because the warming ocean increases the amount of it in our atmosphere, it is not a direct cause of climate change. Credit: John Fowler on Unsplash\nFEEDBACKS: A process where something is either amplified or reduced as time goes on, such as water vapor increasing as Earth warms leading to even more warming.\nOver the last century, burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). This increase happens because the coal or oil burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the air to make CO2. To a lesser extent, clearing of land for agriculture, industry, and other human activities has increased concentrations of greenhouse gases.\nThe industrial activities that our modern civilization depends upon have raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels by nearly 50% since 17502. This increase is due to human activities, because scientists can see a distinctive isotopic fingerprint in the atmosphere.\nIn its Sixth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, composed of scientific experts from countries all over the world, concluded that it is unequivocal that the increase of CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere over the industrial era is the result of human activities and that human influence is the principal driver of many changes observed across the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nThe panel's AR6 Working Group I (WGI) Summary for Policymakers report is online at https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/.\nScientists use a metric called Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) to measure the changes in energy the Earth receives from the Sun. TSI incorporates the 11-year solar cycle and solar flares/storms from the Sun's surface.\nStudies show that solar variability has played a role in past climate changes. For example, a decrease in solar activity coupled with increased volcanic activity helped trigger the Little Ice Age.\nBut several lines of evidence show that current global warming cannot be explained by changes in energy from the Sun:\n1.

Human activity is the principal cause.\nEarth's climate has changed throughout history. Just in the last 800,000 years, there have been eight cycles of ice ages and warmer periods, with the end of the last ice age about 11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era \u2014 and of human civilization. Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth\u2019s orbit that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives.\nThe current warming trend is different because it is clearly the result of human activities since the mid-1800s, and is proceeding at a rate not seen over many recent millennia.1 It is undeniable that human activities have produced the atmospheric gases that have trapped more of the Sun\u2019s energy in the Earth system. This extra energy has warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land, and widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred.\nEarth-orbiting satellites and new technologies have helped scientists see the big picture, collecting many different types of information about our planet and its climate all over the world. These data, collected over many years, reveal the signs and patterns of a changing climate.\nScientists demonstrated the heat-trapping nature of carbon dioxide and other gases in the mid-19th century.2 Many of the science instruments NASA uses to study our climate focus on how these gases affect the movement of infrared radiation through the atmosphere. From the measured impacts of increases in these gases, there is no question that increased greenhouse gas levels warm Earth in response.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nIce cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that Earth\u2019s climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly 10 times faster than the average rate of warming after an ice age. Carbon dioxide from human activities is increasing about 250 times faster than it did from natural sources after the last Ice Age.3\nThe planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and other human activities.4 Most of the warming occurred in the past 40 years, with the seven most recent years being the warmest. The years 2016 and 2020 are tied for the warmest year on record.5 Image credit: Ashwin Kumar, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic.\nThe ocean has absorbed much of this increased heat, with the top 100 meters (about 328 feet) of ocean showing warming of 0.67 degrees Fahrenheit (0.33 degrees Celsius) since 1969.6 Earth stores 90% of the extra energy in the ocean. Image credit: Kelsey Roberts/USGS\nThe Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass. Data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment show Greenland lost an average of 279 billion tons of ice per year between 1993 and 2019, while Antarctica lost about 148 billion tons of ice per year.7 Image: The Antarctic Peninsula, Credit: NASA\nGlaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world \u2014 including in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska, and Africa.8 Image: Miles Glacier, Alaska Image credit: NASA\nSatellite observations reveal that the amount of spring snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere has decreased over the past five decades and the snow is melting earlier.9 Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\nGlobal sea level rose about 8 inches (20 centimeters) in the last century.

Understanding how greenhouse gases originate and how to measure their effects on the climate is crucial for tackling the biggest environmental challenge of our time. In this resource, you\u2019ll learn how everyday actions and choices can help or hurt our planet.\nHumans have dramatically changed the atmosphere over the past few centuries, mainly by releasing vast amounts of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2). That story begins in the 1700s with the Industrial Revolution, a time when human society began to change rapidly. Before that period, economies relied largely on agriculture. Most finished products were produced slowly and laboriously by skilled artisans. Human activity still produced greenhouse gases, but at much lower levels.\nEverything shifted when new manufacturing processes and machines, like the steam engine, arrived on the scene. To power growing industries, societies needed to burn fuel, and lots of it. Increasingly, that fuel came in the form of coal.\nA painting from 1855 of the Burmeister and Wain iron foundry in Copenhagen, Denmark.\nSource: Peder Severin Kroye via Statens Museum for Kunst\nCoal was a game changer because it was relatively packed with energy (around three times as much energy as the same amount of wood), and it was relatively easy to access. When burned, coal could efficiently power the new steam engines that drove factories, trains, and ships, allowing industries to grow like never before. Coal use set off a chain reaction: factories popped up everywhere, cities expanded, and people began moving in huge numbers to urban areas for work. That sparked the beginning of a global shift toward using fossil fuels\u2014coal, oil, and natural gas\u2014to power nearly every aspect of modern life.\nToday, those fuels are the backbone of modern society. However, burning fossil fuels releases CO2 into the atmosphere. How does that happen? Well, fossil fuels are formed from the remains of ancient plants and animals buried deep in the earth\u2014most of which are composed of carbon. Over millions of years, heat and pressure turned those remains into energy-rich substances. So, when people burn those fuels for energy, they are sending CO2, which was once trapped underground, into the atmosphere. The CO2 then traps heat from the sun in the atmosphere, making the earth warmer\u2014a process known as the greenhouse effect.\nAlthough fossil fuels are the main culprits, other human activity is driving climate change too. Cutting down forests and developing land has led to more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Also, as the world modernizes and grows wealthier, diets have changed, too. With more people able to afford meat, the demand for farm-raised animals like cows and sheep has soared. However, those animals release methane (CH4)\u2014a greenhouse gas even more potent than CO2\u2014during digestion. Plus, fertilizers that farmers use to grow more food releases nitrous oxide (N2O), another heat-trapping gas.\nCattle ranchers herd their cows in Miranda, Brazil in 2023.\nSource: Universal Images / Getty Images\nOn top of that, some newer technologies meant to improve human lives also contribute to the problem. Air conditioning and refrigeration, among other modern conveniences, rely on fluorinated gases to run. Those gases were designed as safer replacements for chemicals that damaged the ozone layer. However, they are extremely effective at trapping heat\u2014more than ten thousand times stronger than CO2. As those appliances have become more widespread, the use of fluorinated gases has surged.\nAlthough carbon dioxide is the most common greenhouse gas, it isn't the strongest at trapping heat. Gases like methane and nitrous oxide are much better at holding in heat from the sun. Some can linger in the atmosphere for a long time, making them even more powerful in warming the planet.\nFor each greenhouse gas, scientists calculate its global warming potential (GWP). That measure factors in how much heat a gas can trap and how long it stays in the atmosphere. The GWP score is essentially a comparison to carbon dioxide\u2019s role in global warming.\nDifferent human activities release different greenhouse gases in varying amounts. So, leaders need to consider the GWP of the gases their climate policies would regulate. If they are trying to keep the world from warming by more than a certain degree, they need to know which gases to limit by how much.\nHumans produce greenhouse gases through a wide range of activities. To help track them all, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) divides them up into five primary sectors: energy, industry, agriculture and land use, transportation, and buildings.\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at each of the categories.\nEnergy: The world depends on electricity for nearly everything\u2014charging devices, runni\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This has led ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nThere is unequivocal evidence that Earth is warming at an unprecedented rate. Human activity is the principal cause.\nEarth's climate has changed throughout history. Just in the last 800,000 years, there have been eight cycles of ice ages and warmer periods, with the end of the last ice age about 11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era \u2014 and of human civilization. Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth\u2019s orbit that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives.\nThe current warming trend is different because it is clearly the result of human activities since the mid-1800s, and is proceeding at a rate not seen over many recent millennia.1 It is undeniable that human activities have produced the atmospheric gases that have trapped more of the Sun\u2019s energy in the Earth system. This extra energy has warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land, and widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred.\nEarth-orbiting satellites and new technologies have helped scientists see the big picture, collecting many different types of information about our planet and its climate all over the world. These data, collected over many years, reveal the signs and patterns of a changing climate.\nScientists demonstrated the heat-trapping nature of carbon dioxide and other gases in the mid-19th century.2 Many of the science instruments NASA uses to study our climate focus on how these gases affect the movement of infrared radiation through the atmosphere. From the measured impacts of increases in these gases, there is no question that increased greenhouse gas levels warm Earth in response.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nIce cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that Earth\u2019s climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly 10 times faster than the average rate of warming after an ice age. Carbon dioxide from human activities is increasing about 250 times faster than it did from natural sources after the last Ice Age.3\nThe planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and other human activities.4 Most of the warming occurred in the past 40 years, with the seven most recent years being the warmest. The years 2016 and 2020 are tied for the warmest year on record.5 Image credit: Ashwin Kumar, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic.\nThe ocean has absorbed much of this increased heat, with the top 100 meters (about 328 feet) of ocean showing warming of 0.67 degrees Fahrenheit (0.33 degrees Celsius) since 1969.6 Earth stores 90% of the extra energy in the ocean. Image credit: Kelsey Roberts/USGS\nThe Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass. Data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment show Greenland lost an average of 279 billion tons of ice per year between 1993 and 2019, while Antarctica lost about 148 billion tons of ice per year.7 Image: The Antarctic Peninsula, Credit: NASA\nGlaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world \u2014 including in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska, and Africa.8 Image: Miles Glacier, Alaska Image credit: NASA\nSatellite observations reveal that the amount of spring snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere has decreased over the past five decades and the snow is melting earlier.9 Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\nGlobal sea level rose about 8 inches (20 centimeters) in the last century.

We lose Arctic sea ice at a rate of almost 13% per decade, and over the past 30 years, the oldest and thickest ice in the Arctic has declined by a stunning 95%.\nIf emissions continue to rise unchecked, the Arctic could be ice-free in the summer by 2040. But what happens in the Arctic does not stay in the Arctic. Sea ice loss has far-reaching effects around the world.\nSee how melting sea ice is already affecting us\n\u00a9 Elisabeth Kruger / WWF-US\n\u00a9 Elisabeth Kruger / WWF-US\nThe Arctic and Antarctic are the world\u2019s refrigerator. Since they are covered in white snow and ice that reflect heat back into space, they balance out other parts of the world that absorb heat. Less ice means less reflected heat, meaning more intense heatwaves worldwide. But it also means more extreme winters: as the polar jet stream\u2014a high-pressure wind that circles the Arctic region\u2014is destabilized by warmer air, it can dip south, bringing bitter cold with it.\nGlobal average sea level has risen by about 7\u20138 inches since 1900 and it\u2019s getting worse. Rising seas endanger coastal cities and small island nations by exacerbating coastal flooding and storm surge, making dangerous weather events even more so. Glacial melt of the Greenland ice sheet is a major predictor of future sea level rise; if it melts entirely, global sea levels could rise 20 feet.\nPolar vortexes, increased heat waves, and unpredictability of weather caused by ice loss are already causing significant damage to crops on which global food systems depend. This instability will continue to mean higher prices for you and growing crises for the world\u2019s most vulnerable.\nAs ice melts, new shipping routes open up in the Arctic. These routes will be tempting time-savers, but incredibly dangerous. Imagine more shipwrecks or oil spills like the Exxon-Valdez in areas that are inaccessible to rescue or clean-up crews.\nStand up, raise your voice, and demand urgent, meaningful, and concrete climate action to keep global temperature rise to 1.5C and help communities and wildlife adapt. There\u2019s still time to avoid many of the worst impacts of sea ice loss and climate change if we act now and we act together.\nTake Action\nWhen there\u2019s less sea ice, animals that depend on it for survival must adapt or perish. Loss of ice and melting permafrost spells trouble for polar bears, walruses, arctic foxes, snowy owls, reindeer, and many other species. As they are affected, so too are the other species that depend on them, in addition to people. Wildlife and people are coming into more frequent contact \u2013 and often conflict \u2013 as wildlife encroach on Arctic communities, looking for refuge as their sea ice habitat disappears.\nArctic ice and permafrost\u2014ground that is permanently frozen\u2014store large amounts of methane, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. When it thaws, that methane is released, increasing the rate of warming. This, in turn, causes more ice and permafrost to thaw or melt, releasing more methane, causing more melting. As we lose more ice more quickly and see more rapid permafrost melt, we will start seeing the worst climate change predictions come true.\nBut something can be done about climate change.\nLimiting the increase in global temperature is our best chance of securing a safer future for all, preventing even more damaging consequences than we\u2019ve already seen. By keeping the rise to 1.5 C (2.7 F) we can prevent the worst effects of climate change. But helping communities and wildlife adapt to changes already underway in the meantime is essential.\nTo deliver on these important goals, WWF works with local communities, governments and others around the world to significantly and quickly reduce emissions and to help people and nature prepare for the many impacts of a changing climate. For example, WWF is testing new on-the-ground projects to help at-risk species and local communities adapt.\nAuthor: Lorin Hancock\nLearn more\nDiscover\nSupport\nConnect\nWorld Wildlife Fund 1250 24th St NW Washington, DC 20037\nWorld Wildlife Fund Inc. is a nonprofit, tax-exempt charitable organization (tax ID number 52-1693387) under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.

Collectively ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nEmissions of several important greenhouse gases that result from human activity have increased substantially since large-scale industrialization began in the mid-1800s. Most of these human-caused (anthropogenic) greenhouse gas emissions were carbon dioxide (CO2) from burning fossil fuels.\nConcentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere are naturally regulated by many processes that are part of the global carbon cycle. The flux, or movement, of carbon between the atmosphere and the earth's land and oceans is dominated by natural processes such as plant photosynthesis. Although these natural processes can absorb some of the anthropogenic CO2 emissions produced each year, starting in about 1950, CO2 emissions began exceeding the capacity of these processes to absorb carbon.\nThis imbalance between greenhouse gas emissions and the ability for natural processes to absorb those emissions has resulted in a continued increase in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. Concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere in 2022 were about 1.5 times greater than the concentrations in 1850.\nClick to enlarge\nScientists know with virtual certainty that high levels of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere tend to warm the planet. In computer-based models, rising concentrations of greenhouse gases result in a rising average surface temperature of the earth over time. Rising temperatures may produce changes in precipitation patterns, storm severity, and sea level. Collectively, this phenomena is commonly referred to as climate change.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggests that the earth's climate warmed by an estimated 0.92 degrees Centigrade (1.66 degrees Fahrenheit) between 1880 and 2012 1 and that human activity is likely an important driving factor. The IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report (Chapter 3: Human Influence on the Climate System) states, \"It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land since pre-industrial times.\"\ndid you know\nIn 2022, fossil fuels were the source of about 83% of U.S. primary energy consumption, 93% of total U.S. CO2, and 74% of total gross U.S. greenhouse gas emissions resulting from human activity.2\nThe report further states, \"The likely range of human-induced warming in global-mean surface air temperature in 2010\u20132019 relative to 1850\u20131900 is 0.8\u00b0C\u20131.3\u00b0C.\" The IPCC concluded that the increasing concentration of the major greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide) \u201care unprecedented over at least the last 800,000 years.\u201d The IPCC ties this rise directly to human activity.\nLast updated: June 18, 2024.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

A ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nHuman activities are driving the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century.\nScientists attribute the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century to the human expansion of the \"greenhouse effect\"1 \u2014 warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth toward space.\nLife on Earth depends on energy coming from the Sun. About half the light energy reaching Earth's atmosphere passes through the air and clouds to the surface, where it is absorbed and radiated in the form of infrared heat. About 90% of this heat is then absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-radiated, slowing heat loss to space.\nA vital component of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide (CO2) is released through natural processes (like volcanic eruptions) and through human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation.\nLike many atmospheric gases, methane comes from both natural and human-caused sources. Methane comes from plant-matter breakdown in wetlands and is also released from landfills and rice farming. Livestock animals emit methane from their digestion and manure. Leaks from fossil fuel production and transportation are another major source of methane, and natural gas is 70% to 90% methane.\nA potent greenhouse gas produced by farming practices, nitrous oxide is released during commercial and organic fertilizer production and use. Nitrous oxide also comes from burning fossil fuels and burning vegetation and has increased by 18% in the last 100 years.\nThese chemical compounds do not exist in nature \u2013 they are entirely of industrial origin. They were used as refrigerants, solvents (a substance that dissolves others), and spray can propellants.\nFORCING: Something acting upon Earth's climate that causes a change in how energy flows through it (such as long-lasting, heat-trapping gases - also known as greenhouse gases). These gases slow outgoing heat in the atmosphere and cause the planet to warm.\nWater vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas, but because the warming ocean increases the amount of it in our atmosphere, it is not a direct cause of climate change. Credit: John Fowler on Unsplash\nFEEDBACKS: A process where something is either amplified or reduced as time goes on, such as water vapor increasing as Earth warms leading to even more warming.\nOver the last century, burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). This increase happens because the coal or oil burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the air to make CO2. To a lesser extent, clearing of land for agriculture, industry, and other human activities has increased concentrations of greenhouse gases.\nThe industrial activities that our modern civilization depends upon have raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels by nearly 50% since 17502. This increase is due to human activities, because scientists can see a distinctive isotopic fingerprint in the atmosphere.\nIn its Sixth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, composed of scientific experts from countries all over the world, concluded that it is unequivocal that the increase of CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere over the industrial era is the result of human activities and that human influence is the principal driver of many changes observed across the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nThe panel's AR6 Working Group I (WGI) Summary for Policymakers report is online at https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/.\nScientists use a metric called Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) to measure the changes in energy the Earth receives from the Sun. TSI incorporates the 11-year solar cycle and solar flares/storms from the Sun's surface.\nStudies show that solar variability has played a role in past climate changes. For example, a decrease in solar activity coupled with increased volcanic activity helped trigger the Little Ice Age.\nBut several lines of evidence show that current global warming cannot be explained by changes in energy from the Sun:\n1.

These data, collected over many years, reveal the signs and patterns of a changing climate.\nScientists demonstrated the heat-trapping nature of carbon dioxide and other gases in the mid-19th century.2 Many of the science instruments NASA uses to study our climate focus on how these gases affect the movement of infrared radiation through the atmosphere. From the measured impacts of increases in these gases, there is no question that increased greenhouse gas levels warm Earth in response.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nIce cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that Earth\u2019s climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly 10 times faster than the average rate of warming after an ice age. Carbon dioxide from human activities is increasing about 250 times faster than it did from natural sources after the last Ice Age.3\nThe planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and other human activities.4 Most of the warming occurred in the past 40 years, with the seven most recent years being the warmest. The years 2016 and 2020 are tied for the warmest year on record.5 Image credit: Ashwin Kumar, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic.\nThe ocean has absorbed much of this increased heat, with the top 100 meters (about 328 feet) of ocean showing warming of 0.67 degrees Fahrenheit (0.33 degrees Celsius) since 1969.6 Earth stores 90% of the extra energy in the ocean.

Data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment show Greenland lost an average of 279 billion tons of ice per year between 1993 and 2019, while Antarctica lost about 148 billion tons of ice per year.7 Image: The Antarctic Peninsula, Credit: NASA\nGlaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world \u2014 including in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska, and Africa.8 Image: Miles Glacier, Alaska Image credit: NASA\nSatellite observations reveal that the amount of spring snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere has decreased over the past five decades and the snow is melting earlier.9 Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\nGlobal sea level rose about 8 inches (20 centimeters) in the last century.

We lose Arctic sea ice at a rate of almost 13% per decade, and over the past 30 years, the oldest and thickest ice in the Arctic has declined by a stunning 95%.\nIf emissions continue to rise unchecked, the Arctic could be ice-free in the summer by 2040. But what happens in the Arctic does not stay in the Arctic. Sea ice loss has far-reaching effects around the world.\nSee how melting sea ice is already affecting us\n\u00a9 Elisabeth Kruger / WWF-US\n\u00a9 Elisabeth Kruger / WWF-US\nThe Arctic and Antarctic are the world\u2019s refrigerator. Since they are covered in white snow and ice that reflect heat back into space, they balance out other parts of the world that absorb heat. Less ice means less reflected heat, meaning more intense heatwaves worldwide. But it also means more extreme winters: as the polar jet stream\u2014a high-pressure wind that circles the Arctic region\u2014is destabilized by warmer air, it can dip south, bringing bitter cold with it.\nGlobal average sea level has risen by about 7\u20138 inches since 1900 and it\u2019s getting worse. Rising seas endanger coastal cities and small island nations by exacerbating coastal flooding and storm surge, making dangerous weather events even more so. Glacial melt of the Greenland ice sheet is a major predictor of future sea level rise; if it melts entirely, global sea levels could rise 20 feet.\nPolar vortexes, increased heat waves, and unpredictability of weather caused by ice loss are already causing significant damage to crops on which global food systems depend. This instability will continue to mean higher prices for you and growing crises for the world\u2019s most vulnerable.\nAs ice melts, new shipping routes open up in the Arctic. These routes will be tempting time-savers, but incredibly dangerous. Imagine more shipwrecks or oil spills like the Exxon-Valdez in areas that are inaccessible to rescue or clean-up crews.\nStand up, raise your voice, and demand urgent, meaningful, and concrete climate action to keep global temperature rise to 1.5C and help communities and wildlife adapt. There\u2019s still time to avoid many of the worst impacts of sea ice loss and climate change if we act now and we act together.\nTake Action\nWhen there\u2019s less sea ice, animals that depend on it for survival must adapt or perish. Loss of ice and melting permafrost spells trouble for polar bears, walruses, arctic foxes, snowy owls, reindeer, and many other species. As they are affected, so too are the other species that depend on them, in addition to people. Wildlife and people are coming into more frequent contact \u2013 and often conflict \u2013 as wildlife encroach on Arctic communities, looking for refuge as their sea ice habitat disappears.\nArctic ice and permafrost\u2014ground that is permanently frozen\u2014store large amounts of methane, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. When it thaws, that methane is released, increasing the rate of warming. This, in turn, causes more ice and permafrost to thaw or melt, releasing more methane, causing more melting. As we lose more ice more quickly and see more rapid permafrost melt, we will start seeing the worst climate change predictions come true.\nBut something can be done about climate change.\nLimiting the increase in global temperature is our best chance of securing a safer future for all, preventing even more damaging consequences than we\u2019ve already seen. By keeping the rise to 1.5 C (2.7 F) we can prevent the worst effects of climate change. But helping communities and wildlife adapt to changes already underway in the meantime is essential.\nTo deliver on these important goals, WWF works with local communities, governments and others around the world to significantly and quickly reduce emissions and to help people and nature prepare for the many impacts of a changing climate. For example, WWF is testing new on-the-ground projects to help at-risk species and local communities adapt.\nAuthor: Lorin Hancock\nLearn more\nDiscover\nSupport\nConnect\nWorld Wildlife Fund 1250 24th St NW Washington, DC 20037\nWorld Wildlife Fund Inc. is a nonprofit, tax-exempt charitable organization (tax ID number 52-1693387) under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.

Meltwater from Greenland might be expected to initiate a climate response that is distinct, and perhaps different from, that associated with Antarctic meltwater. Which one might elicit a greater climate response, and what mechanisms are involved? To explore these questions, we apply climate response functions (CRFs) to guide a series of meltwater-perturbation experiments using a fully coupled climate model. In both hemispheres, meltwater drives atmospheric cooling, sea ice expansion, and strengthened Hadley and Ferrel cells. Greenland meltwater induces a slowdown of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) and a cooling of the subsurface ocean in the northern high latitudes. Antarctic meltwater, instead, induces a slowdown of the Antarctic Bottom Water formation and a warming of the subsurface ocean around Antarctica. For melt rates up to 2000 Gt yr\u22121, the climate response is rather linear. However, as melt rates increase to 5000 Gt yr\u22121, the climate response becomes nonlinear. Due to a collapsed AMOC, the climate response is superlinear at high Greenland melt rates. Instead, the climate response is sublinear at high Antarctic melt rates, due to the halting of the northward expansion of Antarctic sea ice by warm surface waters. Finally, in the linear limit, we use CRFs and linear convolution theory to make projections of important climate parameters in response to meltwater scenarios, which suggest that Antarctic meltwater will become a major driver of climate change, dominating that of Greenland meltwater, as the current century proceeds.\nMelting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets is one of the most uncertain potential contributors to future climate change. In this study, we address the comparative role of Greenland and Antarctic meltwater in the climate system and explore the differing mechanisms at work in each hemisphere. We find that the climate response is linear for low melt rates but becomes nonlinear for high melt rates.

Recent observations have shown that these ice sheets are melting at an accelerating rate (Paolo et al. 2015; Rignot et al. 2019; Mouginot et al. 2019; Shepherd et al. 2018, 2020; King et al. 2020). Between the periods of 1992\u20132011 and 2012\u201317, the rate of ice-mass loss has risen from roughly 100 to 250 Gt yr\u22121 in Greenland (Shepherd et al. 2020) and from 75 Gt yr\u22121 to roughly 200 Gt yr\u22121 in Antarctica (Shepherd et al. 2018). Since the 1990s, their combined contribution to global-mean sea level has been 18 mm, of which 10 mm came from Greenland (Shepherd et al. 2020) and 8 mm from Antarctica (Shepherd et al. 2018). The Greenland ice mass loss is ice-sheet-wide owing to rapidly increasing surface melting and ice dynamical imbalances (King et al. 2020). The Antarctic ice sheet retreat is largely due to ice-shelf basal melt and iceberg calving in roughly equal magnitude along the periphery, primarily in the Amundsen\u2013Bellingshausen Sea sectors (West Antarctica), Wilkes Land (East Antarctica), and the West and Northeast Peninsula (Rignot et al. 2019). Twenty-first-century simulations of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets forced with time-evolving ocean and climate fields derived from a high-emissions scenario suggest that the projected melt rates would exceed 500 and 5000 Gt yr\u22121, respectively, by 2100, leading to a total sea level rise in excess of 250 mm with meltwater feedback (Golledge et al. 2019).\nMeltwater from Greenland and Antarctica contributes not only to sea level but also initiates climate change through its effect, for example, on sea ice extent and the ocean\u2019s overturning circulation. One might expect the impacts of Greenland meltwater to be different from that of Antarctic meltwater because they act in different hemispheres and perturb different parts of the climate system. For example, it is thought that Antarctic meltwater spreading to the proximal ocean initiates surface cooling and freshening trends across the Southern Ocean (Bronselaer et al. 2018; Rye et al. 2020). Enhanced basal melt of Antarctic ice shelves (Rignot et al. 2013; Depoorter et al. 2013; Adusumilli et al. 2020) can cause significant sea ice expansion by suppressing convective mixing and its associated vertical heat exchange (Hellmer 2004; Bintanja et al. 2013). Meltwater discharge along the Antarctic continental shelf tends to weaken the Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) formation and abyssal ocean overturning (Silvano et al. 2018; Lago and England 2019; Li et al. 2023). Meltwater discharge from Greenland, meanwhile, can reduce deep ocean ventilation via a slowdown in the formation rate of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) originating in the Nordic seas [Greenland\u2013Iceland\u2013Norwegian (GIN) Seas] (B\u00f6ning et al. 2016), and a slowdown of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC; Rahmstorf et al. 2015; Bakker et al. 2016).

Most of these human-caused (anthropogenic) greenhouse gas emissions were carbon dioxide (CO2) from burning fossil fuels.\nConcentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere are naturally regulated by many processes that are part of the global carbon cycle. The flux, or movement, of carbon between the atmosphere and the earth's land and oceans is dominated by natural processes such as plant photosynthesis. Although these natural processes can absorb some of the anthropogenic CO2 emissions produced each year, starting in about 1950, CO2 emissions began exceeding the capacity of these processes to absorb carbon.\nThis imbalance between greenhouse gas emissions and the ability for natural processes to absorb those emissions has resulted in a continued increase in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. Concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere in 2022 were about 1.5 times greater than the concentrations in 1850.\nClick to enlarge\nScientists know with virtual certainty that high levels of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere tend to warm the planet. In computer-based models, rising concentrations of greenhouse gases result in a rising average surface temperature of the earth over time. Rising temperatures may produce changes in precipitation patterns, storm severity, and sea level. Collectively, this phenomena is commonly referred to as climate change.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggests that the earth's climate warmed by an estimated 0.92 degrees Centigrade (1.66 degrees Fahrenheit) between 1880 and 2012 1 and that human activity is likely an important driving factor. The IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report (Chapter 3: Human Influence on the Climate System) states, \"It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land since pre-industrial times.\"\ndid you know\nIn 2022, fossil fuels were the source of about 83% of U.S. primary energy consumption, 93% of total U.S. CO2, and 74% of total gross U.S. greenhouse gas emissions resulting from human activity.2\nThe report further states, \"The likely range of human-induced warming in global-mean surface air temperature in 2010\u20132019 relative to 1850\u20131900 is 0.8\u00b0C\u20131.3\u00b0C.\" The IPCC concluded that the increasing concentration of the major greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide) \u201care unprecedented over at least the last 800,000 years.\u201d The IPCC ties this rise directly to human activity.\nLast updated: June 18, 2024.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Even if it\u2019s something you don\u2019t think about often, like air conditioning or refrigeration, you'd likely miss it if it were gone.\nMany products you use have hidden environmental costs, and some generate huge quantities of greenhouse gases. Every step in the life cycle of a product leaves a mark. Emissions can occur as raw materials are extracted and processed in factories, packaged, and then shipped. Even after you\u2019ve bought something, its harm to the climate could continue through the electricity it uses to operate, the power needed to run it through the wash, or the waste it generates once it's discarded.\nBut what exactly are greenhouse gases, and why do they have such a profound effect on Earth\u2019s climate? Understanding how greenhouse gases originate and how to measure their effects on the climate is crucial for tackling the biggest environmental challenge of our time. In this resource, you\u2019ll learn how everyday actions and choices can help or hurt our planet.\nHumans have dramatically changed the atmosphere over the past few centuries, mainly by releasing vast amounts of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2). That story begins in the 1700s with the Industrial Revolution, a time when human society began to change rapidly. Before that period, economies relied largely on agriculture. Most finished products were produced slowly and laboriously by skilled artisans. Human activity still produced greenhouse gases, but at much lower levels.\nEverything shifted when new manufacturing processes and machines, like the steam engine, arrived on the scene. To power growing industries, societies needed to burn fuel, and lots of it. Increasingly, that fuel came in the form of coal.\nA painting from 1855 of the Burmeister and Wain iron foundry in Copenhagen, Denmark.\nSource: Peder Severin Kroye via Statens Museum for Kunst\nCoal was a game changer because it was relatively packed with energy (around three times as much energy as the same amount of wood), and it was relatively easy to access. When burned, coal could efficiently power the new steam engines that drove factories, trains, and ships, allowing industries to grow like never before. Coal use set off a chain reaction: factories popped up everywhere, cities expanded, and people began moving in huge numbers to urban areas for work. That sparked the beginning of a global shift toward using fossil fuels\u2014coal, oil, and natural gas\u2014to power nearly every aspect of modern life.\nToday, those fuels are the backbone of modern society. However, burning fossil fuels releases CO2 into the atmosphere. How does that happen? Well, fossil fuels are formed from the remains of ancient plants and animals buried deep in the earth\u2014most of which are composed of carbon. Over millions of years, heat and pressure turned those remains into energy-rich substances. So, when people burn those fuels for energy, they are sending CO2, which was once trapped underground, into the atmosphere. The CO2 then traps heat from the sun in the atmosphere, making the earth warmer\u2014a process known as the greenhouse effect.\nAlthough fossil fuels are the main culprits, other human activity is driving climate change too. Cutting down forests and developing land has led to more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Also, as the world modernizes and grows wealthier, diets have changed, too. With more people able to afford meat, the demand for farm-raised animals like cows and sheep has soared. However, those animals release methane (CH4)\u2014a greenhouse gas even more potent than CO2\u2014during digestion. Plus, fertilizers that farmers use to grow more food releases nitrous oxide (N2O), another heat-trapping gas.\nCattle ranchers herd their cows in Miranda, Brazil in 2023.\nSource: Universal Images / Getty Images\nOn top of that, some newer technologies meant to improve human lives also contribute to the problem. Air conditioning and refrigeration, among other modern conveniences, rely on fluorinated gases to run. Those gases were designed as safer replacements for chemicals that damaged the ozone layer. However, they are extremely effective at trapping heat\u2014more than ten thousand times stronger than CO2. As those appliances have become more widespread, the use of fluorinated gases has surged.\nAlthough carbon dioxide is the most common greenhouse gas, it isn't the strongest at trapping heat. Gases like methane and nitrous oxide are much better at holding in heat from the sun. Some can linger in the atmosphere for a long time, making them even more powerful in warming the planet.\nFor each greenhouse gas, scientists calculate its global warming potential (GWP). That measure factors in how much heat a gas can trap and how long it stays in the atmosphere. The GWP score is essentially a comparison to carbon dioxide\u2019s role in global warming.\nDifferent human activities release different greenhouse gases in varying amounts. So, leaders need to consider the GWP of the gases their climate policies would regulate. If they are trying to keep the world from warming by more than a certain degree, they need to know which gases to limit by how much.\nHumans produce greenhouse gases through a wide range of activities. To help track them all, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) divides them up into five primary sectors: energy, industry, agriculture and land use, transportation, and buildings.\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at each of the categories.\nEnergy: The world depends on electricity for nearly everything\u2014charging devices, runni\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This section provides information on emissions and removals of the main greenhouse gases to and from the atmosphere. Click on a greenhouse gas below to learn about its emissions in more detail.\nAdditional compounds in the atmosphere including solid and liquid aerosol and other greenhouse gases, such as water vapor and ground-level ozone can also impact the climate. Learn more about these compounds and climate change on our Basics of Climate Change page.\nCarbon Dioxide Methane Nitrous Oxide Fluorinated Gases\nEach gas's effect on climate change depends on three main factors:\nVisit EPA\u2019s Basics of Climate Change page to learn more about the effect of greenhouse gases on the Earth\u2019s climate.\nConcentration, or abundance, is the amount of a particular gas in the air. Larger emissions of greenhouse gases lead to higher concentrations in the atmosphere. Greenhouse gas concentrations are measured in parts per million, parts per billion, and even parts per trillion. One part per million is equivalent to one drop of water diluted into about 13 gallons of liquid (roughly the fuel tank of a compact car). To learn more about the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, visit the Climate Change Indicators: Atmospheric Concentrations of Greenhouse Gases page.\nEach of these gases can remain in the atmosphere for different amounts of time, ranging from a few years to thousands of years. All these gases remain in the atmosphere long enough to become well mixed, meaning that the amount that is measured in the atmosphere is roughly the same all over the world, regardless of the source of the emissions.\nSome gases are more effective than others at making the planet warmer and \"thickening the Earth's atmospheric blanket.\"\nFor each greenhouse gas, a Global Warming Potential (GWP) was developed to allow comparisons of the global warming impacts of different gases. Specifically, it is a measure of how much energy the emissions of 1 ton of a gas will absorb over a given period of time, typically a 100-year time horizon, relative to the emissions of 1 ton of carbon dioxide (CO2). Gases with a higher GWP absorb more energy, per ton emitted, than gases with a lower GWP, and thus contribute more to warming Earth.\nNote: All emission estimates are sourced from the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990\u20132022. The Inventory uses 100-year GWPs from IPCC\u2019s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5).\nA million metric tons equals about 2.2 billion pounds, or 1 trillion grams. For comparison, a small car is likely to weigh a little more than 1 metric ton. Thus, a million metric tons is roughly the same mass as 1 million small cars!\nThe U.S. GHG Inventory uses metric units for consistency and comparability with other countries. For reference, a metric ton is slightly more (approximately 10%) than a U.S. \"short\" ton.\nGHG emissions are often measured in carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent. To convert emissions of a gas into CO2 equivalent, its emissions are multiplied by the gas's Global Warming Potential (GWP). The GWP takes into account the fact that many gases are more effective at warming Earth than CO2, per unit mass.\nThe GWP values appearing in the Overview of Greenhouse Gases and Sources of Greenhouse Gas web pages reflect the values used in the U.S. GHG Inventory, which are drawn from the IPCC\u2019s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5).

About half the light energy reaching Earth's atmosphere passes through the air and clouds to the surface, where it is absorbed and radiated in the form of infrared heat. About 90% of this heat is then absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-radiated, slowing heat loss to space.\nA vital component of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide (CO2) is released through natural processes (like volcanic eruptions) and through human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation.\nLike many atmospheric gases, methane comes from both natural and human-caused sources. Methane comes from plant-matter breakdown in wetlands and is also released from landfills and rice farming. Livestock animals emit methane from their digestion and manure. Leaks from fossil fuel production and transportation are another major source of methane, and natural gas is 70% to 90% methane.\nA potent greenhouse gas produced by farming practices, nitrous oxide is released during commercial and organic fertilizer production and use. Nitrous oxide also comes from burning fossil fuels and burning vegetation and has increased by 18% in the last 100 years.\nThese chemical compounds do not exist in nature \u2013 they are entirely of industrial origin. They were used as refrigerants, solvents (a substance that dissolves others), and spray can propellants.\nFORCING: Something acting upon Earth's climate that causes a change in how energy flows through it (such as long-lasting, heat-trapping gases - also known as greenhouse gases). These gases slow outgoing heat in the atmosphere and cause the planet to warm.\nWater vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas, but because the warming ocean increases the amount of it in our atmosphere, it is not a direct cause of climate change. Credit: John Fowler on Unsplash\nFEEDBACKS: A process where something is either amplified or reduced as time goes on, such as water vapor increasing as Earth warms leading to even more warming.\nOver the last century, burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). This increase happens because the coal or oil burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the air to make CO2. To a lesser extent, clearing of land for agriculture, industry, and other human activities has increased concentrations of greenhouse gases.\nThe industrial activities that our modern civilization depends upon have raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels by nearly 50% since 17502. This increase is due to human activities, because scientists can see a distinctive isotopic fingerprint in the atmosphere.\nIn its Sixth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, composed of scientific experts from countries all over the world, concluded that it is unequivocal that the increase of CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere over the industrial era is the result of human activities and that human influence is the principal driver of many changes observed across the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere.\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nThe panel's AR6 Working Group I (WGI) Summary for Policymakers report is online at https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/.\nScientists use a metric called Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) to measure the changes in energy the Earth receives from the Sun. TSI incorporates the 11-year solar cycle and solar flares/storms from the Sun's surface.\nStudies show that solar variability has played a role in past climate changes. For example, a decrease in solar activity coupled with increased volcanic activity helped trigger the Little Ice Age.\nBut several lines of evidence show that current global warming cannot be explained by changes in energy from the Sun:\n1.

Millions of residents of the South Coast Basin (which includes Los Angeles, Orange, and parts of San Bernardino and Riverside counties) breathe dirty air some one-third the days of the year.\nOzone levels here, or what most refer to as smog, are often twice the federal health standard. In 1995, the standard was exceeded on 98 days at one or more Basin locations, most frequently in the east San Gabriel Valley.\nWhat does all of this polluted air do to the body? The answer depends on the situation. How long a person is exposed to pollution, the type and concentration, the place, time and day, temperature, weather and more.\nBut one thing is certain: Smog is harmful to your health.\nLungs are ozone's primary target. Studies on animals show that ozone damages cells in the lung's airways, causing inflammation and swelling. It also reduces the respiratory system's ability to fight infection and remove foreign particles.\nOzone may pose a particular health threat to those who already suffer from respiratory problems such as asthma, emphysema and chronic bronchitis. About 10% of the basin's approximately 14 million residents fit into this category. Ozone may also pose a health threat to the young, elderly and cardiovascular patients.\nOzone affects healthy people as well. In 1990, the State Air Resources Board established a new health advisory level in response to mounting evidence that smog affects healthy, exercising adults at lower levels than previously believed. Now, a health advisory is issued at .15 parts per million (on the pollutant standards index) before a first stage smog alert is called when ozone levels reach .20 ppm.\nDuring a health advisory, everyone, including healthy adults and children are advised to avoid prolonged, vigorous outdoor exercise. Susceptible individuals, including those with heart or lung disease, should avoid outdoor activities until the advisory is cancelled.\nCurrently, the federal Environmental Protection Agency is reviewing the adequacy of the federal health standard for ozone and is considering tightening it.\n[Back to Top]\nThe sources of pollution include emissions from on-road vehicles, non-road vehicles like planes, ships and trains, industries, and even small businesses and households where polluting products are used.\nOzone, an invisible gas, is not emitted directly into the air, but forms when nitrogen oxides from fuel combustion and volatile organic gases from evaporated petroleum products react in the presence of sunshine. Ozone levels are highest during the warm months when there is strong sunshine, high temperatures and an inversion layer.\nNitrogen oxides are produced when fossil fuels are burned in motor vehicles, power plants, furnaces and turbines.\nCarbon monoxide is a by-product of combustion that comes almost entirely from motor vehicles.\nFine particulates, which are emitted directly as smoke and diesel soot and form in the air out of nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides, obscure visibility and can be inhaled deep into the lungs.\n[Back to Top]\nDuring the early years of World War II, Los Angeles residents began to realize the consequences of an increasingly industrialized area. Investigations began to determine the cause of resident's eye irritation, crop damage, severe reductions in visibility and the rapid deterioration of rubber products. \"Smog\" became a familiar word and everyday presence and scientists and medical personnel began to look at its effects on public health.\nIn the mid-1950s, the state of California's Public Health division started to step up its efforts to define the problem of how and where smog forms, as well as address the health concerns associated with exposure to smog. Ozone levels were reaching peaks of .68 parts per million, more than six times the federal health standard. Early efforts to study the health effects of exposure to air pollution focused on acute exposure episodes. Only recently have the long-term exposure effects been addressed.\nIn a 1956 survey sent out by the Los Angeles County Medical Association, physicians reported the following:\n94.7% recognized the existence of a \"smog complex\" involving eye irritation, irritation of the respiratory tract, chest pains, cough, shortness of breath, nausea and headache;\n56.1% have \"authenticated cases of individuals leaving this area solely because of smog\";\n43.3% have recommended that patients move from the area on account of the effect of smog on their health;\n86.7% have observed that patients with respiratory diseases are more susceptible to smog than healthy adults;\n68% believe that patients with cardiac diseases are more susceptible to smog than healthy adults;\n89.6% have noticed patients with allergies are more susceptible to smog than healthy adults; and\n81.3% believe that smog is a contributing factor to cancer of the lungs and air passages.\n[Back to Top]\nThere have been several episodes in history which illustrate the harmful effects of \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This graph shows the station's monthly average carbon dioxide measurements since 1958 in parts per million (ppm). The seasonal cycle of highs and lows (small peaks and valleys) is driven by Northern Hemisphere summer vegetation growth, which reduces atmospheric carbon dioxide, and winter decay, which increases it.

In May 2024, carbon dioxide hit just under 427 ppm\u2014a new record.

Together, these impacts cause atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to rise faster than normal.\nEven though the 2023-24 El Ni\u00f1o had waned by April, record high air temperatures and drought in all of 2024, similar to those during an El Nino, were likely drivers of the large increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide in 2024. In addition to other factors, large forest fires in both the Amazon and Canada contributed to the 2024 global increase.\nCarbon dioxide concentrations are rising mostly because of the fossil fuels that people have been burning for energy since the start of the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuels like coal and oil contain the carbon from millions of years of photosynthesis\u2014the process by which plants remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. We are returning that carbon to the atmosphere in just a few hundred years. Since the middle of the 20th century, annual emissions of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels have increased every decade, from close to 11 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year in the 1960s to an estimated 37.4 billion tons in 2024 according to the Global Carbon Budget 2024.\nThe amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (blue line) has increased along with human emissions (gray line) since the start of the Industrial Revolution in 1750. Emissions rose slowly to about 5 gigatons (1 gigaton is 1 billion metric tons per year) in the mid-20th century before rapidly increasing to more than 35 billion tons per year by the end of the century. NOAA Climate.gov graph, adapted from original by Dr. Howard Diamond (NOAA ARL). Atmospheric carbon dioxide data from NOAA and ETHZ. Carbon dioxide emissions data from Our World in Data and the Global Carbon Project.\nCarbon cycle experts estimate that natural \u201csinks,\u201d including plant growth and ocean absorption, remove about half of carbon dioxide humans emit into the atmosphere from fossil fuel burning. The rest stays in the atmosphere. Every year, we are adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than natural sinks can remove, and so the total amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere goes up. The bigger the overshoot, the faster atmospheric carbon dioxide increases.\nIn the 1960s, atmospheric carbon dioxide increased by about 0.8 ppm per year on average. That growth rate doubled to an average of 1.6 ppm per year in the 1980s and 1.5 ppm per year in the 1990s. In the last decade (2015-2024), the annual increase has accelerated to 2.6 ppm per year. As a result, the annual rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide over the past 60 years is 100-200 times faster than the increase that occurred at the end of the last ice age 11,000-17,000 years ago.\nCarbon dioxide is Earth\u2019s most important long-lived greenhouse gas: a gas that absorbs and radiates heat. Unlike oxygen or nitrogen (which make up most of Earth's atmosphere), greenhouse gases absorb heat radiating from the Earth\u2019s surface and re-release it in all directions\u2014including back toward Earth\u2019s surface. Without any carbon dioxide, Earth\u2019s natural greenhouse effect would be too weak to keep the average global surface temperature above freezing.\nBy adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, people are amplifying the natural greenhouse effect, causing global temperature to rise. According to observations and analysis by the NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory, carbon dioxide alone is responsible for about 80 percent of the total heating influence of all human-produced greenhouse gases since 1990.\nAnother reason carbon dioxide is important in the Earth system is that it dissolves into the ocean like the fizz in a can of soda. It reacts with water molecules, producing carbonic acid and lowering the ocean's pH (raising its acidity). Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, the pH of the ocean's surface waters has dropped from 8.21 to 8.10. This drop in pH is called ocean acidification, and it interferes with the ability of marine life to extract calcium from sea water to build skeletons and shells.\n(left) A healthy ocean snail has a transparent shell with smoothly contoured ridges.

This section provides information on emissions and removals of the main greenhouse gases to and from the atmosphere. Click on a greenhouse gas below to learn about its emissions in more detail.\nAdditional compounds in the atmosphere including solid and liquid aerosol and other greenhouse gases, such as water vapor and ground-level ozone can also impact the climate. Learn more about these compounds and climate change on our Basics of Climate Change page.\nCarbon Dioxide Methane Nitrous Oxide Fluorinated Gases\nEach gas's effect on climate change depends on three main factors:\nVisit EPA\u2019s Basics of Climate Change page to learn more about the effect of greenhouse gases on the Earth\u2019s climate.\nConcentration, or abundance, is the amount of a particular gas in the air. Larger emissions of greenhouse gases lead to higher concentrations in the atmosphere. Greenhouse gas concentrations are measured in parts per million, parts per billion, and even parts per trillion. One part per million is equivalent to one drop of water diluted into about 13 gallons of liquid (roughly the fuel tank of a compact car). To learn more about the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, visit the Climate Change Indicators: Atmospheric Concentrations of Greenhouse Gases page.\nEach of these gases can remain in the atmosphere for different amounts of time, ranging from a few years to thousands of years. All these gases remain in the atmosphere long enough to become well mixed, meaning that the amount that is measured in the atmosphere is roughly the same all over the world, regardless of the source of the emissions.\nSome gases are more effective than others at making the planet warmer and \"thickening the Earth's atmospheric blanket.\"\nFor each greenhouse gas, a Global Warming Potential (GWP) was developed to allow comparisons of the global warming impacts of different gases. Specifically, it is a measure of how much energy the emissions of 1 ton of a gas will absorb over a given period of time, typically a 100-year time horizon, relative to the emissions of 1 ton of carbon dioxide (CO2). Gases with a higher GWP absorb more energy, per ton emitted, than gases with a lower GWP, and thus contribute more to warming Earth.\nNote: All emission estimates are sourced from the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990\u20132022. The Inventory uses 100-year GWPs from IPCC\u2019s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5).\nA million metric tons equals about 2.2 billion pounds, or 1 trillion grams. For comparison, a small car is likely to weigh a little more than 1 metric ton. Thus, a million metric tons is roughly the same mass as 1 million small cars!\nThe U.S. GHG Inventory uses metric units for consistency and comparability with other countries. For reference, a metric ton is slightly more (approximately 10%) than a U.S. \"short\" ton.\nGHG emissions are often measured in carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent. To convert emissions of a gas into CO2 equivalent, its emissions are multiplied by the gas's Global Warming Potential (GWP). The GWP takes into account the fact that many gases are more effective at warming Earth than CO2, per unit mass.\nThe GWP values appearing in the Overview of Greenhouse Gases and Sources of Greenhouse Gas web pages reflect the values used in the U.S. GHG Inventory, which are drawn from the IPCC\u2019s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). For further discussion of GWPs and an estimate of GHG emissions using updated GWPs, see Annex 6 of the U.S. GHG Inventory and the IPCC's discussion on GWPs (pdf)Exit EPA\u2019s website.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere reached 427 ppm (0.0427%) on a molar basis in 2024, representing 3341 gigatonnes of CO2.[1] This is an increase of 50% since the start of the Industrial Revolution, up from 280 ppm during the 10,000 years prior to the mid-18th century.[2][3][4] The increase is due to human activity.[5]\nThe current increase in CO2 concentrations is primarily driven by the burning of fossil fuels.[6] Other significant human activities that emit CO2 include cement production, deforestation, and biomass burning. The increase in atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases such as methane increase the absorption and emission of infrared radiation by the atmosphere. This has led to a rise in average global temperature and ocean acidification. Another direct effect is the CO2 fertilization effect. The increase in atmospheric concentrations of CO2 causes a range of further effects of climate change on the environment and human living conditions.\nCarbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. It absorbs and emits infrared radiation at its two infrared-active vibrational frequencies. The two wavelengths are 4.26 \u03bcm (2,347 cm\u22121) (antisymmetric stretching vibrational mode) and 14.99 \u03bcm (667 cm\u22121) (bending vibrational mode). CO2 plays a significant role in influencing Earth's surface temperature through the greenhouse effect.[7] Light emission from the Earth's surface is most intense in the infrared region between 200 and 2500 cm\u22121,[8] as opposed to light emission from the much hotter Sun which is most intense in the visible region. Absorption of infrared light at the vibrational frequencies of atmospheric CO2 traps energy near the surface, warming the surface of Earth and its lower atmosphere. Less energy reaches the upper atmosphere, which is therefore cooler because of this absorption.[9]\nThe present atmospheric concentration of CO2 is the highest for 14 million years.[10] Concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere were as high as 4,000 ppm during the Cambrian period about 500 million years ago, and as low as 180 ppm during the Quaternary glaciation of the last two million years.[2] Reconstructed temperature records for the last 420 million years indicate that atmospheric CO2 concentrations peaked at approximately 2,000 ppm. This peak happened during the Devonian period (400 million years ago). Another peak occurred in the Triassic period (220\u2013200 million years ago).[11]\nSince the start of the Industrial Revolution, atmospheric CO2 concentration has been increasing, causing global warming and ocean acidification.[12] In October 2023 the average level of CO2 in Earth's atmosphere, adjusted for seasonal variation, was 422.17 parts per million by volume (ppm).[13] Figures are published monthly by the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).[14][15] The value had been about 280 ppm during the 10,000 years up to the mid-18th century.[2][3][4]\nEach part per million of CO2 in the atmosphere represents approximately 2.13 gigatonnes of carbon, or 7.82 gigatonnes of CO2.[16]\nIt was pointed out in 2021 that \"the current rates of increase of the concentration of the major greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide) are unprecedented over at least the last 800,000 years\".[17]: 515\nAs of 2024, it is estimated that 2,650 gigatonnes of CO2 have been emitted by human activity since 1850, with annual emissions of 42 gigatonnes per year. About 1,050 gigatonnes remain in the atmosphere following absorption by oceans and land.[18]\nSome fraction (a projected 20\u201335%) of the fossil carbon transferred thus far will persist in the atmosphere as elevated CO2 levels for many thousands of years after these carbon transfer activities begin to subside.[19][20]\nAtmospheric CO2 concentrations fluctuate slightly with the seasons, falling during the Northern Hemisphere spring and summer as plants consume the gas and rising during northern autumn and winter as plants go dormant or die and decay. The level drops by about 6 or 7 ppm (about 50 Gt) from May to September during the Northern Hemisphere's growing season, and then goes up by about 8 or 9 ppm. The Northern Hemisphere dominates the annual cycle of CO2 concentration because it has much greater land area and plant biomass in mid-latitudes (30-60 degrees) than the Southern Hemisphere. Concentrations reach a peak in May as the Northern Hemisphere spring greenup begins, and decline to a minimum in October, near the end of the growing season.[21][22]\nConcentrations also vary on a regional basis, most strongly near the ground with much smaller variations aloft. In urban areas concentrations are generally higher[23] and indoors they can reach 10 times background levels.\nThe concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are expressed as parts per million by volume (abbreviated as ppmv, or ppm(v), or just ppm). To convert from the usual ppmv units to ppm mass (abbreviated as ppmm, or ppm(m)), multiply by the ratio of the molar mass of CO2 to that of air, i.e. times 1.52 (44.01 divided by 28.96).\nThe first reproducibly accurate measurements of atmospheric CO2 were from flask sample measurements made by Dave Keeling at Caltech in the 1950s.[32] Measurements at Mauna Loa have been ongoing since 1958. Additionally, measurements are also made at many other sites around the world. Many measurement sites are part of larger global networks.

Millions of residents of the South Coast Basin (which includes Los Angeles, Orange, and parts of San Bernardino and Riverside counties) breathe dirty air some one-third the days of the year.\nOzone levels here, or what most refer to as smog, are often twice the federal health standard. In 1995, the standard was exceeded on 98 days at one or more Basin locations, most frequently in the east San Gabriel Valley.\nWhat does all of this polluted air do to the body? The answer depends on the situation. How long a person is exposed to pollution, the type and concentration, the place, time and day, temperature, weather and more.\nBut one thing is certain: Smog is harmful to your health.\nLungs are ozone's primary target. Studies on animals show that ozone damages cells in the lung's airways, causing inflammation and swelling. It also reduces the respiratory system's ability to fight infection and remove foreign particles.\nOzone may pose a particular health threat to those who already suffer from respiratory problems such as asthma, emphysema and chronic bronchitis. About 10% of the basin's approximately 14 million residents fit into this category. Ozone may also pose a health threat to the young, elderly and cardiovascular patients.\nOzone affects healthy people as well. In 1990, the State Air Resources Board established a new health advisory level in response to mounting evidence that smog affects healthy, exercising adults at lower levels than previously believed. Now, a health advisory is issued at .15 parts per million (on the pollutant standards index) before a first stage smog alert is called when ozone levels reach .20 ppm.\nDuring a health advisory, everyone, including healthy adults and children are advised to avoid prolonged, vigorous outdoor exercise. Susceptible individuals, including those with heart or lung disease, should avoid outdoor activities until the advisory is cancelled.\nCurrently, the federal Environmental Protection Agency is reviewing the adequacy of the federal health standard for ozone and is considering tightening it.\n[Back to Top]\nThe sources of pollution include emissions from on-road vehicles, non-road vehicles like planes, ships and trains, industries, and even small businesses and households where polluting products are used.\nOzone, an invisible gas, is not emitted directly into the air, but forms when nitrogen oxides from fuel combustion and volatile organic gases from evaporated petroleum products react in the presence of sunshine. Ozone levels are highest during the warm months when there is strong sunshine, high temperatures and an inversion layer.\nNitrogen oxides are produced when fossil fuels are burned in motor vehicles, power plants, furnaces and turbines.\nCarbon monoxide is a by-product of combustion that comes almost entirely from motor vehicles.\nFine particulates, which are emitted directly as smoke and diesel soot and form in the air out of nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides, obscure visibility and can be inhaled deep into the lungs.\n[Back to Top]\nDuring the early years of World War II, Los Angeles residents began to realize the consequences of an increasingly industrialized area. Investigations began to determine the cause of resident's eye irritation, crop damage, severe reductions in visibility and the rapid deterioration of rubber products. \"Smog\" became a familiar word and everyday presence and scientists and medical personnel began to look at its effects on public health.\nIn the mid-1950s, the state of California's Public Health division started to step up its efforts to define the problem of how and where smog forms, as well as address the health concerns associated with exposure to smog. Ozone levels were reaching peaks of .68 parts per million, more than six times the federal health standard. Early efforts to study the health effects of exposure to air pollution focused on acute exposure episodes. Only recently have the long-term exposure effects been addressed.\nIn a 1956 survey sent out by the Los Angeles County Medical Association, physicians reported the following:\n94.7% recognized the existence of a \"smog complex\" involving eye irritation, irritation of the respiratory tract, chest pains, cough, shortness of breath, nausea and headache;\n56.1% have \"authenticated cases of individuals leaving this area solely because of smog\";\n43.3% have recommended that patients move from the area on account of the effect of smog on their health;\n86.7% have observed that patients with respiratory diseases are more susceptible to smog than healthy adults;\n68% believe that patients with cardiac diseases are more susceptible to smog than healthy adults;\n89.6% have noticed patients with allergies are more susceptible to smog than healthy adults; and\n81.3% believe that smog is a contributing factor to cancer of the lungs and air passages.\n[Back to Top]\nThere have been several episodes in history which illustrate the harmful effects of \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Learn more about these compounds and climate change on our Basics of Climate Change page.\nCarbon Dioxide Methane Nitrous Oxide Fluorinated Gases\nEach gas's effect on climate change depends on three main factors:\nVisit EPA\u2019s Basics of Climate Change page to learn more about the effect of greenhouse gases on the Earth\u2019s climate.\nConcentration, or abundance, is the amount of a particular gas in the air. Larger emissions of greenhouse gases lead to higher concentrations in the atmosphere. Greenhouse gas concentrations are measured in parts per million, parts per billion, and even parts per trillion. One part per million is equivalent to one drop of water diluted into about 13 gallons of liquid (roughly the fuel tank of a compact car). To learn more about the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, visit the Climate Change Indicators: Atmospheric Concentrations of Greenhouse Gases page.\nEach of these gases can remain in the atmosphere for different amounts of time, ranging from a few years to thousands of years. All these gases remain in the atmosphere long enough to become well mixed, meaning that the amount that is measured in the atmosphere is roughly the same all over the world, regardless of the source of the emissions.\nSome gases are more effective than others at making the planet warmer and \"thickening the Earth's atmospheric blanket.\"\nFor each greenhouse gas, a Global Warming Potential (GWP) was developed to allow comparisons of the global warming impacts of different gases. Specifically, it is a measure of how much energy the emissions of 1 ton of a gas will absorb over a given period of time, typically a 100-year time horizon, relative to the emissions of 1 ton of carbon dioxide (CO2). Gases with a higher GWP absorb more energy, per ton emitted, than gases with a lower GWP, and thus contribute more to warming Earth.\nNote: All emission estimates are sourced from the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990\u20132022. The Inventory uses 100-year GWPs from IPCC\u2019s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5).\nA million metric tons equals about 2.2 billion pounds, or 1 trillion grams. For comparison, a small car is likely to weigh a little more than 1 metric ton. Thus, a million metric tons is roughly the same mass as 1 million small cars!\nThe U.S. GHG Inventory uses metric units for consistency and comparability with other countries. For reference, a metric ton is slightly more (approximately 10%) than a U.S. \"short\" ton.\nGHG emissions are often measured in carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent. To convert emissions of a gas into CO2 equivalent, its emissions are multiplied by the gas's Global Warming Potential (GWP). The GWP takes into account the fact that many gases are more effective at warming Earth than CO2, per unit mass.\nThe GWP values appearing in the Overview of Greenhouse Gases and Sources of Greenhouse Gas web pages reflect the values used in the U.S. GHG Inventory, which are drawn from the IPCC\u2019s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5).

Most of these human-caused (anthropogenic) greenhouse gas emissions were carbon dioxide (CO2) from burning fossil fuels.\nConcentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere are naturally regulated by many processes that are part of the global carbon cycle. The flux, or movement, of carbon between the atmosphere and the earth's land and oceans is dominated by natural processes such as plant photosynthesis. Although these natural processes can absorb some of the anthropogenic CO2 emissions produced each year, starting in about 1950, CO2 emissions began exceeding the capacity of these processes to absorb carbon.\nThis imbalance between greenhouse gas emissions and the ability for natural processes to absorb those emissions has resulted in a continued increase in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. Concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere in 2022 were about 1.5 times greater than the concentrations in 1850.\nClick to enlarge\nScientists know with virtual certainty that high levels of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere tend to warm the planet. In computer-based models, rising concentrations of greenhouse gases result in a rising average surface temperature of the earth over time. Rising temperatures may produce changes in precipitation patterns, storm severity, and sea level. Collectively, this phenomena is commonly referred to as climate change.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggests that the earth's climate warmed by an estimated 0.92 degrees Centigrade (1.66 degrees Fahrenheit) between 1880 and 2012 1 and that human activity is likely an important driving factor. The IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report (Chapter 3: Human Influence on the Climate System) states, \"It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land since pre-industrial times.\"\ndid you know\nIn 2022, fossil fuels were the source of about 83% of U.S. primary energy consumption, 93% of total U.S. CO2, and 74% of total gross U.S. greenhouse gas emissions resulting from human activity.2\nThe report further states, \"The likely range of human-induced warming in global-mean surface air temperature in 2010\u20132019 relative to 1850\u20131900 is 0.8\u00b0C\u20131.3\u00b0C.\" The IPCC concluded that the increasing concentration of the major greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide) \u201care unprecedented over at least the last 800,000 years.\u201d The IPCC ties this rise directly to human activity.\nLast updated: June 18, 2024.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This graph shows the station's monthly average carbon dioxide measurements since 1958 in parts per million (ppm). The seasonal cycle of highs and lows (small peaks and valleys) is driven by Northern Hemisphere summer vegetation growth, which reduces atmospheric carbon dioxide, and winter decay, which increases it. The long-term trend of rising carbon dioxide levels is driven by human activities. At Mauna Loa, the highest monthly value each year occurs in May. In May 2024, carbon dioxide hit just under 427 ppm\u2014a new record. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on Mauna Loa monthly mean data from NOAA Global Monitoring Lab.\nBased on the annual analysis from NOAA\u2019s Global Monitoring Lab, global average atmospheric carbon dioxide was 422.8 parts per million (\u201cppm,\u201d for short) in 2024, a new record high. The increase during 2024 was 3.75 ppm\u2014the largest one-year increase on record. At Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii (graph above), where the modern carbon dioxide record began in 1958, the annual average carbon dioxide in 2024 was 424.61 ppm, also a new record.\nThe years with the largest annual carbon dioxide growth tend to be associated with the strongest El Ni\u00f1os\u2014the warm phase of a natural climate pattern in the tropical Pacific\u2014which lead to high temperatures over land and sea and an expansion of global drought area. In turn, these weather conditions typically lead to less plant growth, which reduces carbon dioxide uptake, as well as increased decomposition of carbon in soil and increased carbon dioxide emissions from forest fires. Together, these impacts cause atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to rise faster than normal.\nEven though the 2023-24 El Ni\u00f1o had waned by April, record high air temperatures and drought in all of 2024, similar to those during an El Nino, were likely drivers of the large increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide in 2024. In addition to other factors, large forest fires in both the Amazon and Canada contributed to the 2024 global increase.\nCarbon dioxide concentrations are rising mostly because of the fossil fuels that people have been burning for energy since the start of the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuels like coal and oil contain the carbon from millions of years of photosynthesis\u2014the process by which plants remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. We are returning that carbon to the atmosphere in just a few hundred years. Since the middle of the 20th century, annual emissions of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels have increased every decade, from close to 11 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year in the 1960s to an estimated 37.4 billion tons in 2024 according to the Global Carbon Budget 2024.\nThe amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (blue line) has increased along with human emissions (gray line) since the start of the Industrial Revolution in 1750. Emissions rose slowly to about 5 gigatons (1 gigaton is 1 billion metric tons per year) in the mid-20th century before rapidly increasing to more than 35 billion tons per year by the end of the century. NOAA Climate.gov graph, adapted from original by Dr. Howard Diamond (NOAA ARL). Atmospheric carbon dioxide data from NOAA and ETHZ. Carbon dioxide emissions data from Our World in Data and the Global Carbon Project.\nCarbon cycle experts estimate that natural \u201csinks,\u201d including plant growth and ocean absorption, remove about half of carbon dioxide humans emit into the atmosphere from fossil fuel burning. The rest stays in the atmosphere. Every year, we are adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than natural sinks can remove, and so the total amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere goes up. The bigger the overshoot, the faster atmospheric carbon dioxide increases.\nIn the 1960s, atmospheric carbon dioxide increased by about 0.8 ppm per year on average. That growth rate doubled to an average of 1.6 ppm per year in the 1980s and 1.5 ppm per year in the 1990s. In the last decade (2015-2024), the annual increase has accelerated to 2.6 ppm per year. As a result, the annual rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide over the past 60 years is 100-200 times faster than the increase that occurred at the end of the last ice age 11,000-17,000 years ago.\nCarbon dioxide is Earth\u2019s most important long-lived greenhouse gas: a gas that absorbs and radiates heat. Unlike oxygen or nitrogen (which make up most of Earth's atmosphere), greenhouse gases absorb heat radiating from the Earth\u2019s surface and re-release it in all directions\u2014including back toward Earth\u2019s surface. Without any carbon dioxide, Earth\u2019s natural greenhouse effect would be too weak to keep the average global surface temperature above freezing.\nBy adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, people are amplifying the natural greenhouse effect, causing global temperature to rise. According to observations and analysis by the NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory, carbon dioxide alone is responsible for about 80 percent of the total heating influence of all human-produced greenhouse gases since 1990.\nAnother reason carbon dioxide is important in the Earth system is that it dissolves into the ocean like the fizz in a can of soda. It reacts with water molecules, producing carbonic acid and lowering the ocean's pH (raising its acidity). Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, the pH of the ocean's surface waters has dropped from 8.21 to 8.10. This drop in pH is called ocean acidification, and it interferes with the ability of marine life to extract calcium from sea water to build skeletons and shells.\n(left) A healthy ocean snail has a transparent shell with smoothly contoured ridges.

Millions of residents of the South Coast Basin (which includes Los Angeles, Orange, and parts of San Bernardino and Riverside counties) breathe dirty air some one-third the days of the year.\nOzone levels here, or what most refer to as smog, are often twice the federal health standard. In 1995, the standard was exceeded on 98 days at one or more Basin locations, most frequently in the east San Gabriel Valley.\nWhat does all of this polluted air do to the body? The answer depends on the situation. How long a person is exposed to pollution, the type and concentration, the place, time and day, temperature, weather and more.\nBut one thing is certain: Smog is harmful to your health.\nLungs are ozone's primary target. Studies on animals show that ozone damages cells in the lung's airways, causing inflammation and swelling. It also reduces the respiratory system's ability to fight infection and remove foreign particles.\nOzone may pose a particular health threat to those who already suffer from respiratory problems such as asthma, emphysema and chronic bronchitis. About 10% of the basin's approximately 14 million residents fit into this category. Ozone may also pose a health threat to the young, elderly and cardiovascular patients.\nOzone affects healthy people as well. In 1990, the State Air Resources Board established a new health advisory level in response to mounting evidence that smog affects healthy, exercising adults at lower levels than previously believed. Now, a health advisory is issued at .15 parts per million (on the pollutant standards index) before a first stage smog alert is called when ozone levels reach .20 ppm.\nDuring a health advisory, everyone, including healthy adults and children are advised to avoid prolonged, vigorous outdoor exercise. Susceptible individuals, including those with heart or lung disease, should avoid outdoor activities until the advisory is cancelled.\nCurrently, the federal Environmental Protection Agency is reviewing the adequacy of the federal health standard for ozone and is considering tightening it.\n[Back to Top]\nThe sources of pollution include emissions from on-road vehicles, non-road vehicles like planes, ships and trains, industries, and even small businesses and households where polluting products are used.\nOzone, an invisible gas, is not emitted directly into the air, but forms when nitrogen oxides from fuel combustion and volatile organic gases from evaporated petroleum products react in the presence of sunshine. Ozone levels are highest during the warm months when there is strong sunshine, high temperatures and an inversion layer.\nNitrogen oxides are produced when fossil fuels are burned in motor vehicles, power plants, furnaces and turbines.\nCarbon monoxide is a by-product of combustion that comes almost entirely from motor vehicles.\nFine particulates, which are emitted directly as smoke and diesel soot and form in the air out of nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides, obscure visibility and can be inhaled deep into the lungs.\n[Back to Top]\nDuring the early years of World War II, Los Angeles residents began to realize the consequences of an increasingly industrialized area. Investigations began to determine the cause of resident's eye irritation, crop damage, severe reductions in visibility and the rapid deterioration of rubber products. \"Smog\" became a familiar word and everyday presence and scientists and medical personnel began to look at its effects on public health.\nIn the mid-1950s, the state of California's Public Health division started to step up its efforts to define the problem of how and where smog forms, as well as address the health concerns associated with exposure to smog. Ozone levels were reaching peaks of .68 parts per million, more than six times the federal health standard. Early efforts to study the health effects of exposure to air pollution focused on acute exposure episodes. Only recently have the long-term exposure effects been addressed.\nIn a 1956 survey sent out by the Los Angeles County Medical Association, physicians reported the following:\n94.7% recognized the existence of a \"smog complex\" involving eye irritation, irritation of the respiratory tract, chest pains, cough, shortness of breath, nausea and headache;\n56.1% have \"authenticated cases of individuals leaving this area solely because of smog\";\n43.3% have recommended that patients move from the area on account of the effect of smog on their health;\n86.7% have observed that patients with respiratory diseases are more susceptible to smog than healthy adults;\n68% believe that patients with cardiac diseases are more susceptible to smog than healthy adults;\n89.6% have noticed patients with allergies are more susceptible to smog than healthy adults; and\n81.3% believe that smog is a contributing factor to cancer of the lungs and air passages.\n[Back to Top]\nThere have been several episodes in history which illustrate the harmful effects of \n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This peak ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nParticipate in the 2025 international science photo competition!\nIn the atmosphere of Earth, carbon dioxide is a trace gas that plays an integral part in the greenhouse effect, carbon cycle, photosynthesis, and oceanic carbon cycle. It is one of three main greenhouse gases in the atmosphere of Earth. The concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere reached 427 ppm (0.0427%) on a molar basis in 2024, representing 3341 gigatonnes of CO2.[1] This is an increase of 50% since the start of the Industrial Revolution, up from 280 ppm during the 10,000 years prior to the mid-18th century.[2][3][4] The increase is due to human activity.[5]\nThe current increase in CO2 concentrations is primarily driven by the burning of fossil fuels.[6] Other significant human activities that emit CO2 include cement production, deforestation, and biomass burning. The increase in atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases such as methane increase the absorption and emission of infrared radiation by the atmosphere. This has led to a rise in average global temperature and ocean acidification. Another direct effect is the CO2 fertilization effect. The increase in atmospheric concentrations of CO2 causes a range of further effects of climate change on the environment and human living conditions.\nCarbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. It absorbs and emits infrared radiation at its two infrared-active vibrational frequencies. The two wavelengths are 4.26 \u03bcm (2,347 cm\u22121) (antisymmetric stretching vibrational mode) and 14.99 \u03bcm (667 cm\u22121) (bending vibrational mode). CO2 plays a significant role in influencing Earth's surface temperature through the greenhouse effect.[7] Light emission from the Earth's surface is most intense in the infrared region between 200 and 2500 cm\u22121,[8] as opposed to light emission from the much hotter Sun which is most intense in the visible region. Absorption of infrared light at the vibrational frequencies of atmospheric CO2 traps energy near the surface, warming the surface of Earth and its lower atmosphere. Less energy reaches the upper atmosphere, which is therefore cooler because of this absorption.[9]\nThe present atmospheric concentration of CO2 is the highest for 14 million years.[10] Concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere were as high as 4,000 ppm during the Cambrian period about 500 million years ago, and as low as 180 ppm during the Quaternary glaciation of the last two million years.[2] Reconstructed temperature records for the last 420 million years indicate that atmospheric CO2 concentrations peaked at approximately 2,000 ppm. This peak happened during the Devonian period (400 million years ago). Another peak occurred in the Triassic period (220\u2013200 million years ago).[11]\nSince the start of the Industrial Revolution, atmospheric CO2 concentration has been increasing, causing global warming and ocean acidification.[12] In October 2023 the average level of CO2 in Earth's atmosphere, adjusted for seasonal variation, was 422.17 parts per million by volume (ppm).[13] Figures are published monthly by the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).[14][15] The value had been about 280 ppm during the 10,000 years up to the mid-18th century.[2][3][4]\nEach part per million of CO2 in the atmosphere represents approximately 2.13 gigatonnes of carbon, or 7.82 gigatonnes of CO2.[16]\nIt was pointed out in 2021 that \"the current rates of increase of the concentration of the major greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide) are unprecedented over at least the last 800,000 years\".[17]: 515\nAs of 2024, it is estimated that 2,650 gigatonnes of CO2 have been emitted by human activity since 1850, with annual emissions of 42 gigatonnes per year. About 1,050 gigatonnes remain in the atmosphere following absorption by oceans and land.[18]\nSome fraction (a projected 20\u201335%) of the fossil carbon transferred thus far will persist in the atmosphere as elevated CO2 levels for many thousands of years after these carbon transfer activities begin to subside.[19][20]\nAtmospheric CO2 concentrations fluctuate slightly with the seasons, falling during the Northern Hemisphere spring and summer as plants consume the gas and rising during northern autumn and winter as plants go dormant or die and decay. The level drops by about 6 or 7 ppm (about 50 Gt) from May to September during the Northern Hemisphere's growing season, and then goes up by about 8 or 9 ppm. The Northern Hemisphere dominates the annual cycle of CO2 concentration because it has much greater land area and plant biomass in mid-latitudes (30-60 degrees) than the Southern Hemisphere. Concentrations reach a peak in May as the Northern Hemisphere spring greenup begins, and decline to a minimum in October, near the end of the growing season.[21][22]\nConcentrations also vary on a regional basis, most strongly near the ground with much smaller variations aloft. In urban areas concentrations are generally higher[23] and indoors they can reach 10 times background levels.\nThe concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are expressed as parts per million by volume (abbreviated as ppmv, or ppm(v), or just ppm). To convert from the usual ppmv units to ppm mass (abbreviated as ppmm, or ppm(m)), multiply by the ratio of the molar mass of CO2 to that of air, i.e. times 1.52 (44.01 divided by 28.96).\nThe first reproducibly accurate measurements of atmospheric CO2 were from flask sample measurements made by Dave Keeling at Caltech in the 1950s.[32] Measurements at Mauna Loa have been ongoing since 1958. Additionally, measurements are also made at many other sites around the world. Many measurement sites are part of larger global networks. Global network data are often made publicly available.\nThere are several surface measurement (including flasks and continuous in situ) networks including NOAA/ERSL,[33] WDCGG,[34] and RAMCES.[35] The NOAA/ESRL Baseline Observatory Network, and the Scripps Institution of O\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Since carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, this increase has warmed the planet.\n430ppm\nJune 2025\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) is an important greenhouse gas. Greenhouse gases trap the heat from sunlight, warming the planet. Without any greenhouse gases, Earth would be too cold to support life. But the more greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere, the warmer the planet becomes.\nCarbon dioxide comes from sources such as the burning of fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, and natural gas), wildfires, and volcanic eruptions. The graph shows atmospheric CO2 levels measured by NOAA at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, since 1958. It's important to note that \u201cparts per million\u201d refers to the number of carbon dioxide molecules per million molecules of dry air. The data shown are the latest available, updated monthly.\nThe second animated graph shows CO2 levels from an Antarctic ice core in combination with the observations from Mauna Loa Observatory. This extends the record back through Earth\u2019s last three glacial cycles. The Antarctic ice core measures CO2 levels trapped in tiny air bubbles from the past that were preserved when the ice formed.\nGround-based and satellite measurements have measured a sharp increase in atmospheric CO2 in recent decades. With a more than 50% increase in CO2 since the start of industrial times in the 18th century, scientific measurements have linked this increase primarily to the burning of coal, oil, and gas. This means that CO2 levels are now 150% the value they were at in 1750 \u2014 this is at least 1.5 times greater than the natural increase observed at the end of the last ice age 20,000 years ago, which happened over thousands of years.\nThe animated map below shows the historical changes in global carbon dioxide over time. Note the colors change as the amount of CO2 rises from 365 parts per million (ppm) in 2002 to over 420 ppm in 2022. These measurements from the AIRS instrument come from the mid-troposphere, the layer of Earth's atmosphere that is 8 to 12 kilometers (about 5 to 7 miles) above the ground.\nA closer look at the carbon dioxide measurements at Mauna Loa shows a series of wiggles in the data. Although total CO2 is increasing each year, there is also a short-term cycle visible within the larger trend.\nThis annual rise and fall of CO2 levels is caused by seasonal cycles in photosynthesis on a global scale. In Northern Hemisphere spring, plants come to life and draw in CO2 to fuel their growth. This begins the process of lowering the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. In northern autumn, plant growth stops or slows down, and the whole process reverses itself. Much of the plant matter decomposes, releasing CO2 back to the atmosphere.\nA similar but less intense pattern repeats in the Southern Hemisphere in opposite seasons. Spring growth starts in September and winter decomposition begins in March, so CO2 records in the Southern Hemisphere show the opposite pattern of that seen in Mauna Loa. However, because there is a lot more land and vegetation in the Northern Hemisphere than the southern, the global yearly cycle more closely aligns with the northern seasons.\nSee the cycle in action in the visualization Watching Earth Breathe: The Seasonal Vegetation Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide.\nThis cycle of plant growth gives the graph of CO2 a sawtooth pattern of ups and downs from year to year. At a larger scale, the upward climb of the trend line over the decades is caused by CO2 emissions, primarily from burning fossil fuels. Thus, the data illustrate both natural factors and human additions of CO2.\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Meltwater from Greenland might be expected to initiate a climate response that is distinct, and perhaps different from, that associated with Antarctic meltwater. Which one might elicit a greater climate response, and what mechanisms are involved? To explore these questions, we apply climate response functions (CRFs) to guide a series of meltwater-perturbation experiments using a fully coupled climate model. In both hemispheres, meltwater drives atmospheric cooling, sea ice expansion, and strengthened Hadley and Ferrel cells. Greenland meltwater induces a slowdown of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) and a cooling of the subsurface ocean in the northern high latitudes. Antarctic meltwater, instead, induces a slowdown of the Antarctic Bottom Water formation and a warming of the subsurface ocean around Antarctica. For melt rates up to 2000 Gt yr\u22121, the climate response is rather linear. However, as melt rates increase to 5000 Gt yr\u22121, the climate response becomes nonlinear. Due to a collapsed AMOC, the climate response is superlinear at high Greenland melt rates. Instead, the climate response is sublinear at high Antarctic melt rates, due to the halting of the northward expansion of Antarctic sea ice by warm surface waters. Finally, in the linear limit, we use CRFs and linear convolution theory to make projections of important climate parameters in response to meltwater scenarios, which suggest that Antarctic meltwater will become a major driver of climate change, dominating that of Greenland meltwater, as the current century proceeds.\nMelting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets is one of the most uncertain potential contributors to future climate change. In this study, we address the comparative role of Greenland and Antarctic meltwater in the climate system and explore the differing mechanisms at work in each hemisphere. We find that the climate response is linear for low melt rates but becomes nonlinear for high melt rates. As the century proceeds, we speculate that Antarctic meltwater will increasingly dominate that of Greenland meltwater, leading to atmospheric cooling, Antarctic sea ice expansion, and contraction and warming of the Antarctic Bottom Water. Greenland meltwater will, instead, affect smaller changes in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\u00a9 2023 American Meteorological Society.

Recent observations have shown that these ice sheets are melting at an accelerating rate (Paolo et al. 2015; Rignot et al. 2019; Mouginot et al. 2019; Shepherd et al. 2018, 2020; King et al. 2020). Between the periods of 1992\u20132011 and 2012\u201317, the rate of ice-mass loss has risen from roughly 100 to 250 Gt yr\u22121 in Greenland (Shepherd et al. 2020) and from 75 Gt yr\u22121 to roughly 200 Gt yr\u22121 in Antarctica (Shepherd et al. 2018). Since the 1990s, their combined contribution to global-mean sea level has been 18 mm, of which 10 mm came from Greenland (Shepherd et al. 2020) and 8 mm from Antarctica (Shepherd et al. 2018). The Greenland ice mass loss is ice-sheet-wide owing to rapidly increasing surface melting and ice dynamical imbalances (King et al. 2020). The Antarctic ice sheet retreat is largely due to ice-shelf basal melt and iceberg calving in roughly equal magnitude along the periphery, primarily in the Amundsen\u2013Bellingshausen Sea sectors (West Antarctica), Wilkes Land (East Antarctica), and the West and Northeast Peninsula (Rignot et al. 2019). Twenty-first-century simulations of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets forced with time-evolving ocean and climate fields derived from a high-emissions scenario suggest that the projected melt rates would exceed 500 and 5000 Gt yr\u22121, respectively, by 2100, leading to a total sea level rise in excess of 250 mm with meltwater feedback (Golledge et al. 2019).\nMeltwater from Greenland and Antarctica contributes not only to sea level but also initiates climate change through its effect, for example, on sea ice extent and the ocean\u2019s overturning circulation. One might expect the impacts of Greenland meltwater to be different from that of Antarctic meltwater because they act in different hemispheres and perturb different parts of the climate system. For example, it is thought that Antarctic meltwater spreading to the proximal ocean initiates surface cooling and freshening trends across the Southern Ocean (Bronselaer et al. 2018; Rye et al. 2020). Enhanced basal melt of Antarctic ice shelves (Rignot et al. 2013; Depoorter et al. 2013; Adusumilli et al. 2020) can cause significant sea ice expansion by suppressing convective mixing and its associated vertical heat exchange (Hellmer 2004; Bintanja et al. 2013). Meltwater discharge along the Antarctic continental shelf tends to weaken the Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) formation and abyssal ocean overturning (Silvano et al. 2018; Lago and England 2019; Li et al. 2023). Meltwater discharge from Greenland, meanwhile, can reduce deep ocean ventilation via a slowdown in the formation rate of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) originating in the Nordic seas [Greenland\u2013Iceland\u2013Norwegian (GIN) Seas] (B\u00f6ning et al. 2016), and a slowdown of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC; Rahmstorf et al. 2015; Bakker et al. 2016). Antarctic meltwater can also affect the AMOC, but the sense of the change remains controversial. Stouffer et al. (2007) found that the AMOC remains unchanged or slightly weakened due to Antarctic meltwater spreading across the sea surface i\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This graph shows the station's monthly average carbon dioxide measurements since 1958 in parts per million (ppm). The seasonal cycle of highs and lows (small peaks and valleys) is driven by Northern Hemisphere summer vegetation growth, which reduces atmospheric carbon dioxide, and winter decay, which increases it.

The increase during 2024 was 3.75 ppm\u2014the largest one-year increase on record. At Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii (graph above), where the modern carbon dioxide record began in 1958, the annual average carbon dioxide in 2024 was 424.61 ppm, also a new record.\nThe years with the largest annual carbon dioxide growth tend to be associated with the strongest El Ni\u00f1os\u2014the warm phase of a natural climate pattern in the tropical Pacific\u2014which lead to high temperatures over land and sea and an expansion of global drought area. In turn, these weather conditions typically lead to less plant growth, which reduces carbon dioxide uptake, as well as increased decomposition of carbon in soil and increased carbon dioxide emissions from forest fires. Together, these impacts cause atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to rise faster than normal.\nEven though the 2023-24 El Ni\u00f1o had waned by April, record high air temperatures and drought in all of 2024, similar to those during an El Nino, were likely drivers of the large increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide in 2024. In addition to other factors, large forest fires in both the Amazon and Canada contributed to the 2024 global increase.\nCarbon dioxide concentrations are rising mostly because of the fossil fuels that people have been burning for energy since the start of the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuels like coal and oil contain the carbon from millions of years of photosynthesis\u2014the process by which plants remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. We are returning that carbon to the atmosphere in just a few hundred years. Since the middle of the 20th century, annual emissions of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels have increased every decade, from close to 11 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year in the 1960s to an estimated 37.4 billion tons in 2024 according to the Global Carbon Budget 2024.\nThe amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (blue line) has increased along with human emissions (gray line) since the start of the Industrial Revolution in 1750. Emissions rose slowly to about 5 gigatons (1 gigaton is 1 billion metric tons per year) in the mid-20th century before rapidly increasing to more than 35 billion tons per year by the end of the century.

Carbon dioxide emissions data from Our World in Data and the Global Carbon Project.\nCarbon cycle experts estimate that natural \u201csinks,\u201d including plant growth and ocean absorption, remove about half of carbon dioxide humans emit into the atmosphere from fossil fuel burning. The rest stays in the atmosphere. Every year, we are adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than natural sinks can remove, and so the total amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere goes up. The bigger the overshoot, the faster atmospheric carbon dioxide increases.\nIn the 1960s, atmospheric carbon dioxide increased by about 0.8 ppm per year on average. That growth rate doubled to an average of 1.6 ppm per year in the 1980s and 1.5 ppm per year in the 1990s. In the last decade (2015-2024), the annual increase has accelerated to 2.6 ppm per year. As a result, the annual rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide over the past 60 years is 100-200 times faster than the increase that occurred at the end of the last ice age 11,000-17,000 years ago.\nCarbon dioxide is Earth\u2019s most important long-lived greenhouse gas: a gas that absorbs and radiates heat. Unlike oxygen or nitrogen (which make up most of Earth's atmosphere), greenhouse gases absorb heat radiating from the Earth\u2019s surface and re-release it in all directions\u2014including back toward Earth\u2019s surface. Without any carbon dioxide, Earth\u2019s natural greenhouse effect would be too weak to keep the average global surface temperature above freezing.\nBy adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, people are amplifying the natural greenhouse effect, causing global temperature to rise. According to observations and analysis by the NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory, carbon dioxide alone is responsible for about 80 percent of the total heating influence of all human-produced greenhouse gases since 1990.\nAnother reason carbon dioxide is important in the Earth system is that it dissolves into the ocean like the fizz in a can of soda. It reacts with water molecules, producing carbonic acid and lowering the ocean's pH (raising its acidity). Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, the pH of the ocean's surface waters has dropped from 8.21 to 8.10. This drop in pH is called ocean acidification, and it interferes with the ability of marine life to extract calcium from sea water to build skeletons and shells.\n(left) A healthy ocean snail has a transparent shell with smoothly contoured ridges.

It is one of three main greenhouse gases in the atmosphere of Earth. The concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere reached 427 ppm (0.0427%) on a molar basis in 2024, representing 3341 gigatonnes of CO2.[1] This is an increase of 50% since the start of the Industrial Revolution, up from 280 ppm during the 10,000 years prior to the mid-18th century.[2][3][4] The increase is due to human activity.[5]\nThe current increase in CO2 concentrations is primarily driven by the burning of fossil fuels.[6] Other significant human activities that emit CO2 include cement production, deforestation, and biomass burning. The increase in atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases such as methane increase the absorption and emission of infrared radiation by the atmosphere. This has led to a rise in average global temperature and ocean acidification. Another direct effect is the CO2 fertilization effect. The increase in atmospheric concentrations of CO2 causes a range of further effects of climate change on the environment and human living conditions.\nCarbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. It absorbs and emits infrared radiation at its two infrared-active vibrational frequencies. The two wavelengths are 4.26 \u03bcm (2,347 cm\u22121) (antisymmetric stretching vibrational mode) and 14.99 \u03bcm (667 cm\u22121) (bending vibrational mode). CO2 plays a significant role in influencing Earth's surface temperature through the greenhouse effect.[7] Light emission from the Earth's surface is most intense in the infrared region between 200 and 2500 cm\u22121,[8] as opposed to light emission from the much hotter Sun which is most intense in the visible region. Absorption of infrared light at the vibrational frequencies of atmospheric CO2 traps energy near the surface, warming the surface of Earth and its lower atmosphere. Less energy reaches the upper atmosphere, which is therefore cooler because of this absorption.[9]\nThe present atmospheric concentration of CO2 is the highest for 14 million years.[10] Concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere were as high as 4,000 ppm during the Cambrian period about 500 million years ago, and as low as 180 ppm during the Quaternary glaciation of the last two million years.[2] Reconstructed temperature records for the last 420 million years indicate that atmospheric CO2 concentrations peaked at approximately 2,000 ppm. This peak happened during the Devonian period (400 million years ago). Another peak occurred in the Triassic period (220\u2013200 million years ago).[11]\nSince the start of the Industrial Revolution, atmospheric CO2 concentration has been increasing, causing global warming and ocean acidification.[12] In October 2023 the average level of CO2 in Earth's atmosphere, adjusted for seasonal variation, was 422.17 parts per million by volume (ppm).[13] Figures are published monthly by the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).[14][15] The value had been about 280 ppm during the 10,000 years up to the mid-18th century.[2][3][4]\nEach part per million of CO2 in the atmosphere represents approximately 2.13 gigatonnes of carbon, or 7.82 gigatonnes of CO2.[16]\nIt was pointed out in 2021 that \"the current rates of increase of the concentration of the major greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide) are unprecedented over at least the last 800,000 years\".[17]: 515\nAs of 2024, it is estimated that 2,650 gigatonnes of CO2 have been emitted by human activity since 1850, with annual emissions of 42 gigatonnes per year. About 1,050 gigatonnes remain in the atmosphere following absorption by oceans and land.[18]\nSome fraction (a projected 20\u201335%) of the fossil carbon transferred thus far will persist in the atmosphere as elevated CO2 levels for many thousands of years after these carbon transfer activities begin to subside.[19][20]\nAtmospheric CO2 concentrations fluctuate slightly with the seasons, falling during the Northern Hemisphere spring and summer as plants consume the gas and rising during northern autumn and winter as plants go dormant or die and decay. The level drops by about 6 or 7 ppm (about 50 Gt) from May to September during the Northern Hemisphere's growing season, and then goes up by about 8 or 9 ppm. The Northern Hemisphere dominates the annual cycle of CO2 concentration because it has much greater land area and plant biomass in mid-latitudes (30-60 degrees) than the Southern Hemisphere. Concentrations reach a peak in May as the Northern Hemisphere spring greenup begins, and decline to a minimum in October, near the end of the growing season.[21][22]\nConcentrations also vary on a regional basis, most strongly near the ground with much smaller variations aloft. In urban areas concentrations are generally higher[23] and indoors they can reach 10 times background levels.\nThe concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are expressed as parts per million by volume (abbreviated as ppmv, or ppm(v), or just ppm). To convert from the usual ppmv units to ppm mass (abbreviated as ppmm, or ppm(m)), multiply by the ratio of the molar mass of CO2 to that of air, i.e. times 1.52 (44.01 divided by 28.96).\nThe first reproducibly accurate measurements of atmospheric CO2 were from flask sample measurements made by Dave Keeling at Caltech in the 1950s.[32] Measurements at Mauna Loa have been ongoing since 1958. Additionally, measurements are also made at many other sites around the world. Many measurement sites are part of larger global networks. Global network data are often made publicly available.\nThere are several surface measurement (including flasks and continuous in situ) networks including NOAA/ERSL,[33] WDCGG,[34] and RAMCES.[35] The NOAA/ESRL Baseline Observatory Network, and the Scripps Institution of O\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Even if it\u2019s something you don\u2019t think about often, like air conditioning or refrigeration, you'd likely miss it if it were gone.\nMany products you use have hidden environmental costs, and some generate huge quantities of greenhouse gases. Every step in the life cycle of a product leaves a mark. Emissions can occur as raw materials are extracted and processed in factories, packaged, and then shipped. Even after you\u2019ve bought something, its harm to the climate could continue through the electricity it uses to operate, the power needed to run it through the wash, or the waste it generates once it's discarded.\nBut what exactly are greenhouse gases, and why do they have such a profound effect on Earth\u2019s climate? Understanding how greenhouse gases originate and how to measure their effects on the climate is crucial for tackling the biggest environmental challenge of our time. In this resource, you\u2019ll learn how everyday actions and choices can help or hurt our planet.\nHumans have dramatically changed the atmosphere over the past few centuries, mainly by releasing vast amounts of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2). That story begins in the 1700s with the Industrial Revolution, a time when human society began to change rapidly. Before that period, economies relied largely on agriculture. Most finished products were produced slowly and laboriously by skilled artisans. Human activity still produced greenhouse gases, but at much lower levels.\nEverything shifted when new manufacturing processes and machines, like the steam engine, arrived on the scene. To power growing industries, societies needed to burn fuel, and lots of it. Increasingly, that fuel came in the form of coal.\nA painting from 1855 of the Burmeister and Wain iron foundry in Copenhagen, Denmark.\nSource: Peder Severin Kroye via Statens Museum for Kunst\nCoal was a game changer because it was relatively packed with energy (around three times as much energy as the same amount of wood), and it was relatively easy to access. When burned, coal could efficiently power the new steam engines that drove factories, trains, and ships, allowing industries to grow like never before. Coal use set off a chain reaction: factories popped up everywhere, cities expanded, and people began moving in huge numbers to urban areas for work. That sparked the beginning of a global shift toward using fossil fuels\u2014coal, oil, and natural gas\u2014to power nearly every aspect of modern life.\nToday, those fuels are the backbone of modern society. However, burning fossil fuels releases CO2 into the atmosphere. How does that happen? Well, fossil fuels are formed from the remains of ancient plants and animals buried deep in the earth\u2014most of which are composed of carbon. Over millions of years, heat and pressure turned those remains into energy-rich substances. So, when people burn those fuels for energy, they are sending CO2, which was once trapped underground, into the atmosphere. The CO2 then traps heat from the sun in the atmosphere, making the earth warmer\u2014a process known as the greenhouse effect.\nAlthough fossil fuels are the main culprits, other human activity is driving climate change too. Cutting down forests and developing land has led to more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Also, as the world modernizes and grows wealthier, diets have changed, too. With more people able to afford meat, the demand for farm-raised animals like cows and sheep has soared. However, those animals release methane (CH4)\u2014a greenhouse gas even more potent than CO2\u2014during digestion. Plus, fertilizers that farmers use to grow more food releases nitrous oxide (N2O), another heat-trapping gas.\nCattle ranchers herd their cows in Miranda, Brazil in 2023.\nSource: Universal Images / Getty Images\nOn top of that, some newer technologies meant to improve human lives also contribute to the problem. Air conditioning and refrigeration, among other modern conveniences, rely on fluorinated gases to run. Those gases were designed as safer replacements for chemicals that damaged the ozone layer. However, they are extremely effective at trapping heat\u2014more than ten thousand times stronger than CO2. As those appliances have become more widespread, the use of fluorinated gases has surged.\nAlthough carbon dioxide is the most common greenhouse gas, it isn't the strongest at trapping heat. Gases like methane and nitrous oxide are much better at holding in heat from the sun. Some can linger in the atmosphere for a long time, making them even more powerful in warming the planet.\nFor each greenhouse gas, scientists calculate its global warming potential (GWP). That measure factors in how much heat a gas can trap and how long it stays in the atmosphere. The GWP score is essentially a comparison to carbon dioxide\u2019s role in global warming.\nDifferent human activities release different greenhouse gases in varying amounts. So, leaders need to consider the GWP of the gases their climate policies would regulate. If they are trying to keep the world from warming by more than a certain degree, they need to know which gases to limit by how much.\nHumans produce greenhouse gases through a wide range of activities. To help track them all, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) divides them up into five primary sectors: energy, industry, agriculture and land use, transportation, and buildings.\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at each of the categories.\nEnergy: The world depends on electricity for nearly everything\u2014charging devices, runni\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Content is not being updated or maintained, and some links may no longer work.\nThe modern record of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels began with observations recorded at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. This graph shows the station's monthly average carbon dioxide measurements since 1958 in parts per million (ppm). The seasonal cycle of highs and lows (small peaks and valleys) is driven by Northern Hemisphere summer vegetation growth, which reduces atmospheric carbon dioxide, and winter decay, which increases it. The long-term trend of rising carbon dioxide levels is driven by human activities. At Mauna Loa, the highest monthly value each year occurs in May. In May 2024, carbon dioxide hit just under 427 ppm\u2014a new record. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on Mauna Loa monthly mean data from NOAA Global Monitoring Lab.\nBased on the annual analysis from NOAA\u2019s Global Monitoring Lab, global average atmospheric carbon dioxide was 422.8 parts per million (\u201cppm,\u201d for short) in 2024, a new record high. The increase during 2024 was 3.75 ppm\u2014the largest one-year increase on record. At Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii (graph above), where the modern carbon dioxide record began in 1958, the annual average carbon dioxide in 2024 was 424.61 ppm, also a new record.\nThe years with the largest annual carbon dioxide growth tend to be associated with the strongest El Ni\u00f1os\u2014the warm phase of a natural climate pattern in the tropical Pacific\u2014which lead to high temperatures over land and sea and an expansion of global drought area. In turn, these weather conditions typically lead to less plant growth, which reduces carbon dioxide uptake, as well as increased decomposition of carbon in soil and increased carbon dioxide emissions from forest fires. Together, these impacts cause atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to rise faster than normal.\nEven though the 2023-24 El Ni\u00f1o had waned by April, record high air temperatures and drought in all of 2024, similar to those during an El Nino, were likely drivers of the large increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide in 2024. In addition to other factors, large forest fires in both the Amazon and Canada contributed to the 2024 global increase.\nCarbon dioxide concentrations are rising mostly because of the fossil fuels that people have been burning for energy since the start of the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuels like coal and oil contain the carbon from millions of years of photosynthesis\u2014the process by which plants remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. We are returning that carbon to the atmosphere in just a few hundred years. Since the middle of the 20th century, annual emissions of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels have increased every decade, from close to 11 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year in the 1960s to an estimated 37.4 billion tons in 2024 according to the Global Carbon Budget 2024.\nThe amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (blue line) has increased along with human emissions (gray line) since the start of the Industrial Revolution in 1750. Emissions rose slowly to about 5 gigatons (1 gigaton is 1 billion metric tons per year) in the mid-20th century before rapidly increasing to more than 35 billion tons per year by the end of the century. NOAA Climate.gov graph, adapted from original by Dr. Howard Diamond (NOAA ARL). Atmospheric carbon dioxide data from NOAA and ETHZ. Carbon dioxide emissions data from Our World in Data and the Global Carbon Project.\nCarbon cycle experts estimate that natural \u201csinks,\u201d including plant growth and ocean absorption, remove about half of carbon dioxide humans emit into the atmosphere from fossil fuel burning. The rest stays in the atmosphere. Every year, we are adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than natural sinks can remove, and so the total amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere goes up. The bigger the overshoot, the faster atmospheric carbon dioxide increases.\nIn the 1960s, atmospheric carbon dioxide increased by about 0.8 ppm per year on average. That growth rate doubled to an average of 1.6 ppm per year in the 1980s and 1.5 ppm per year in the 1990s. In the last decade (2015-2024), the annual increase has accelerated to 2.6 ppm per year. As a result, the annual rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide over the past 60 years is 100-200 times faster than the increase that occurred at the end of the last ice age 11,000-17,000 years ago.\nCarbon dioxide is Earth\u2019s most important long-lived greenhouse gas: a gas that absorbs and radiates heat. Unlike oxygen or nitrogen (which make up most of Earth's atmosphere), greenhouse gases absorb heat radiating from the Earth\u2019s surface and re-release it in all directions\u2014including back toward Earth\u2019s surface. Without any carbon dioxide, Earth\u2019s natural greenhouse effect would be too weak to keep the average global surface temperature above freezing.\nBy adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, people are amplifying the natural greenhouse effect, causing global temperature to rise. According to observations and analysis by the NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory, carbon dioxide alone is responsible for about 80 percent of the total heating influence of all human-produced greenhouse gases since 1990.\nAnother reason carbon dioxide is important in the Earth system is that it dissolves into the ocean like the fizz in a can of soda. It reacts with water molecules, producing carbonic acid and lowering the ocean's pH (raising its acidity). Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, the pH of the ocean's surface waters has dropped from 8.21 to 8.10. This drop in pH is called ocean acidification, and it interferes with the ability of marine life to extract calcium from sea water to build skeletons and shells.\n(left) A healthy ocean snail has a transparent shell with smoothly contoured ridges.

Meltwater from Greenland might be expected to initiate a climate response that is distinct, and perhaps different from, that associated with Antarctic meltwater. Which one might elicit a greater climate response, and what mechanisms are involved? To explore these questions, we apply climate response functions (CRFs) to guide a series of meltwater-perturbation experiments using a fully coupled climate model. In both hemispheres, meltwater drives atmospheric cooling, sea ice expansion, and strengthened Hadley and Ferrel cells. Greenland meltwater induces a slowdown of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) and a cooling of the subsurface ocean in the northern high latitudes. Antarctic meltwater, instead, induces a slowdown of the Antarctic Bottom Water formation and a warming of the subsurface ocean around Antarctica. For melt rates up to 2000 Gt yr\u22121, the climate response is rather linear. However, as melt rates increase to 5000 Gt yr\u22121, the climate response becomes nonlinear. Due to a collapsed AMOC, the climate response is superlinear at high Greenland melt rates. Instead, the climate response is sublinear at high Antarctic melt rates, due to the halting of the northward expansion of Antarctic sea ice by warm surface waters. Finally, in the linear limit, we use CRFs and linear convolution theory to make projections of important climate parameters in response to meltwater scenarios, which suggest that Antarctic meltwater will become a major driver of climate change, dominating that of Greenland meltwater, as the current century proceeds.\nMelting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets is one of the most uncertain potential contributors to future climate change. In this study, we address the comparative role of Greenland and Antarctic meltwater in the climate system and explore the differing mechanisms at work in each hemisphere. We find that the climate response is linear for low melt rates but becomes nonlinear for high melt rates. As the century proceeds, we speculate that Antarctic meltwater will increasingly dominate that of Greenland meltwater, leading to atmospheric cooling, Antarctic sea ice expansion, and contraction and warming of the Antarctic Bottom Water. Greenland meltwater will, instead, affect smaller changes in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\u00a9 2023 American Meteorological Society.

Recent observations have shown that these ice sheets are melting at an accelerating rate (Paolo et al. 2015; Rignot et al. 2019; Mouginot et al. 2019; Shepherd et al. 2018, 2020; King et al. 2020). Between the periods of 1992\u20132011 and 2012\u201317, the rate of ice-mass loss has risen from roughly 100 to 250 Gt yr\u22121 in Greenland (Shepherd et al. 2020) and from 75 Gt yr\u22121 to roughly 200 Gt yr\u22121 in Antarctica (Shepherd et al. 2018). Since the 1990s, their combined contribution to global-mean sea level has been 18 mm, of which 10 mm came from Greenland (Shepherd et al. 2020) and 8 mm from Antarctica (Shepherd et al. 2018). The Greenland ice mass loss is ice-sheet-wide owing to rapidly increasing surface melting and ice dynamical imbalances (King et al. 2020). The Antarctic ice sheet retreat is largely due to ice-shelf basal melt and iceberg calving in roughly equal magnitude along the periphery, primarily in the Amundsen\u2013Bellingshausen Sea sectors (West Antarctica), Wilkes Land (East Antarctica), and the West and Northeast Peninsula (Rignot et al. 2019). Twenty-first-century simulations of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets forced with time-evolving ocean and climate fields derived from a high-emissions scenario suggest that the projected melt rates would exceed 500 and 5000 Gt yr\u22121, respectively, by 2100, leading to a total sea level rise in excess of 250 mm with meltwater feedback (Golledge et al. 2019).\nMeltwater from Greenland and Antarctica contributes not only to sea level but also initiates climate change through its effect, for example, on sea ice extent and the ocean\u2019s overturning circulation. One might expect the impacts of Greenland meltwater to be different from that of Antarctic meltwater because they act in different hemispheres and perturb different parts of the climate system. For example, it is thought that Antarctic meltwater spreading to the proximal ocean initiates surface cooling and freshening trends across the Southern Ocean (Bronselaer et al. 2018; Rye et al. 2020). Enhanced basal melt of Antarctic ice shelves (Rignot et al. 2013; Depoorter et al. 2013; Adusumilli et al. 2020) can cause significant sea ice expansion by suppressing convective mixing and its associated vertical heat exchange (Hellmer 2004; Bintanja et al. 2013). Meltwater discharge along the Antarctic continental shelf tends to weaken the Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) formation and abyssal ocean overturning (Silvano et al. 2018; Lago and England 2019; Li et al. 2023). Meltwater discharge from Greenland, meanwhile, can reduce deep ocean ventilation via a slowdown in the formation rate of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) originating in the Nordic seas [Greenland\u2013Iceland\u2013Norwegian (GIN) Seas] (B\u00f6ning et al. 2016), and a slowdown of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC; Rahmstorf et al. 2015; Bakker et al. 2016). Antarctic meltwater can also affect the AMOC, but the sense of the change remains controversial. Stouffer et al. (2007) found that the AMOC remains unchanged or slightly weakened due to Antarctic meltwater spreading across the sea surface i\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

With a more than 50% increase in CO2 since the start of industrial times in the 18th century, scientific measurements have linked this increase primarily to the burning of coal, oil, and gas. This means that CO2 levels are now 150% the value they were at in 1750 \u2014 this is at least 1.5 times greater than the natural increase observed at the end of the last ice age 20,000 years ago, which happened over thousands of years.\nThe animated map below shows the historical changes in global carbon dioxide over time. Note the colors change as the amount of CO2 rises from 365 parts per million (ppm) in 2002 to over 420 ppm in 2022. These measurements from the AIRS instrument come from the mid-troposphere, the layer of Earth's atmosphere that is 8 to 12 kilometers (about 5 to 7 miles) above the ground.\nA closer look at the carbon dioxide measurements at Mauna Loa shows a series of wiggles in the data. Although total CO2 is increasing each year, there is also a short-term cycle visible within the larger trend.\nThis annual rise and fall of CO2 levels is caused by seasonal cycles in photosynthesis on a global scale. In Northern Hemisphere spring, plants come to life and draw in CO2 to fuel their growth. This begins the process of lowering the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. In northern autumn, plant growth stops or slows down, and the whole process reverses itself. Much of the plant matter decomposes, releasing CO2 back to the atmosphere.\nA similar but less intense pattern repeats in the Southern Hemisphere in opposite seasons. Spring growth starts in September and winter decomposition begins in March, so CO2 records in the Southern Hemisphere show the opposite pattern of that seen in Mauna Loa. However, because there is a lot more land and vegetation in the Northern Hemisphere than the southern, the global yearly cycle more closely aligns with the northern seasons.\nSee the cycle in action in the visualization Watching Earth Breathe: The Seasonal Vegetation Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide.\nThis cycle of plant growth gives the graph of CO2 a sawtooth pattern of ups and downs from year to year. At a larger scale, the upward climb of the trend line over the decades is caused by CO2 emissions, primarily from burning fossil fuels. Thus, the data illustrate both natural factors and human additions of CO2.\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The increase over the last 60 years is 100 ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nParticipate in the 2025 international science photo competition!\nIn the atmosphere of Earth, carbon dioxide is a trace gas that plays an integral part in the greenhouse effect, carbon cycle, photosynthesis, and oceanic carbon cycle. It is one of three main greenhouse gases in the atmosphere of Earth. The concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere reached 427 ppm (0.0427%) on a molar basis in 2024, representing 3341 gigatonnes of CO2.[1] This is an increase of 50% since the start of the Industrial Revolution, up from 280 ppm during the 10,000 years prior to the mid-18th century.[2][3][4] The increase is due to human activity.[5]\nThe current increase in CO2 concentrations is primarily driven by the burning of fossil fuels.[6] Other significant human activities that emit CO2 include cement production, deforestation, and biomass burning. The increase in atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases such as methane increase the absorption and emission of infrared radiation by the atmosphere. This has led to a rise in average global temperature and ocean acidification. Another direct effect is the CO2 fertilization effect. The increase in atmospheric concentrations of CO2 causes a range of further effects of climate change on the environment and human living conditions.\nCarbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. It absorbs and emits infrared radiation at its two infrared-active vibrational frequencies. The two wavelengths are 4.26 \u03bcm (2,347 cm\u22121) (antisymmetric stretching vibrational mode) and 14.99 \u03bcm (667 cm\u22121) (bending vibrational mode). CO2 plays a significant role in influencing Earth's surface temperature through the greenhouse effect.[7] Light emission from the Earth's surface is most intense in the infrared region between 200 and 2500 cm\u22121,[8] as opposed to light emission from the much hotter Sun which is most intense in the visible region. Absorption of infrared light at the vibrational frequencies of atmospheric CO2 traps energy near the surface, warming the surface of Earth and its lower atmosphere. Less energy reaches the upper atmosphere, which is therefore cooler because of this absorption.[9]\nThe present atmospheric concentration of CO2 is the highest for 14 million years.[10] Concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere were as high as 4,000 ppm during the Cambrian period about 500 million years ago, and as low as 180 ppm during the Quaternary glaciation of the last two million years.[2] Reconstructed temperature records for the last 420 million years indicate that atmospheric CO2 concentrations peaked at approximately 2,000 ppm. This peak happened during the Devonian period (400 million years ago). Another peak occurred in the Triassic period (220\u2013200 million years ago).[11]\nSince the start of the Industrial Revolution, atmospheric CO2 concentration has been increasing, causing global warming and ocean acidification.[12] In October 2023 the average level of CO2 in Earth's atmosphere, adjusted for seasonal variation, was 422.17 parts per million by volume (ppm).[13] Figures are published monthly by the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).[14][15] The value had been about 280 ppm during the 10,000 years up to the mid-18th century.[2][3][4]\nEach part per million of CO2 in the atmosphere represents approximately 2.13 gigatonnes of carbon, or 7.82 gigatonnes of CO2.[16]\nIt was pointed out in 2021 that \"the current rates of increase of the concentration of the major greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide) are unprecedented over at least the last 800,000 years\".[17]: 515\nAs of 2024, it is estimated that 2,650 gigatonnes of CO2 have been emitted by human activity since 1850, with annual emissions of 42 gigatonnes per year. About 1,050 gigatonnes remain in the atmosphere following absorption by oceans and land.[18]\nSome fraction (a projected 20\u201335%) of the fossil carbon transferred thus far will persist in the atmosphere as elevated CO2 levels for many thousands of years after these carbon transfer activities begin to subside.[19][20]\nAtmospheric CO2 concentrations fluctuate slightly with the seasons, falling during the Northern Hemisphere spring and summer as plants consume the gas and rising during northern autumn and winter as plants go dormant or die and decay. The level drops by about 6 or 7 ppm (about 50 Gt) from May to September during the Northern Hemisphere's growing season, and then goes up by about 8 or 9 ppm. The Northern Hemisphere dominates the annual cycle of CO2 concentration because it has much greater land area and plant biomass in mid-latitudes (30-60 degrees) than the Southern Hemisphere. Concentrations reach a peak in May as the Northern Hemisphere spring greenup begins, and decline to a minimum in October, near the end of the growing season.[21][22]\nConcentrations also vary on a regional basis, most strongly near the ground with much smaller variations aloft. In urban areas concentrations are generally higher[23] and indoors they can reach 10 times background levels.\nThe concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are expressed as parts per million by volume (abbreviated as ppmv, or ppm(v), or just ppm). To convert from the usual ppmv units to ppm mass (abbreviated as ppmm, or ppm(m)), multiply by the ratio of the molar mass of CO2 to that of air, i.e. times 1.52 (44.01 divided by 28.96).\nThe first reproducibly accurate measurements of atmospheric CO2 were from flask sample measurements made by Dave Keeling at Caltech in the 1950s.[32] Measurements at Mauna Loa have been ongoing since 1958. Additionally, measurements are also made at many other sites around the world. Many measurement sites are part of larger global networks. Global network data are often made publicly available.\nThere are several surface measurement (including flasks and continuous in situ) networks including NOAA/ERSL,[33] WDCGG,[34] and RAMCES.[35] The NOAA/ESRL Baseline Observatory Network, and the Scripps Institution of O\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

This shift is critical to tackling the climate crisis, as fossil fuels still provide 80 percent of global energy supply, releasing immense amounts of planet-warming gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, in the process.\nAt its core, the sustainable energy transition seeks to transform the global energy system to combat climate change while fostering sustainable development. It involves not only adopting cleaner energy sources but also enhancing energy efficiency, deploying advanced technologies like energy storage, and decarbonizing key sectors such as electricity, transportation and industry.\nHowever, beyond being a technological shift, this transition is a transformative process that prioritizes equity, inclusion and human development. Central to the sustainable energy transition is the concept of a just transition, ensuring fairness and inclusion for all, particularly for those in fossil-fuel intensive industries who stand to lose jobs and income and communities who are more vulnerable to rising costs of living and energy insecurity.\nTherefore, the sustainable energy transition not only delivers environmental benefits but also drives innovation, creates jobs and reduces energy poverty. It represents a unique opportunity to address common global challenges like energy access disparities, energy security, inequality and health impacts through integrated and transformative solutions, laying the foundation for a sustainable, inclusive and resilient future.\nThe current energy system is a major driver of global climate change, accounting for around 75 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions. As temperatures break records year after year, transforming how we produce and consume energy is essential.\nUnder the Paris Agreement, a legally binding international treaty on climate change, countries have committed to deep, rapid and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to limit global warming to well below 2\u00b0 C above pre-industrial levels, preferably to 1.5\u00b0 C. The world\u2019s ability to meet this goal hinges on the energy sector\u2019s ability to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.\nThe case for action has never been stronger. The landmark decision from the first Global Stocktake, adopted at COP28 in Dubai in 2023, outlines transformative energy-related pathways and approaches that countries must pursue, including:\nThe decision highlights the urgency to accelerate global efforts towards a net-zero emission energy system, one that produces little or no carbon emissions from fossil fuels and industrial processes, before 2050.\nDespite commitments through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategies (LT-LEDS) and net-zero goals, the current efforts by governments and the private sector are not enough to keep global average temperature rise below 1.5\u00b0C.\nCurrent pledges, including the COP28 commitments, could cut emissions by 3 percent by 2030 and 51 percent by 2050 compared to 2022 levels. At this rate, global energy-related emissions would reach 35.2 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (GtCO2) in 2030 \u2013 far above the 23 GtCO2 required to keep the world on a 1.5\u00b0C pathway. While this represents some progress, it falls well short of what is needed to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change.\nWithout a swift energy transition, it will be impossible to meet the vast emissions reductions needed for climate change mitigation. The next cycle of updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) offers an opportunity for countries to lay out measurable and actionable energy sector targets that are well aligned with existing energy, climate and development policies, and highlight investment opportunities across both public and private sectors.\nEnsuring a just transition The sustainable energy transition can bring disruptive changes, such as higher costs of living, job displacement and loss of income or increased energy insecurity. It is important that countries act to mitigate these unintended impacts, for example, in regions with concentrated industrialization and on vulnerable populations. A just and inclusive transition is a powerful catalyst for creating green jobs, adapting education systems, building inclusive and effective institutions and advancing social, environmental and economic justice.\nScaling up renewable energy production Decarbonizing the energy sector by rapidly scaling up renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and hydropower is critical \u2013 not just for cutting emissions but also for expanding energy access in underserved communities. Currently, renewable energy is the cheapest option for new electricity in almost every country in the world. Projections show that renewables could account for over 90 percent of global electricity generation by 2050, accelerating the path to a net-zero energy system. Clean electricity is also the foundation for transforming other sectors, from industry to transportation.\nDecarbonizing sectors reliant on fossil fuels Some sectors that rely heavily on fossil fuels and contribute significantly to global emissions include transportation (13.7 percent), manufacturing and construction (12.7 percent) and buildings (6.6 percent). Electrification powered by clean energy is the most effective pathway to decarbonize some of these areas. For example, renewable-powered electric vehicles can replace gasoline-powered cars, heat pumps can provide energy-efficient heating and cooling for buildings, and induction cooktops offer cleaner alternatives to biomass and gas stoves.\nHowever, not all sectors can be fully decarbonized through electrification alone.

Mai 20246 Min. Lesedauer\nThe world is heating up. Last year, 2023 registered the warmest year since global records began in 1850 at 1.18\u00b0C (2.12\u00b0F) above the 20th-century average of 13.9\u00b0C (57\u00b0F). According to scientists from NOAA\u2019s National Centers for Environmental Information, this is 0.15\u00b0C (0.27\u00b0F) above the previous record set in 2016. In fact, the 10 warmest years since 1850 have all occurred during the last decade.\nBut is this change in climate causing more extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, floods, wildfires and heat waves?\nAccording to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) , \u201cclimate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe.\u201d But it is difficult to gauge the precise impact of climate change on specific extreme weather events as John Scott, Head of Sustainability Risk for Zurich Insurance Group (Zurich), explains.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a complex task to disentangle the natural variations in extreme weather from the effects of climate change. While some climate change impacts are already obvious, such as retreating glaciers and sea level rise from melting land ice, the impact on today\u2019s weather is harder to interpret,\u201d Scott says.\nAttributing extreme weather to climate change\nLearn how Zurich\u2019s PERC analysis is helping us to better understand the impact of extreme weather events.\nWhether climate change has made an extreme weather event more likely or not is subject to a growing field of research known as climate attribution science. As a result of this research, meteorologists and climate scientists are beginning to understand how prolonged periods of heat and cold can be closely attributable to ongoing global warming.

Last year, 2023 registered the warmest year since global records began in 1850 at 1.18\u00b0C (2.12\u00b0F) above the 20th-century average of 13.9\u00b0C (57\u00b0F). According to scientists from NOAA\u2019s National Centers for Environmental Information, this is 0.15\u00b0C (0.27\u00b0F) above the previous record set in 2016. In fact, the 10 warmest years since 1850 have all occurred during the last decade.\nBut is this change in climate causing more extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, floods, wildfires and heat waves?\nAccording to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) , \u201cclimate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe.\u201d But it is difficult to gauge the precise impact of climate change on specific extreme weather events as John Scott, Head of Sustainability Risk for Zurich Insurance Group (Zurich), explains.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a complex task to disentangle the natural variations in extreme weather from the effects of climate change. While some climate change impacts are already obvious, such as retreating glaciers and sea level rise from melting land ice, the impact on today\u2019s weather is harder to interpret,\u201d Scott says.\nAttributing extreme weather to climate change\nLearn how Zurich\u2019s PERC analysis is helping us to better understand the impact of extreme weather events.\nWhether climate change has made an extreme weather event more likely or not is subject to a growing field of research known as climate attribution science. As a result of this research, meteorologists and climate scientists are beginning to understand how prolonged periods of heat and cold can be closely attributable to ongoing global warming. For instance, rising surface temperatures on land are connected to the likelihood and severity of droughts and wildfires in hot, arid regions.\nBut what about windstorms? Rising temperatures and warmer seas mean more water vapor evaporates into the atmosphere, providing fuel for hurricanes and torrential rain. A warmer and moister atmosphere \u2013 combined with warmer oceans \u2013 increases the impact of tropical cyclones, for instance, becoming more intense, producing more rainfall, affecting new areas, and becoming larger and longer-lived.\n\u201cWe can see now from the empirical data that tropical cyclones are behaving differently,\u201d adds Scott. \u201cThey are going further inland where they then become rainstorm and flooding events.
