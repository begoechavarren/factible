    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nhere's my favorite way to jump start health get off medications bolster your immune system and cut off the weight and burn the fat very quickly a three-day juice cleanse comes straight from an alternative cancer center so specific ingredients i'm going to show you in just a moment that is used to bolster the immune system and if done right based on research out of california you can crank up not only your fat loss but your immune system it literally starts to clean out your body if you do it the right way i'm going to show you the absolute keys when it comes to a three-day juice cleanse if you want to venture in just to one day or two day that's gonna be fantastic as well but i encourage followers of the living good daily lifestyle to do this once a month once a month cleaning this out you can throw this at any time especially if you're up against a wall you've been stuck you need progress you just had a bad vacation you fell off the wagon got ran over by the wagon you need to bounce back quickly here is exactly how to do it and the keys but let me talk a little bit more about the benefits of green juice and specifically just drinking that all day long it's going to lower your insulin if you make it right which i'm going to show you in just a few moments of how to make it proper so you don't raise insulin you're going to be lowering it which is an absolute key for getting the fat off the body it's going to help increase your human growth hormone that's right it increases the hormones that build muscle the more muscle you have you crank up the more metabolism a lot of people think you're going to lose a lot of muscle this way but if you do do it right you can actually gain it's going to increase that weight loss it's going to crank up that fat burning machine because you're going to be detoxing so much so many people when they start burning fat the fat contains toxins the toxins are released into the system they're floating around the blood and if they are not eliminated quickly they just take back up into tissue somewhere else and they're restored as fat it's called the rebounding effect so we want to increase weight loss by detoxing the system energy is going up you are putting in so much water so much cleansing so many nutrients when you're doing a juice cleanse like this and then if you do it proper which i'm gonna show you the ingredients in a moment you hit autophagy ding that's like the magic autophagy that is where your body starts recycling if you're not putting in lots of food because you're doing a green juice cleanse you're put your body starts to find other raw materials to make cells out of like old stuff sitting around the scrap pieces of wood and metal viruses microbes it cleans house that's where you want to be if you want long living graceful aging and less disease autophagy is where you want to be it aids the gut it aids the probiotics it gives that digestive system the nutrients that it needs to build up the microbiome which by the way makes up 70 plus percent of your immune system it gives the digestive system a rest some of you have not gone a day your entire life without eating give it a break so much of your energy there isn't a thing you could possibly do on this planet that would expend more energy than your digestive system does on a daily basis not a marathon not anything your digestive system takes a bulk of your energy if you give it a break your energy is going up you're going to feel great so those are the benefits of green juicing what are the keys based on a alternative cancer center that helps people through alternative ways of taking care of their cancer this comes straight from them and it nothing magical nothing proprietary but it helped me to understand this better to keep insulin down and get all the benefits of green juice here's what i used to make it out of number one are green apples granny smiths the red ones have a higher sugar content which is going to spike insulin more we want to keep this lower carbohydrate so we can get into autophagy so make sure the apples are green cucumbers oh you can see the video below for cucumbers their benefits i love cucumbers plus you get a lot of juice out of them so when you are juicing these vegetables it goes much further so i like to add several of those lemons fantastic one of the most nutritious fruits that there is contains a plethora of vitamins all the vitamins you need right there in that lemon celery another one there's a video below for you to check out the extreme effects of celery amazing for your digestive tract especially your stomach and for supporting your liver and detoxing you spinach is next great source of did i spell spinach let me make that an h great source of iron and other vital minerals that you can get in so that goes always kale this is always at the top of the scoring system if you go to the grocery store some grocery stores have this most nutritious food bam kale's always at the top of it broccoli i love broccoli it's so good there's a video below to help you fall in love with broccoli as well i eat this almost every day it is very anti-cancer next is parsley there's another parsley video as well parsley juice is incredible for uh vitamin c antioxidants iron it has more iron than spinach so it's really good for anemia it helps support so many different things parsley is a big one folic acid helps keep homocysteine down lowers your inflammation and then finally you can add in some dandelion which has a very good detox of iron effect so that's what i make the green juice out of you're going to want to get while you're doing this juice cleanse you're going to be taking in water in between the juice you're going to want to get in between 64 and 128 ounces of the juice i would aim for 64s if it's your first time doing it but you can make it out of this one of these if you're following uh will make if you do it proper 32 ounces you'll need to make a couple of them you can use greens powder which already has things like dried parsley dried broccoli dried kale dry spinach try celery dry cucumbers already in there and that greens powder is linked below so i use that in conjunction i just have this for breakfast each morning but you would be just drinking just this i combine the juice with the greens powder to get extra nutrients but it keeps low insulin because it's low carbohydrate that's key with the juice and with the juice powder you can also add in broth or collagen these are very insulin friendly they're going to help your gut during this process they're not going to spike that insulin level and if you like enjoying your tea and your coffee that's great maybe cut back on the milk or the dairy the creamer especially no sugars in there but if you do want a little bit of that so you don't involve like a headache or something wow
