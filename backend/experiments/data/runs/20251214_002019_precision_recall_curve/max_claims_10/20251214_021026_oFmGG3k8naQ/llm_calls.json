    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nhi everyone this is monty i've been doing some investigation into the floor nation of our uh water here in lebanon oregon and i got a letter from the harvard university they posted in the federal government's journal confirms that fluoride lowers iqs and that was on july 27 2012. you can you can most likely find it in uh just by typing in but you can see it's a major harvard university study that confirms that the fluorination of our city water lowers our children's iq now you would think that that would cause writing in the streets demanding that we would have fluoride removed from our water but ironically it doesn't another study this one done by harvard university on july 26th that says it was published in the national institute of health journal finds that fluoride lowers children's iq that's the florida nation of your city water and this is the article right here again it's a harvard university study now both of those were done in this year and you would think that as soon as the american people found out for sure through harvard university after they've done extensive studies that the fluoridation of our water supply causes our children redox retardation making our children's iqs lower causing problems and and families and health you think that people would uh be freaking out and getting the flu right out you think we wouldn't even have to ask our governments and our townships to remove the fluoride fluoride from our water they don't do it you have to fight tooth and now and chances are they're sterile aren't going to do it but if you're not worried about lowering iqs you know everybody says oh my kid's stupid you know we're used to hearing it but here's another release published in april 5th 2006 another one from harvard university studies shows a link between fluorinated water and bone cancer in boys so you know it just goes on and on it's just link after link all of these studies from harvard university uh not to mention the 3600 000 other studies that have been done by numerous people that just plagues this whole fluoridation of water and that people aren't doing anything about it they're not stopping it why is this being put in our water when it is causing the iqs of our children to be lowered causing uh all kinds of problems now here's a great thing me and my girl went to see her obgyn the other day and she had some work done on her while i was in the office i was talking to this specialist with women and children this lady is a doctor who specializes in child rearing and and women issues and stuff and i asked her what she knew about fluoride and she said that she strongly recommends that babies be fed special water that has been specially more foreign more fluorination put in the baby's water for the use of their uh for for their feedings and i asked her if she looked into it she said she felt some concerns about the recent stories of uh you know how fluoride is linked in in brain damage and she she said she hadn't really looked into it too much and i said well i just got you know i told her the story i just got this information on july 26 27th that uh from harvard saying that they definitely have confirmed it does lower uh children's iq and she said for years she'd been telling mothers of newborn babies to buy fluorinated water to feed their babies to put in their babies bottles so that their baby's teeth would be better and stronger well here's an interesting note the nurse that was helping this doctor says hey wait a minute uh i come from austin texas and they have natural fluorination of the water there where the water is over fluorinated and everybody in the town all the town of 300 000 people have white pitted stuff on their teeth and uh she said and everybody in the town acts literally like a bunch of dumbasses those are her words not mine she said that it's just a bunch of hooligans and everybody's kind of hillbilly mentality real low iq individuals and of course their waters naturally overflowed fluorinated it's called uh fluorination opmosis or something like that when you have too much fluorine in your body you get uh white spots on your teeth now here's just a thought if you know anybody with white spots on their teeth ask them a couple of simple questions and see if they're a dumbass because from what i hear from this nurse the people over in austin texas or somewhere around that uh all live in a town where the water has too much fluorine in it naturally and they're all a bunch of dumbasses uh hicks you know she this is her words not mine i i don't know i live in lebanon oregon and uh at any rate get sidetracked here there's all these studies out there saying that uh people who generally are angry and have gang-related problems and are fighting and are criminals usually have lower iqs people who are afraid when you become afraid your iq automatically goes down you lose a couple of points when you get really scared also when you get really angry you lose a couple of points you know it's briefly that's why people who get angry do stupid things what happens when you feed a baby from birth fluorinated water and they drink it their whole life haven't you noticed lately that our kids in america or just slightly not normal i have and i'm only 46 years old and i've noticed a huge decline in intelligence in our kids and i believe the world steady on children's iqs america's kids come in way under the mark like a hundred in the world our children that are being fed by by our country fluoride have the lowest iqs in in the world i mean there's a few countries that are lower in ours but i'm not even really sure there's anybody living there anyway these are just my views and they're backed with you know facts and i did talk to an ogbyn who said that she was recommending that babies drink specially high fluorinated water babies teeth fall out and they get new ones wouldn't it make more sense to wait until they were older to drink fluorinated water however fluoride isn't something that's brought in through the body system through digestion it's a topical thing if you go to a dentist the dentist puts it in a cup and sticks it on your teeth it's because it's absorbed through the teeth it's not absorbed through the body by drinking it and what what parts of it is is absorbed through it would require large amounts for it to do anything your teeth uh hence austin texas and then getting the white spots on their teeth look this stuff up it's on the internet i would like everybody to go and stop the fluorination of water and i think that we need to investigate how this stuff got put in and what is behind it now some people say well monty you're just a conspiracy theorist well that may very well be true but at least if i'm a conspiracy theorist then these people over in the harvard university need to be tarred and feathered because they're saying the same thing i am fluoride makes our children a bunch of retards anyways if you have any thoughts about this feel free to uh drop me a message also you know share this information and hit like on there and also uh subscribe thank you have a good day",

Extremely high levels of fluoride are known to cause neurotoxicity in adults, and negative impacts on memory and learning have been reported in rodent studies, but little is known about the substance\u2019s impact on children\u2019s neurodevelopment. In a meta-analysis, researchers from Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) and China Medical University in Shenyang for the first time combined 27 studies and found strong indications that fluoride may adversely affect cognitive development in children. Based on the findings, the authors say that this risk should not be ignored, and that more research on fluoride\u2019s impact on the developing brain is warranted.\nThe study was published online in Environmental Health Perspectives on July 20, 2012.\nThe researchers conducted a systematic review of studies, almost all of which are from China where risks from fluoride are well-established. Fluoride is a naturally occurring substance in groundwater, and exposures to the chemical are increased in some parts of China. Virtually no human studies in this field have been conducted in the U.S., said lead author Anna Choi, research scientist in the Department of Environmental Health at HSPH.\nEven though many of the studies on children in China differed in many ways or were incomplete, the authors consider the data compilation and joint analysis an important first step in evaluating the potential risk. \u201cFor the first time we have been able to do a comprehensive meta-analysis that has the potential for helping us plan better studies. We want to make sure that cognitive development is considered as a possible target for fluoride toxicity,\u201d Choi said.\nChoi and senior author Philippe Grandjean, adjunct professor of environmental health at HSPH, and their colleagues collated the epidemiological studies of children exposed to fluoride from drinking water. The China National Knowledge Infrastructure database also was included to locate studies published in Chinese journals. They then analyzed possible associations with IQ measures in more than 8,000 children of school age; all but one study suggested that high fluoride content in water may negatively affect cognitive development.\nThe average loss in IQ was reported as a standardized weighted mean difference of 0.45, which would be approximately equivalent to seven IQ points for commonly used IQ scores with a standard deviation of 15.* Some studies suggested that even slightly increased fluoride exposure could be toxic to the brain. Thus, children in high-fluoride areas had significantly lower IQ scores than those who lived in low-fluoride areas. The children studied were up to 14 years of age, but the investigators speculate that any toxic effect on brain development may have happened earlier, and that the brain may not be fully capable of compensating for the toxicity.\n\u201cFluoride seems to fit in with lead, mercury, and other poisons that cause chemical brain drain,\u201d Grandjean says. \u201cThe effect of each toxicant may seem small, but the combined damage on a population scale can be serious, especially because the brain power of the next generation is crucial to all of us.\u201d\n* This sentence was updated on September 5, 2012.\nRead a September 2012 statement by the authors.\n** Learn more about the IQ measurements by HSPH\u2019s Anna L.

Most of the fluoride that people consume comes from fluoridated water, foods and beverages prepared with fluoridated water, and toothpaste and other dental products containing fluoride [2,3].\nApproximately 80% or more of orally ingested fluoride is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract [1]. In adults, about 50% of absorbed fluoride is retained in the body, with all but 1% stored in bones and teeth [1,3]. The other 50% is excreted in urine [1]. In young children, up to 80% of absorbed fluoride is retained because more is taken up by bones and teeth than in adults [1].\nIndividual fluoride status is not typically assessed, although fluoride concentrations can be measured in plasma, saliva, urine, bones, nails, hair, and teeth [4,5]. Criteria for adequate, high, or low levels of fluoride in the body have not been established.\nIntake recommendations for fluoride and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [1]. DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following:\nThe FNB found the data insufficient to derive EARs for fluoride. Therefore, the board established AIs for all ages using estimated intakes shown to maximize reductions in the incidence of dental caries without unwanted side effects, such as dental fluorosis, a chronic condition resulting from the consumption of too much fluoride when teeth are developing [1]. Table 1 lists the current AIs for fluoride for healthy individuals.\nBrewed tea typically contains higher levels of fluoride than most foods, depending on the type of tea and its source, because tea plants take up fluoride from soil [1,3]. Fluoride levels can range from 0.3 to 6.5 mg/L (0.07 to 1.5 mg/cup) in brewed tea made with distilled water [3].\nFluoride concentrations in breast milk are so low that they cannot always be detected; when these levels can be measured, they range from less than 0.002 to 0.01 mg/L, even when mothers live in communities with fluoridated water [3]. Fluoride concentrations in cow\u2019s milk are also very low, ranging from 0.007 to 0.086 mg/L [3]. Fluoride levels in infant formulas in the United States vary, depending on the type of formula and the fluoride content of the water used to prepare the formula [3]. The typical fluoride concentration is less than 0.2 mg/L in milk-based infant formula and 0.2 to 0.3 mg/L in soy-based infant formula (not including contributions from tap water used to prepare the formula).\nOnly trace amounts of fluoride are naturally present in most foods, and most foods not prepared with fluoridated water provide less than 0.05 mg/100 g [1,6].\nA variety of types of foods and their fluoride levels per serving are listed in Table 2.\n*Amounts of fluoride might vary by levels in the water used to prepare these foods and beverages.\nSince 1962, the U.S. Public Health Service has recommended the addition of fluoride to drinking (tap) water to reduce the risk and severity of dental caries, one of the most common chronic diseases in children [8]. Many countries around the world now adjust the fluoride concentration of community drinking water supplies to the level recommended for the prevention of dental caries [9].\nAlthough the U.S. Public Health Service recommended fluoride concentrations of 0.7 in warmer climates (where children were expected to drink more water) to 1.2 mg/L in cooler climates to prevent dental caries in 1962, it amended its recommended level in 2015 to 0.7 mg/L to maintain the ability to prevent caries while minimizing the risk of dental fluorosis [8,10]. In 1986, guidelines from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established a maximum allowable concentration of 4.0 mg/L fluoride in public drinking water systems to prevent adverse effects from fluoride exposure (such as bone disease) and a recommended maximum concentration of 2.0 mg/L to prevent dental fluorosis [3,11]. The EPA is currently reviewing this regulation [12].\nFluoridated municipal drinking water\u2014including water that people drink as well as foods and beverages prepared using municipal drinking water\u2014accounts for about 60% of fluoride intakes in the United States [3,8]. In 2020, 62.9% of the U.S. population had access to a fluoridated community water system [13]. The fluoride additives used to fluoridate drinking water in the United States are fluorosilicic acid, sodium fluorosilicate, and sodium fluoride [14]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a webpage that lists fluoride levels in tap water by county [15]. Because of differences in amounts of fluoride in groundwater, private water sources (including well water) have variable fluoride concentrations [11].\nFluoride is not typically added to bottled drinking waters. However, when fluoride is added, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) stipulates that the total amount of fluoride (added plus naturally occurring) cannot exceed 0.7 mg/L [7]. Previously allowable levels ranged from 0.8 to 1.7 mg/L. FDA notes that this rule does not apply to bottled water without added fluoride that contains fluoride naturally from its source water. The amount of fluoride contained in bottled water is not required to be listed on the product label unless the label makes a claim about the product\u2019s fluoride content [16].\nOnly a few d\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Extremely high levels of fluoride are known to cause neurotoxicity in adults, and negative impacts on memory and learning have been reported in rodent studies, but little is known about the substance\u2019s impact on children\u2019s neurodevelopment. In a meta-analysis, researchers from Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) and China Medical University in Shenyang for the first time combined 27 studies and found strong indications that fluoride may adversely affect cognitive development in children. Based on the findings, the authors say that this risk should not be ignored, and that more research on fluoride\u2019s impact on the developing brain is warranted.\nThe study was published online in Environmental Health Perspectives on July 20, 2012.\nThe researchers conducted a systematic review of studies, almost all of which are from China where risks from fluoride are well-established. Fluoride is a naturally occurring substance in groundwater, and exposures to the chemical are increased in some parts of China. Virtually no human studies in this field have been conducted in the U.S., said lead author Anna Choi, research scientist in the Department of Environmental Health at HSPH.\nEven though many of the studies on children in China differed in many ways or were incomplete, the authors consider the data compilation and joint analysis an important first step in evaluating the potential risk. \u201cFor the first time we have been able to do a comprehensive meta-analysis that has the potential for helping us plan better studies. We want to make sure that cognitive development is considered as a possible target for fluoride toxicity,\u201d Choi said.\nChoi and senior author Philippe Grandjean, adjunct professor of environmental health at HSPH, and their colleagues collated the epidemiological studies of children exposed to fluoride from drinking water. The China National Knowledge Infrastructure database also was included to locate studies published in Chinese journals. They then analyzed possible associations with IQ measures in more than 8,000 children of school age; all but one study suggested that high fluoride content in water may negatively affect cognitive development.\nThe average loss in IQ was reported as a standardized weighted mean difference of 0.45, which would be approximately equivalent to seven IQ points for commonly used IQ scores with a standard deviation of 15.* Some studies suggested that even slightly increased fluoride exposure could be toxic to the brain. Thus, children in high-fluoride areas had significantly lower IQ scores than those who lived in low-fluoride areas. The children studied were up to 14 years of age, but the investigators speculate that any toxic effect on brain development may have happened earlier, and that the brain may not be fully capable of compensating for the toxicity.\n\u201cFluoride seems to fit in with lead, mercury, and other poisons that cause chemical brain drain,\u201d Grandjean says. \u201cThe effect of each toxicant may seem small, but the combined damage on a population scale can be serious, especially because the brain power of the next generation is crucial to all of us.\u201d\n* This sentence was updated on September 5, 2012.\nRead a September 2012 statement by the authors.\n** Learn more about the IQ measurements by HSPH\u2019s Anna L. Choi and Philippe Grandjean in response to a letter to the journal published in the March 2013 (Vol. 121, No. 3) Environmental Health Perspectives.\nDecember 19, 2014 \u2014 As a follow-up, Philippe Grandjean, adjunct professor of environmental health at Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH), Anna Choi, research scientist in the Department of Environmental Health, and colleagues have published a pilot study of cognitive functions in Chinese children exposed to different levels of fluoride from drinking water.\nThe new paper, entitled \u201cAssociation of lifetime exposure to fluoride and cognitive functions in Chinese children: A pilot study,\u201d has been published online and in the January-February 2015 issue of Neurotoxicology and Teratology.\n\u2014 Marge Dwyer\nStay connected with Harvard Chan School\nIn addition to our degree programs, we offer highly targeted executive and continuing education, directed and taught by Harvard faculty.\nStay connected with newsletters on climate, nutrition, communication \u2014 and the latest from Harvard Chan School.\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet.\nFluoride, a mineral, is naturally present in many foods and available as a dietary supplement. Fluoride is the ionic form of the element fluorine, and it inhibits or reverses the initiation and progression of dental caries (tooth decay) and stimulates new bone formation [1].\nSoil, water, plants, and foods contain trace amounts of fluoride. Most of the fluoride that people consume comes from fluoridated water, foods and beverages prepared with fluoridated water, and toothpaste and other dental products containing fluoride [2,3].\nApproximately 80% or more of orally ingested fluoride is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract [1]. In adults, about 50% of absorbed fluoride is retained in the body, with all but 1% stored in bones and teeth [1,3]. The other 50% is excreted in urine [1]. In young children, up to 80% of absorbed fluoride is retained because more is taken up by bones and teeth than in adults [1].\nIndividual fluoride status is not typically assessed, although fluoride concentrations can be measured in plasma, saliva, urine, bones, nails, hair, and teeth [4,5]. Criteria for adequate, high, or low levels of fluoride in the body have not been established.\nIntake recommendations for fluoride and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [1]. DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following:\nThe FNB found the data insufficient to derive EARs for fluoride. Therefore, the board established AIs for all ages using estimated intakes shown to maximize reductions in the incidence of dental caries without unwanted side effects, such as dental fluorosis, a chronic condition resulting from the consumption of too much fluoride when teeth are developing [1]. Table 1 lists the current AIs for fluoride for healthy individuals.\nBrewed tea typically contains higher levels of fluoride than most foods, depending on the type of tea and its source, because tea plants take up fluoride from soil [1,3]. Fluoride levels can range from 0.3 to 6.5 mg/L (0.07 to 1.5 mg/cup) in brewed tea made with distilled water [3].\nFluoride concentrations in breast milk are so low that they cannot always be detected; when these levels can be measured, they range from less than 0.002 to 0.01 mg/L, even when mothers live in communities with fluoridated water [3]. Fluoride concentrations in cow\u2019s milk are also very low, ranging from 0.007 to 0.086 mg/L [3]. Fluoride levels in infant formulas in the United States vary, depending on the type of formula and the fluoride content of the water used to prepare the formula [3]. The typical fluoride concentration is less than 0.2 mg/L in milk-based infant formula and 0.2 to 0.3 mg/L in soy-based infant formula (not including contributions from tap water used to prepare the formula).\nOnly trace amounts of fluoride are naturally present in most foods, and most foods not prepared with fluoridated water provide less than 0.05 mg/100 g [1,6].\nA variety of types of foods and their fluoride levels per serving are listed in Table 2.\n*Amounts of fluoride might vary by levels in the water used to prepare these foods and beverages.\nSince 1962, the U.S. Public Health Service has recommended the addition of fluoride to drinking (tap) water to reduce the risk and severity of dental caries, one of the most common chronic diseases in children [8]. Many countries around the world now adjust the fluoride concentration of community drinking water supplies to the level recommended for the prevention of dental caries [9].\nAlthough the U.S. Public Health Service recommended fluoride concentrations of 0.7 in warmer climates (where children were expected to drink more water) to 1.2 mg/L in cooler climates to prevent dental caries in 1962, it amended its recommended level in 2015 to 0.7 mg/L to maintain the ability to prevent caries while minimizing the risk of dental fluorosis [8,10]. In 1986, guidelines from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established a maximum allowable concentration of 4.0 mg/L fluoride in public drinking water systems to prevent adverse effects from fluoride exposure (such as bone disease) and a recommended maximum concentration of 2.0 mg/L to prevent dental fluorosis [3,11]. The EPA is currently reviewing this regulation [12].\nFluoridated municipal drinking water\u2014including water that people drink as well as foods and beverages prepared using municipal drinking water\u2014accounts for about 60% of fluoride intakes in the United States [3,8]. In 2020, 62.9% of the U.S. population had access to a fluoridated community water system [13]. The fluoride additives used to fluoridate drinking water in the United States are fluorosilicic acid, sodium fluorosilicate, and sodium fluoride [14]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a webpage that lists fluoride levels in tap water by county [15]. Because of differences in amounts of fluoride in groundwater, private water sources (including well water) have variable fluoride concentrations [11].\nFluoride is not typically added to bottled drinking waters. However, when fluoride is added, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) stipulates that the total amount of fluoride (added plus naturally occurring) cannot exceed 0.7 mg/L [7]. Previously allowable levels ranged from 0.8 to 1.7 mg/L. FDA notes that this rule does not apply to bottled water without added fluoride that contains fluoride naturally from its source water. The amount of fluoride contained in bottled water is not required to be listed on the product label unless the label makes a claim about the product\u2019s fluoride content [16].\nOnly a few d\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Water is the major dietary source of fluoride. The only known association with low fluoride intake is the risk of dental caries. Initially, fluoride was considered beneficial when given systemically during tooth development, but later research has shown the importance and the advantages of its topical effects in the prevention or treatment of dental caries and tooth decay. Water fluoridation was once heralded as one of the best public health achievements in the twentieth century. Since this practice is not feasible or cost effective in many regions, especially rural areas, researchers and policy makers have explored other methods of introducing fluoride to the general population such as adding fluoride to milk and table salt. Lately, major concerns about excessive fluoride intake and related toxicity were raised worldwide, leading several countries to ban fluoridation. Health-care professionals and the public need guidance regarding the debate around fluoridation. This paper reviews the different aspects of fluoridation, their effectiveness in dental caries prevention and their risks. It was performed in the PubMed and the Google Scholar databases in January 2018 without limitation as to the publication period.\nKeywords: dental caries, fluoridation, prevention, public health, toxicity\nFluoride is the ionic form of fluorine, the thirteenth most abundant element in the earth\u2019s crust. It is released into the environment naturally in both water and air. Its concentration in water is variable (1). Water is the major dietary source of fluoride. The variability in water content explains much of the variability in total fluoride intake. Other important sources of fluoride are tea, seafood that contains edible bones or shells, medicinal supplements, and fluoridated toothpastes (2). Fluoride compounds are also produced by some industrial processes that use the mineral apatite, a mixture of calcium phosphate compounds (2). Dietary fluoride is absorbed rapidly in the stomach and small intestine. One-quarter to one-third of the absorbed fluoride is taken up into calcified tissues, whereas the rest is lost in the urine (3\u20136). In bone and teeth, fluoride can displace hydroxyl ions from hydroxyapatite to produce fluorapatite or fluorohydroxyapatite. About 99% of total body fluoride is contained in bones and teeth (3), and the amount steadily increases during life. The recommended intake for fluoride is expressed as an adequate intake rather than recommended dietary allowance, because of the limited data available to determine the population needs. The adequate intake for fluoride is 0.7 mg daily for toddlers, rising to 3 mg daily for adult women and 4 mg daily for adult men. It remains unclear whether fluoride is truly essential, although fluoride may have some beneficial effects (2). Once taken up into bone, fluoride appears to increase osteoblast activity and bone density, especially in the lumbar spine (7). Fluoride has been suggested as a therapy for osteoporosis since the 1960s, but despite producing denser bone, fracture risk is not reduced. Indeed, there is some evidence that nonvertebral fractures may be increased (8). The only known association with low fluoride intake is the risk of dental caries, acting through both pre-eruptive and post-eruptive mechanisms (5). The American Dental Association strongly supports fluoridation of community drinking water supplies (4); however, strong contradictory opinions also are held (9).\nDental caries is an infectious and multifactorial disease afflicting most people in industrialized and developing countries. Fluoride reduces the incidence of dental caries and slows or reverses the progression of existing lesions (10). Although pit and fissure sealants, meticulous oral hygiene, and appropriate dietary practices contribute to caries prevention and control, the most effective and widely used approaches include fluoride use (11).\nThe first \u2018artificial\u2019 water fluoridation for caries control was introduced in 1945 and 1946 in the United States (US) and Canada, respectively, and it was expected that caries prevalence would be reduced by as much as 50% (12). The success of water fluoridation in preventing and controlling dental caries led to the development of several fluoride-containing products, including toothpaste, mouth rinse, dietary supplements, and professionally applied or prescribed gel, foam, or varnish.\nMuch of the research on the efficacy and effectiveness of individual fluoride modalities in preventing and controlling dental caries was conducted before 1980, when dental caries were more common and more severe. Several modes of fluoride use have evolved, each with its own recommended concentration, frequency of use, and dosage schedule. Simultaneously, recent resistance has been growing worldwide against fluoridation, emphasizing the possible risk of toxicity. Thus, health-care professionals and the public need guidance regarding the debate around fluoridation. This review examines the different aspects of fluoridation, their effectiveness in dental caries prevention, and their risks.\nFluoride works to control early dental caries in several ways. Due to its anticariogenic and antimicrobial properties, the fluoride ion (F\u2212) has been widely used in the treatment of dental caries. The antibacterial action of fluoride is due to the acidification of the bacterial cytoplasm through the formation of hydrogen ion (H+) and F\u2212 from hydrogen fluoride and the disruption of the bacterial metabolism by inhibiting vital bacterial enzymes such as proton releasing adenosine triphosphatase and enolase.\nMoreover, the use of fluoride lowers the pH. Bacteria will thus use more energy to maintain a neutral pH. Therefore, they will have less energy left to grow, reproduce and generate acid and polysaccharides.\nThe mechanisms of fluoride oral action suggested by\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Extremely high levels of fluoride are known to cause neurotoxicity in adults, and negative impacts on memory and learning have been reported in rodent studies, but little is known about the substance\u2019s impact on children\u2019s neurodevelopment. In a meta-analysis, researchers from Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) and China Medical University in Shenyang for the first time combined 27 studies and found strong indications that fluoride may adversely affect cognitive development in children. Based on the findings, the authors say that this risk should not be ignored, and that more research on fluoride\u2019s impact on the developing brain is warranted.\nThe study was published online in Environmental Health Perspectives on July 20, 2012.\nThe researchers conducted a systematic review of studies, almost all of which are from China where risks from fluoride are well-established. Fluoride is a naturally occurring substance in groundwater, and exposures to the chemical are increased in some parts of China. Virtually no human studies in this field have been conducted in the U.S., said lead author Anna Choi, research scientist in the Department of Environmental Health at HSPH.\nEven though many of the studies on children in China differed in many ways or were incomplete, the authors consider the data compilation and joint analysis an important first step in evaluating the potential risk. \u201cFor the first time we have been able to do a comprehensive meta-analysis that has the potential for helping us plan better studies. We want to make sure that cognitive development is considered as a possible target for fluoride toxicity,\u201d Choi said.\nChoi and senior author Philippe Grandjean, adjunct professor of environmental health at HSPH, and their colleagues collated the epidemiological studies of children exposed to fluoride from drinking water. The China National Knowledge Infrastructure database also was included to locate studies published in Chinese journals. They then analyzed possible associations with IQ measures in more than 8,000 children of school age; all but one study suggested that high fluoride content in water may negatively affect cognitive development.\nThe average loss in IQ was reported as a standardized weighted mean difference of 0.45, which would be approximately equivalent to seven IQ points for commonly used IQ scores with a standard deviation of 15.* Some studies suggested that even slightly increased fluoride exposure could be toxic to the brain. Thus, children in high-fluoride areas had significantly lower IQ scores than those who lived in low-fluoride areas. The children studied were up to 14 years of age, but the investigators speculate that any toxic effect on brain development may have happened earlier, and that the brain may not be fully capable of compensating for the toxicity.\n\u201cFluoride seems to fit in with lead, mercury, and other poisons that cause chemical brain drain,\u201d Grandjean says. \u201cThe effect of each toxicant may seem small, but the combined damage on a population scale can be serious, especially because the brain power of the next generation is crucial to all of us.\u201d\n* This sentence was updated on September 5, 2012.\nRead a September 2012 statement by the authors.\n** Learn more about the IQ measurements by HSPH\u2019s Anna L.

In adults, about 50% of absorbed fluoride ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nHave a question? Ask ODS Join the ODS Email List\nThis is a fact sheet intended for health professionals. For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet.\nFluoride, a mineral, is naturally present in many foods and available as a dietary supplement. Fluoride is the ionic form of the element fluorine, and it inhibits or reverses the initiation and progression of dental caries (tooth decay) and stimulates new bone formation [1].\nSoil, water, plants, and foods contain trace amounts of fluoride. Most of the fluoride that people consume comes from fluoridated water, foods and beverages prepared with fluoridated water, and toothpaste and other dental products containing fluoride [2,3].\nApproximately 80% or more of orally ingested fluoride is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract [1]. In adults, about 50% of absorbed fluoride is retained in the body, with all but 1% stored in bones and teeth [1,3]. The other 50% is excreted in urine [1]. In young children, up to 80% of absorbed fluoride is retained because more is taken up by bones and teeth than in adults [1].\nIndividual fluoride status is not typically assessed, although fluoride concentrations can be measured in plasma, saliva, urine, bones, nails, hair, and teeth [4,5]. Criteria for adequate, high, or low levels of fluoride in the body have not been established.\nIntake recommendations for fluoride and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [1]. DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following:\nThe FNB found the data insufficient to derive EARs for fluoride. Therefore, the board established AIs for all ages using estimated intakes shown to maximize reductions in the incidence of dental caries without unwanted side effects, such as dental fluorosis, a chronic condition resulting from the consumption of too much fluoride when teeth are developing [1]. Table 1 lists the current AIs for fluoride for healthy individuals.\nBrewed tea typically contains higher levels of fluoride than most foods, depending on the type of tea and its source, because tea plants take up fluoride from soil [1,3]. Fluoride levels can range from 0.3 to 6.5 mg/L (0.07 to 1.5 mg/cup) in brewed tea made with distilled water [3].\nFluoride concentrations in breast milk are so low that they cannot always be detected; when these levels can be measured, they range from less than 0.002 to 0.01 mg/L, even when mothers live in communities with fluoridated water [3]. Fluoride concentrations in cow\u2019s milk are also very low, ranging from 0.007 to 0.086 mg/L [3]. Fluoride levels in infant formulas in the United States vary, depending on the type of formula and the fluoride content of the water used to prepare the formula [3]. The typical fluoride concentration is less than 0.2 mg/L in milk-based infant formula and 0.2 to 0.3 mg/L in soy-based infant formula (not including contributions from tap water used to prepare the formula).\nOnly trace amounts of fluoride are naturally present in most foods, and most foods not prepared with fluoridated water provide less than 0.05 mg/100 g [1,6].\nA variety of types of foods and their fluoride levels per serving are listed in Table 2.\n*Amounts of fluoride might vary by levels in the water used to prepare these foods and beverages.\nSince 1962, the U.S. Public Health Service has recommended the addition of fluoride to drinking (tap) water to reduce the risk and severity of dental caries, one of the most common chronic diseases in children [8]. Many countries around the world now adjust the fluoride concentration of community drinking water supplies to the level recommended for the prevention of dental caries [9].\nAlthough the U.S. Public Health Service recommended fluoride concentrations of 0.7 in warmer climates (where children were expected to drink more water) to 1.2 mg/L in cooler climates to prevent dental caries in 1962, it amended its recommended level in 2015 to 0.7 mg/L to maintain the ability to prevent caries while minimizing the risk of dental fluorosis [8,10]. In 1986, guidelines from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established a maximum allowable concentration of 4.0 mg/L fluoride in public drinking water systems to prevent adverse effects from fluoride exposure (such as bone disease) and a recommended maximum concentration of 2.0 mg/L to prevent dental fluorosis [3,11]. The EPA is currently reviewing this regulation [12].\nFluoridated municipal drinking water\u2014including water that people drink as well as foods and beverages prepared using municipal drinking water\u2014accounts for about 60% of fluoride intakes in the United States [3,8]. In 2020, 62.9% of the U.S. population had access to a fluoridated community water system [13]. The fluoride additives used to fluoridate drinking water in the United States are fluorosilicic acid, sodium fluorosilicate, and sodium fluoride [14]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a webpage that lists fluoride levels in tap water by county [15]. Because of differences in amounts of fluoride in groundwater, private water sources (including well water) have variable fluoride concentrations [11].\nFluoride is not typically added to bottled drinking waters. However, when fluoride is added, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) stipulates that the total amount of fluoride (added plus naturally occurring) cannot exceed 0.7 mg/L [7]. Previously allowable levels ranged from 0.8 to 1.7 mg/L. FDA notes that this rule does not apply to bottled water without added fluoride that contains fluoride naturally from its source water. The amount of fluoride contained in bottled water is not required to be listed on the product label unless the label makes a claim about the product\u2019s fluoride content [16].\nOnly a few d\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Water is the major dietary source of fluoride. The only known association with low fluoride intake is the risk of dental caries. Initially, fluoride was considered beneficial when given systemically during tooth development, but later research has shown the importance and the advantages of its topical effects in the prevention or treatment of dental caries and tooth decay. Water fluoridation was once heralded as one of the best public health achievements in the twentieth century. Since this practice is not feasible or cost effective in many regions, especially rural areas, researchers and policy makers have explored other methods of introducing fluoride to the general population such as adding fluoride to milk and table salt. Lately, major concerns about excessive fluoride intake and related toxicity were raised worldwide, leading several countries to ban fluoridation. Health-care professionals and the public need guidance regarding the debate around fluoridation. This paper reviews the different aspects of fluoridation, their effectiveness in dental caries prevention and their risks. It was performed in the PubMed and the Google Scholar databases in January 2018 without limitation as to the publication period.\nKeywords: dental caries, fluoridation, prevention, public health, toxicity\nFluoride is the ionic form of fluorine, the thirteenth most abundant element in the earth\u2019s crust. It is released into the environment naturally in both water and air. Its concentration in water is variable (1). Water is the major dietary source of fluoride. The variability in water content explains much of the variability in total fluoride intake. Other important sources of fluoride are tea, seafood that contains edible bones or shells, medicinal supplements, and fluoridated toothpastes (2). Fluoride compounds are also produced by some industrial processes that use the mineral apatite, a mixture of calcium phosphate compounds (2). Dietary fluoride is absorbed rapidly in the stomach and small intestine. One-quarter to one-third of the absorbed fluoride is taken up into calcified tissues, whereas the rest is lost in the urine (3\u20136). In bone and teeth, fluoride can displace hydroxyl ions from hydroxyapatite to produce fluorapatite or fluorohydroxyapatite. About 99% of total body fluoride is contained in bones and teeth (3), and the amount steadily increases during life. The recommended intake for fluoride is expressed as an adequate intake rather than recommended dietary allowance, because of the limited data available to determine the population needs. The adequate intake for fluoride is 0.7 mg daily for toddlers, rising to 3 mg daily for adult women and 4 mg daily for adult men. It remains unclear whether fluoride is truly essential, although fluoride may have some beneficial effects (2). Once taken up into bone, fluoride appears to increase osteoblast activity and bone density, especially in the lumbar spine (7). Fluoride has been suggested as a therapy for osteoporosis since the 1960s, but despite producing denser bone, fracture risk is not reduced. Indeed, there is some evidence that nonvertebral fractures may be increased (8). The only known association with low fluoride intake is the risk of dental caries, acting through both pre-eruptive and post-eruptive mechanisms (5). The American Dental Association strongly supports fluoridation of community drinking water supplies (4); however, strong contradictory opinions also are held (9).\nDental caries is an infectious and multifactorial disease afflicting most people in industrialized and developing countries. Fluoride reduces the incidence of dental caries and slows or reverses the progression of existing lesions (10). Although pit and fissure sealants, meticulous oral hygiene, and appropriate dietary practices contribute to caries prevention and control, the most effective and widely used approaches include fluoride use (11).\nThe first \u2018artificial\u2019 water fluoridation for caries control was introduced in 1945 and 1946 in the United States (US) and Canada, respectively, and it was expected that caries prevalence would be reduced by as much as 50% (12). The success of water fluoridation in preventing and controlling dental caries led to the development of several fluoride-containing products, including toothpaste, mouth rinse, dietary supplements, and professionally applied or prescribed gel, foam, or varnish.\nMuch of the research on the efficacy and effectiveness of individual fluoride modalities in preventing and controlling dental caries was conducted before 1980, when dental caries were more common and more severe. Several modes of fluoride use have evolved, each with its own recommended concentration, frequency of use, and dosage schedule. Simultaneously, recent resistance has been growing worldwide against fluoridation, emphasizing the possible risk of toxicity. Thus, health-care professionals and the public need guidance regarding the debate around fluoridation. This review examines the different aspects of fluoridation, their effectiveness in dental caries prevention, and their risks.\nFluoride works to control early dental caries in several ways. Due to its anticariogenic and antimicrobial properties, the fluoride ion (F\u2212) has been widely used in the treatment of dental caries. The antibacterial action of fluoride is due to the acidification of the bacterial cytoplasm through the formation of hydrogen ion (H+) and F\u2212 from hydrogen fluoride and the disruption of the bacterial metabolism by inhibiting vital bacterial enzymes such as proton releasing adenosine triphosphatase and enolase.\nMoreover, the use of fluoride lowers the pH. Bacteria will thus use more energy to maintain a neutral pH. Therefore, they will have less energy left to grow, reproduce and generate acid and polysaccharides.\nThe mechanisms of fluoride oral action suggested by\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Water is the major dietary source of fluoride. The only known association with low fluoride intake is the risk of dental caries. Initially, fluoride was considered beneficial when given systemically during tooth development, but later research has shown the importance and the advantages of its topical effects in the prevention or treatment of dental caries and tooth decay. Water fluoridation was once heralded as one of the best public health achievements in the twentieth century. Since this practice is not feasible or cost effective in many regions, especially rural areas, researchers and policy makers have explored other methods of introducing fluoride to the general population such as adding fluoride to milk and table salt. Lately, major concerns about excessive fluoride intake and related toxicity were raised worldwide, leading several countries to ban fluoridation. Health-care professionals and the public need guidance regarding the debate around fluoridation. This paper reviews the different aspects of fluoridation, their effectiveness in dental caries prevention and their risks. It was performed in the PubMed and the Google Scholar databases in January 2018 without limitation as to the publication period.\nKeywords: dental caries, fluoridation, prevention, public health, toxicity\nFluoride is the ionic form of fluorine, the thirteenth most abundant element in the earth\u2019s crust. It is released into the environment naturally in both water and air. Its concentration in water is variable (1). Water is the major dietary source of fluoride. The variability in water content explains much of the variability in total fluoride intake. Other important sources of fluoride are tea, seafood that contains edible bones or shells, medicinal supplements, and fluoridated toothpastes (2). Fluoride compounds are also produced by some industrial processes that use the mineral apatite, a mixture of calcium phosphate compounds (2). Dietary fluoride is absorbed rapidly in the stomach and small intestine. One-quarter to one-third of the absorbed fluoride is taken up into calcified tissues, whereas the rest is lost in the urine (3\u20136). In bone and teeth, fluoride can displace hydroxyl ions from hydroxyapatite to produce fluorapatite or fluorohydroxyapatite. About 99% of total body fluoride is contained in bones and teeth (3), and the amount steadily increases during life. The recommended intake for fluoride is expressed as an adequate intake rather than recommended dietary allowance, because of the limited data available to determine the population needs. The adequate intake for fluoride is 0.7 mg daily for toddlers, rising to 3 mg daily for adult women and 4 mg daily for adult men. It remains unclear whether fluoride is truly essential, although fluoride may have some beneficial effects (2). Once taken up into bone, fluoride appears to increase osteoblast activity and bone density, especially in the lumbar spine (7). Fluoride has been suggested as a therapy for osteoporosis since the 1960s, but despite producing denser bone, fracture risk is not reduced. Indeed, there is some evidence that nonvertebral fractures may be increased (8). The only known association with low fluoride intake is the risk of dental caries, acting through both pre-eruptive and post-eruptive mechanisms (5). The American Dental Association strongly supports fluoridation of community drinking water supplies (4); however, strong contradictory opinions also are held (9).\nDental caries is an infectious and multifactorial disease afflicting most people in industrialized and developing countries. Fluoride reduces the incidence of dental caries and slows or reverses the progression of existing lesions (10). Although pit and fissure sealants, meticulous oral hygiene, and appropriate dietary practices contribute to caries prevention and control, the most effective and widely used approaches include fluoride use (11).\nThe first \u2018artificial\u2019 water fluoridation for caries control was introduced in 1945 and 1946 in the United States (US) and Canada, respectively, and it was expected that caries prevalence would be reduced by as much as 50% (12). The success of water fluoridation in preventing and controlling dental caries led to the development of several fluoride-containing products, including toothpaste, mouth rinse, dietary supplements, and professionally applied or prescribed gel, foam, or varnish.\nMuch of the research on the efficacy and effectiveness of individual fluoride modalities in preventing and controlling dental caries was conducted before 1980, when dental caries were more common and more severe. Several modes of fluoride use have evolved, each with its own recommended concentration, frequency of use, and dosage schedule. Simultaneously, recent resistance has been growing worldwide against fluoridation, emphasizing the possible risk of toxicity. Thus, health-care professionals and the public need guidance regarding the debate around fluoridation. This review examines the different aspects of fluoridation, their effectiveness in dental caries prevention, and their risks.\nFluoride works to control early dental caries in several ways. Due to its anticariogenic and antimicrobial properties, the fluoride ion (F\u2212) has been widely used in the treatment of dental caries. The antibacterial action of fluoride is due to the acidification of the bacterial cytoplasm through the formation of hydrogen ion (H+) and F\u2212 from hydrogen fluoride and the disruption of the bacterial metabolism by inhibiting vital bacterial enzymes such as proton releasing adenosine triphosphatase and enolase.\nMoreover, the use of fluoride lowers the pH. Bacteria will thus use more energy to maintain a neutral pH. Therefore, they will have less energy left to grow, reproduce and generate acid and polysaccharides.\nThe mechanisms of fluoride oral action suggested by\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

There is a concern, however, that some pregnant women and children may be getting more fluoride than they need because they now get fluoride from many sources including treated public water, water-added foods and beverages, teas, toothpaste, floss, and mouthwash, and the combined total intake of fluoride may exceed safe amounts.\nTherefore, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) conducted a systematic review of the published scientific literature on the association between fluoride exposure and neurodevelopment and cognition. The NTP released their findings in a State of the Science Monograph (available below under Documents). A corresponding meta-analysis on children's IQ was published in JAMA Pediatrics on January 6, 2025 (see sidebar).\nThe NTP started this work in 2016. As with all research documents intended for publication, the NTP fluoride monograph and meta-analysis underwent rigorous scientific evaluation. The evaluation process has involved many steps. The draft fluoride monograph received critical feedback during peer-review by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM), from other external experts, and from experts in several federal health agencies. After modifications were made, additional evaluation following a rigorous scientific framework was conducted by subject matter experts organized by the NTP Board of Scientific Counselors. This document is now complete and available for reference.\nThe monograph represents a thorough review of the data, and the various interpretations of the data, to accurately reflect what we know and where additional research is needed.\nThe NTP monograph concluded, with moderate confidence, that higher levels of fluoride exposure, such as drinking water containing more than 1.5 milligrams of fluoride per liter, are associated with lower IQ in children. The NTP review was designed to evaluate total fluoride exposure from all sources and was not designed to evaluate the health effects of fluoridated drinking water alone. It is important to note that there were insufficient data to determine if the low fluoride level of 0.7 mg/L currently recommended for U.S. community water supplies has a negative effect on children\u2019s IQ. The NTP found no evidence that fluoride exposure had adverse effects on adult cognition.\nThe NTP uses 4 confidence levels - high, moderate, low, or very low - to characterize the strength of scientific evidence that associates a particular health outcome with an exposure. After evaluating studies published through October 2023, the NTP Monograph concluded there is moderate confidence in the scientific evidence that showed an association between higher levels of fluoride and lower IQ in children.\nThe determination about lower IQs in children was based primarily on epidemiology studies in non-U.S. countries such as Canada, China, India, Iran, Pakistan, and Mexico where some pregnant women, infants, and children received total fluoride exposure amounts higher than 1.5 mg fluoride/L of drinking water. The U.S. Public Health Service currently recommends 0.7 mg/L, and the World Health Organization has set a safe limit for fluoride in drinking water of 1.5 mg/L.\nAn association indicates a connection between fluoride and lower IQ; it does not prove a cause and effect. Many substances are healthy and beneficial when taken in small doses but may cause harm at high doses.

Yet, studies conducted in North America examining the safety of fluoride exposure in pregnancy were nonexistent. When a Canadian study reported that higher fluoride exposure in pregnant women was associated with lower IQ scores in young children, critics attacked the methodology of the study and discounted the significance of the results. Health authorities continued to conclude that fluoride is unequivocally safe, despite four well-conducted studies over the last 3 years consistently linking fluoride exposure in pregnancy with adverse neurodevelopmental effects in offspring. We describe the challenges of conducting fluoride research and the overt cognitive biases we have witnessed in the polarized fluoride debate. The tendency to ignore new evidence that does not conform to widespread beliefs impedes the response to early warnings about fluoride as a potential developmental neurotoxin. Evolving evidence should inspire scientists and health authorities to re-evaluate claims about the safety of fluoride, especially for the fetus and infant for whom there is no benefit.\nDo not avoid difficult areas of investigation. Take risks. If scientists exclusively choose the safe routes, avoid controversial research problems and play only minor variations of someone else\u2019s themes, they voluntarily turn themselves into technicians. Our craft will indeed be in peril.1 Herbert Needleman, MD\nMost people assume that community water fluoridation (CWF)\u2014adding fluoride to public drinking water supplies\u2014is a safe and effective way to prevent cavities. After all, it has been endorsed by public health, dental and medical organizations since it was introduced 75 years ago.2,3 Today, about three-fourths of people in the United States and one-third of Canadians have fluoride added to their drinking water.\nAfter reviewing the scientific literature, it became clear that there were growing concerns about fluoride as a developmental neurotoxin.4,5 In 2006, a report by the National Research Council (NRC)6 acknowledged that fluoride exposure may be associated with adverse cognitive and endocrine outcomes, and recommended further study, especially for vulnerable populations. One NRC panel member, Dr. Isaacson, said the report \u201cshould be a wake-up call\u201d. Yet, nearly 10 years later, not a single study had directly examined fetal exposure to fluoride in humans.\nIn many academic circles, it is a taboo to study fluoride. Dr. Phyllis Mullenix,7 former Head of the Toxicology Department at the Forsyth Dental Centre in Boston, was heavily criticized for publishing her study showing that sodium fluoride was neurotoxic to developing rats. People who questioned the safety of water fluoridation are quickly dismissed as zealots or anti-science fanatics. Indeed, some scientists dismissed our funding application with comments such as, \u201cThis study is not needed. We know that fluoride is safe\u201d. But we forged ahead; shouldn\u2019t claims about safety be based on evidence?\nIn 2015, we sought funding to investigate the safety of fluoride exposure in pregnancy. We assembled an interdisciplinary team of scientists from complementary fields including epidemiology, environmental health, neuropsychology, and dentistry\u2014knowing that diverse perspectives would be critical for minimizing conscious or unconscious biases in our investigative process. We naively expected that the public health and medical community would trust the scientific process.\nWe studied 512 mother\u2013child pairs enrolled in the MIREC (Maternal Infant Research on Environmental Contaminants) study. The families lived in six Canadian cities; 40% lived in cities with CWF. To our astonishment, we found that higher levels of fluoride in pregnant women and water concentrations were associated with a 3- to 5-point lower IQ score in their 3- to 4-year-old children.8 We thought there may be other factors at play, but this association held up after accounting for important characteristics of the study population and looking at the relationship in many different ways.\nIn August 2018, we presented our findings at an international meeting held in Ottawa. We were nervous how the results would be received by the audience, which included members from Health Canada and other public health agencies. Afterwards, someone approached me and said, \u201cCongratulations \u2013 you have just sabotaged your career before it even started\u201d. Rivka Green\nAs part of our agreement, our manuscript required approval by the MIREC Biobank before we submitted it for publication. Considering the sensitive nature of the topic, the manuscript was sent to reviewers from various divisions of public health. In over 60 pages, we responded to over 200 specific critiques. The upshot of addressing each critique was that we were able to do better science by refining our methods.\nWe submitted the manuscript to three top medical journals;two did not send it for peer review because it was \u201cof low research relevance\u201d. As we waited, we hired an independent data analyst to rerun all of the analyses for the third time. In April 2019, JAMA Pediatrics accepted our paper. We responded to several additional rounds of review by the JAMA editors until we eventually reached a compromise that reflected the strength of the evidence, as well as their implications for public health.\nOne year after that conference in Ottawa, our article was published on August 19, 2019. In only 2 months, it was viewed over 100,000 times and ranked among the top 0.0005% of research output scored by Altmetric.

Loc Do, Ph.D., co-author of the study, said factors that could impact the relationship between fluoride and IQ, such as socioeconomic status, were taken into account when determining the results.\nHe added that while there are claims water fluoridation can negatively affect children\u2019s neurodevelopment, \u201cthese results provide consistent evidence this is not the case.\u201d\n\u201cThis population-based follow-up study has provided consistent scientific evidence that early-life exposure to fluoride was not negatively associated with cognitive neurodevelopment. The findings, in combination with the current body of knowledge, provide assurance that the currently practiced [water fluoridation] programs are both effective and safe for young children,\u201d the study concludes.\nIn Australia, 89% of the population served by community water systems benefit from water fluoridated at 0.6- 1.1 mg/L. Research from studies such as the National Child Oral Health Study and Environmental Research\u2019s systematic review of water fluoridation in Australia have shown that fluoride decrease the rate of tooth decay by 26-44% in adults and children.\nThis new research is currently being reviewed by the National Fluoridation Advisory Committee, the ADA\u2019s standing panel of experts that provide advice about the safety and effectiveness of fluoride.\nThe ADA has continually advocated for community water fluoridation, highlighting the mineral\u2019s proven effectiveness in preventing tooth decay. For more than 75 years strong scientific evidence has consistently shown that fluoride is safe and beneficial, according to the ADA.\nJayanth Kumar, D.D.S., former California state dental director and National Fluoridation Advisory Committee member, said the follow-up study provided additional scientific evidence that early-life exposure to fluoride is not negatively associated with brain development.\n\u201cThe findings add to the growing body of evidence from more than a dozen studies showing that fluoride concentration relevant to community water fluoridation is safe,\u201d he said.\nFor more information on community water fluoridation, visit ADA.org/fluoride.\nGame Changer: AI-Driven Matchmaking for Practice Transitions\nElevate your career, your life and your momentum with resources and benefits from the nation\u2019s leading dental association\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

(This secondary standard is a guideline, as opposed to an enforceable regulation, but public ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nSince 1945, the use of fluoride has been a successful public health initiative for reducing dental cavities and improving general oral health of adults and children. There is a concern, however, that some pregnant women and children may be getting more fluoride than they need because they now get fluoride from many sources including treated public water, water-added foods and beverages, teas, toothpaste, floss, and mouthwash, and the combined total intake of fluoride may exceed safe amounts.\nTherefore, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) conducted a systematic review of the published scientific literature on the association between fluoride exposure and neurodevelopment and cognition. The NTP released their findings in a State of the Science Monograph (available below under Documents). A corresponding meta-analysis on children's IQ was published in JAMA Pediatrics on January 6, 2025 (see sidebar).\nThe NTP started this work in 2016. As with all research documents intended for publication, the NTP fluoride monograph and meta-analysis underwent rigorous scientific evaluation. The evaluation process has involved many steps. The draft fluoride monograph received critical feedback during peer-review by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM), from other external experts, and from experts in several federal health agencies. After modifications were made, additional evaluation following a rigorous scientific framework was conducted by subject matter experts organized by the NTP Board of Scientific Counselors. This document is now complete and available for reference.\nThe monograph represents a thorough review of the data, and the various interpretations of the data, to accurately reflect what we know and where additional research is needed.\nThe NTP monograph concluded, with moderate confidence, that higher levels of fluoride exposure, such as drinking water containing more than 1.5 milligrams of fluoride per liter, are associated with lower IQ in children. The NTP review was designed to evaluate total fluoride exposure from all sources and was not designed to evaluate the health effects of fluoridated drinking water alone. It is important to note that there were insufficient data to determine if the low fluoride level of 0.7 mg/L currently recommended for U.S. community water supplies has a negative effect on children\u2019s IQ. The NTP found no evidence that fluoride exposure had adverse effects on adult cognition.\nThe NTP uses 4 confidence levels - high, moderate, low, or very low - to characterize the strength of scientific evidence that associates a particular health outcome with an exposure. After evaluating studies published through October 2023, the NTP Monograph concluded there is moderate confidence in the scientific evidence that showed an association between higher levels of fluoride and lower IQ in children.\nThe determination about lower IQs in children was based primarily on epidemiology studies in non-U.S. countries such as Canada, China, India, Iran, Pakistan, and Mexico where some pregnant women, infants, and children received total fluoride exposure amounts higher than 1.5 mg fluoride/L of drinking water. The U.S. Public Health Service currently recommends 0.7 mg/L, and the World Health Organization has set a safe limit for fluoride in drinking water of 1.5 mg/L.\nAn association indicates a connection between fluoride and lower IQ; it does not prove a cause and effect. Many substances are healthy and beneficial when taken in small doses but may cause harm at high doses. More research is needed to better understand if there are health risks associated with low fluoride exposures. This NTP monograph may provide important information to regulatory agencies that set standards for the safe use of fluoride. It does not, and was not intended to, assess the benefits of fluoride.\nBoard of Scientific Counselors - BSC Meeting\nBoard of Scientific Counselors - BSC Meeting\nExpert Panels - Other Panels\nExpert Panels - Other Panels\nBoard of Scientific Counselors - BSC Meeting\nSupplemental materials for some events, meetings, and workshops prior to 2021 have been archived.

Fluoridation Facts \u2014 the Association\u2019s free resource on fluoridation that examines the mineral\u2019s effectiveness, safety, practice and cost-effectiveness \u2014 works to assist policymakers and the general public in making informed decisions about fluoridation. The new edition contains more than 400 references and 10 new Q&A\u2019s for a total of 69 covered over 114 pages.\nIn an ongoing series, the ADA News is delving into many questions explored in the book through conversations with experts about fluoridation information and misinformation \u2014 from overall effectiveness to whether ingesting fluoride impacts IQ, health and reproduction.\nCatherine Hayes, D.M.D., chair of the department of oral health policy and epidemiology at Harvard School of Dental Medicine, discussed whether fluoridated water causes osteosarcoma \u2014 question #33 in \"Fluoridation Facts.\"\nThe question of whether fluoridated water causes osteosarcoma, a form of bone cancer, gained traction in the 1990\u2019s when researchers, while looking at osteosarcoma, gave rats in a study exceptionally high levels of fluoride. While researchers considered the evidence to be equivocal, Dr. Hayes said, they did find a slightly higher incidence of bone cancer in those particular rats.\nAn exploratory analysis from 2006 found an increased risk for osteosarcoma in boys aged 7 exposed to fluoridated drinking water, but not consistently for girls, the ADA said. This prompted a case control study co-authored by Dr. Hayes that analyzed fluoride levels in bone samples from 137 human patients with primary osteosarcoma and bone samples from 51 patients with other malignant bone tumors who served as the control group.\n\u201cWhat was found is that there was no difference in bone fluoride concentrations in the people who had the osteosarcoma versus those who did not. And that was pretty significant because no one had really ever done that before,\u201d Dr. Hayes said.\nShe noted that researchers examined patients\u2019 residential histories and fluoride supplements. They conducted an analysis on individuals who lived in fluoridated communities versus those who did not, and found there was no difference in osteosarcoma risk. Dr. Hayes also added that osteosarcoma is already a very rare form of cancer.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence whatsoever to suggest that fluoridated water causes osteosarcoma. If it did, we would see much higher levels of osteosarcoma in the country,\u201d she said.\nFor more information on this free resource, visit ADA.org/FluoridationFacts.\nGame Changer: AI-Driven Matchmaking for Practice Transitions\nElevate your career, your life and your momentum with resources and benefits from the nation\u2019s leading dental association\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

It is released into the environment naturally in both water and air. Its concentration in water is variable (1). Water is the major dietary source of fluoride. The variability in water content explains much of the variability in total fluoride intake. Other important sources of fluoride are tea, seafood that contains edible bones or shells, medicinal supplements, and fluoridated toothpastes (2). Fluoride compounds are also produced by some industrial processes that use the mineral apatite, a mixture of calcium phosphate compounds (2). Dietary fluoride is absorbed rapidly in the stomach and small intestine. One-quarter to one-third of the absorbed fluoride is taken up into calcified tissues, whereas the rest is lost in the urine (3\u20136). In bone and teeth, fluoride can displace hydroxyl ions from hydroxyapatite to produce fluorapatite or fluorohydroxyapatite. About 99% of total body fluoride is contained in bones and teeth (3), and the amount steadily increases during life. The recommended intake for fluoride is expressed as an adequate intake rather than recommended dietary allowance, because of the limited data available to determine the population needs. The adequate intake for fluoride is 0.7 mg daily for toddlers, rising to 3 mg daily for adult women and 4 mg daily for adult men. It remains unclear whether fluoride is truly essential, although fluoride may have some beneficial effects (2). Once taken up into bone, fluoride appears to increase osteoblast activity and bone density, especially in the lumbar spine (7). Fluoride has been suggested as a therapy for osteoporosis since the 1960s, but despite producing denser bone, fracture risk is not reduced. Indeed, there is some evidence that nonvertebral fractures may be increased (8). The only known association with low fluoride intake is the risk of dental caries, acting through both pre-eruptive and post-eruptive mechanisms (5). The American Dental Association strongly supports fluoridation of community drinking water supplies (4); however, strong contradictory opinions also are held (9).\nDental caries is an infectious and multifactorial disease afflicting most people in industrialized and developing countries.

We also searched the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database, because many studies on fluoride neurotoxicity have been published in Chinese journals only. In total, we identified 27 eligible epidemiological studies with high and reference exposures, end points of IQ scores, or related cognitive function measures with means and variances for the two exposure groups. Using random-effects models, we estimated the standardized mean difference between exposed and reference groups across all studies. We conducted sensitivity analyses restricted to studies using the same outcome assessment and having drinking-water fluoride as the only exposure. We performed the Cochran test for heterogeneity between studies, Begg's funnel plot, and Egger test to assess publication bias, and conducted meta-regressions to explore sources of variation in mean differences among the studies.\nResults: The standardized weighted mean difference in IQ score between exposed and reference populations was -0.45 (95% confidence interval: -0.56, -0.35) using a random-effects model. Thus, children in high-fluoride areas had significantly lower IQ scores than those who lived in low-fluoride areas. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses also indicated inverse associations, although the substantial heterogeneity did not appear to decrease.\nConclusions: The results support the possibility of an adverse effect of high fluoride exposure on children's neurodevelopment.

Yet, studies conducted in North America examining the safety of fluoride exposure in pregnancy were nonexistent. When a Canadian study reported that higher fluoride exposure in pregnant women was associated with lower IQ scores in young children, critics attacked the methodology of the study and discounted the significance of the results. Health authorities continued to conclude that fluoride is unequivocally safe, despite four well-conducted studies over the last 3 years consistently linking fluoride exposure in pregnancy with adverse neurodevelopmental effects in offspring. We describe the challenges of conducting fluoride research and the overt cognitive biases we have witnessed in the polarized fluoride debate. The tendency to ignore new evidence that does not conform to widespread beliefs impedes the response to early warnings about fluoride as a potential developmental neurotoxin. Evolving evidence should inspire scientists and health authorities to re-evaluate claims about the safety of fluoride, especially for the fetus and infant for whom there is no benefit.\nDo not avoid difficult areas of investigation. Take risks. If scientists exclusively choose the safe routes, avoid controversial research problems and play only minor variations of someone else\u2019s themes, they voluntarily turn themselves into technicians. Our craft will indeed be in peril.1 Herbert Needleman, MD\nMost people assume that community water fluoridation (CWF)\u2014adding fluoride to public drinking water supplies\u2014is a safe and effective way to prevent cavities. After all, it has been endorsed by public health, dental and medical organizations since it was introduced 75 years ago.2,3 Today, about three-fourths of people in the United States and one-third of Canadians have fluoride added to their drinking water.\nAfter reviewing the scientific literature, it became clear that there were growing concerns about fluoride as a developmental neurotoxin.4,5 In 2006, a report by the National Research Council (NRC)6 acknowledged that fluoride exposure may be associated with adverse cognitive and endocrine outcomes, and recommended further study, especially for vulnerable populations. One NRC panel member, Dr. Isaacson, said the report \u201cshould be a wake-up call\u201d. Yet, nearly 10 years later, not a single study had directly examined fetal exposure to fluoride in humans.\nIn many academic circles, it is a taboo to study fluoride. Dr. Phyllis Mullenix,7 former Head of the Toxicology Department at the Forsyth Dental Centre in Boston, was heavily criticized for publishing her study showing that sodium fluoride was neurotoxic to developing rats. People who questioned the safety of water fluoridation are quickly dismissed as zealots or anti-science fanatics. Indeed, some scientists dismissed our funding application with comments such as, \u201cThis study is not needed. We know that fluoride is safe\u201d. But we forged ahead; shouldn\u2019t claims about safety be based on evidence?\nIn 2015, we sought funding to investigate the safety of fluoride exposure in pregnancy. We assembled an interdisciplinary team of scientists from complementary fields including epidemiology, environmental health, neuropsychology, and dentistry\u2014knowing that diverse perspectives would be critical for minimizing conscious or unconscious biases in our investigative process. We naively expected that the public health and medical community would trust the scientific process.\nWe studied 512 mother\u2013child pairs enrolled in the MIREC (Maternal Infant Research on Environmental Contaminants) study. The families lived in six Canadian cities; 40% lived in cities with CWF. To our astonishment, we found that higher levels of fluoride in pregnant women and water concentrations were associated with a 3- to 5-point lower IQ score in their 3- to 4-year-old children.8 We thought there may be other factors at play, but this association held up after accounting for important characteristics of the study population and looking at the relationship in many different ways.\nIn August 2018, we presented our findings at an international meeting held in Ottawa. We were nervous how the results would be received by the audience, which included members from Health Canada and other public health agencies. Afterwards, someone approached me and said, \u201cCongratulations \u2013 you have just sabotaged your career before it even started\u201d. Rivka Green\nAs part of our agreement, our manuscript required approval by the MIREC Biobank before we submitted it for publication. Considering the sensitive nature of the topic, the manuscript was sent to reviewers from various divisions of public health. In over 60 pages, we responded to over 200 specific critiques. The upshot of addressing each critique was that we were able to do better science by refining our methods.\nWe submitted the manuscript to three top medical journals;two did not send it for peer review because it was \u201cof low research relevance\u201d. As we waited, we hired an independent data analyst to rerun all of the analyses for the third time. In April 2019, JAMA Pediatrics accepted our paper. We responded to several additional rounds of review by the JAMA editors until we eventually reached a compromise that reflected the strength of the evidence, as well as their implications for public health.\nOne year after that conference in Ottawa, our article was published on August 19, 2019. In only 2 months, it was viewed over 100,000 times and ranked among the top 0.0005% of research output scored by Altmetric. We expected our study would reignite the debate about the safety of fluoridation, but we didn\u2019t expect we would be at the crossfire of this political and polarized debate.\nOutside of our colleagues in environmental epidemiology, who were initially skeptical, the results were m\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

There is a concern, however, that some pregnant women and children may be getting more fluoride than they need because they now get fluoride from many sources including treated public water, water-added foods and beverages, teas, toothpaste, floss, and mouthwash, and the combined total intake of fluoride may exceed safe amounts.\nTherefore, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) conducted a systematic review of the published scientific literature on the association between fluoride exposure and neurodevelopment and cognition. The NTP released their findings in a State of the Science Monograph (available below under Documents). A corresponding meta-analysis on children's IQ was published in JAMA Pediatrics on January 6, 2025 (see sidebar).\nThe NTP started this work in 2016.

Yet, studies conducted in North America examining the safety of fluoride exposure in pregnancy were nonexistent. When a Canadian study reported that higher fluoride exposure in pregnant women was associated with lower IQ scores in young children, critics attacked the methodology of the study and discounted the significance of the results. Health authorities continued to conclude that fluoride is unequivocally safe, despite four well-conducted studies over the last 3 years consistently linking fluoride exposure in pregnancy with adverse neurodevelopmental effects in offspring. We describe the challenges of conducting fluoride research and the overt cognitive biases we have witnessed in the polarized fluoride debate. The tendency to ignore new evidence that does not conform to widespread beliefs impedes the response to early warnings about fluoride as a potential developmental neurotoxin. Evolving evidence should inspire scientists and health authorities to re-evaluate claims about the safety of fluoride, especially for the fetus and infant for whom there is no benefit.\nDo not avoid difficult areas of investigation. Take risks. If scientists exclusively choose the safe routes, avoid controversial research problems and play only minor variations of someone else\u2019s themes, they voluntarily turn themselves into technicians. Our craft will indeed be in peril.1 Herbert Needleman, MD\nMost people assume that community water fluoridation (CWF)\u2014adding fluoride to public drinking water supplies\u2014is a safe and effective way to prevent cavities. After all, it has been endorsed by public health, dental and medical organizations since it was introduced 75 years ago.2,3 Today, about three-fourths of people in the United States and one-third of Canadians have fluoride added to their drinking water.\nAfter reviewing the scientific literature, it became clear that there were growing concerns about fluoride as a developmental neurotoxin.4,5 In 2006, a report by the National Research Council (NRC)6 acknowledged that fluoride exposure may be associated with adverse cognitive and endocrine outcomes, and recommended further study, especially for vulnerable populations. One NRC panel member, Dr. Isaacson, said the report \u201cshould be a wake-up call\u201d. Yet, nearly 10 years later, not a single study had directly examined fetal exposure to fluoride in humans.\nIn many academic circles, it is a taboo to study fluoride. Dr. Phyllis Mullenix,7 former Head of the Toxicology Department at the Forsyth Dental Centre in Boston, was heavily criticized for publishing her study showing that sodium fluoride was neurotoxic to developing rats. People who questioned the safety of water fluoridation are quickly dismissed as zealots or anti-science fanatics. Indeed, some scientists dismissed our funding application with comments such as, \u201cThis study is not needed. We know that fluoride is safe\u201d. But we forged ahead; shouldn\u2019t claims about safety be based on evidence?\nIn 2015, we sought funding to investigate the safety of fluoride exposure in pregnancy. We assembled an interdisciplinary team of scientists from complementary fields including epidemiology, environmental health, neuropsychology, and dentistry\u2014knowing that diverse perspectives would be critical for minimizing conscious or unconscious biases in our investigative process. We naively expected that the public health and medical community would trust the scientific process.\nWe studied 512 mother\u2013child pairs enrolled in the MIREC (Maternal Infant Research on Environmental Contaminants) study. The families lived in six Canadian cities; 40% lived in cities with CWF. To our astonishment, we found that higher levels of fluoride in pregnant women and water concentrations were associated with a 3- to 5-point lower IQ score in their 3- to 4-year-old children.8 We thought there may be other factors at play, but this association held up after accounting for important characteristics of the study population and looking at the relationship in many different ways.\nIn August 2018, we presented our findings at an international meeting held in Ottawa. We were nervous how the results would be received by the audience, which included members from Health Canada and other public health agencies. Afterwards, someone approached me and said, \u201cCongratulations \u2013 you have just sabotaged your career before it even started\u201d. Rivka Green\nAs part of our agreement, our manuscript required approval by the MIREC Biobank before we submitted it for publication. Considering the sensitive nature of the topic, the manuscript was sent to reviewers from various divisions of public health. In over 60 pages, we responded to over 200 specific critiques. The upshot of addressing each critique was that we were able to do better science by refining our methods.\nWe submitted the manuscript to three top medical journals;two did not send it for peer review because it was \u201cof low research relevance\u201d. As we waited, we hired an independent data analyst to rerun all of the analyses for the third time. In April 2019, JAMA Pediatrics accepted our paper. We responded to several additional rounds of review by the JAMA editors until we eventually reached a compromise that reflected the strength of the evidence, as well as their implications for public health.\nOne year after that conference in Ottawa, our article was published on August 19, 2019. In only 2 months, it was viewed over 100,000 times and ranked among the top 0.0005% of research output scored by Altmetric. We expected our study would reignite the debate about the safety of fluoridation, but we didn\u2019t expect we would be at the crossfire of this political and polarized debate.\nOutside of our colleagues in environmental epidemiology, who were initially skeptical, the results were m\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Kennedy, Jr.\u2019s earlier claim that adding fluoride to tap water may harm cognition.\nCiting fears that the chemical negatively affects brain development, several U.S. cities and states are either in the process of reevaluating the inclusion of fluoride in their water supply or have already moved to remove it. The new paper\u2019s findings, however, offer U.S.-based evidence that the public health intervention is safe, says University of Minnesota sociologist and study co-author John Robert Warren.\nThe new study is a \u201cmuch needed addition to a broad literature that shows the safety and benefits of community water fluoridation,\u201d says University of California, San Francisco, pediatrician Susan Fisher-Owens, who was not involved in the work. \u201cIt is the first study that looks at this information in the United States, which makes it a stronger basis for making policy decisions.\u201d\nFluoride was first added to drinking water in parts of the U.S. in 1945 to prevent tooth decay, one of the most common chronic childhood diseases. The practice, first adopted in Grand Rapids, Mich., was, in 1999, praised by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as among the greatest public health achievements of the 20th century. Today more than 62 percent of the U.S. population receives fluoridated water. Generally, U.S. water systems have 0.7 milligram of fluoride per liter of water.\nFor the new study, Warren and his colleagues analyzed data from Americans who were included in the High School and Beyond study cohort by the National Center for Education Statistics between 1980 and 2021. The data analyzed by Warren\u2019s team started with 26,820 participants in 1980, and about half of them were part of a 2021 follow-up.\nThe researchers estimated each participant\u2019s fluoride exposure from conception through 12th grade. The team then compared the participants\u2019 exposure with their standardized test scores in reading, math and vocabulary during high school, as well as with memory tests that they were given when they reached their 60s.\nMEGHA SATYANARAYANA\nSAIMA S. IQBAL\nLAUREN J. YOUNG\nCLAIRE CAMERON\nThe results showed that children who grew up taking in the recommended levels of fluoride performed slightly better on all academic measures in high school than those who were never exposed to sufficient levels. In adulthood, those same individuals who had recommended exposure showed no measurable differences in memory, attention or other cognitive skills compared with their peers, according to the study.\nAlthough the study did not examine why people who were exposed to fluoridation had higher test scores in high school, Warren hypothesizes that having better dental health as a result of fluoride may have meant those individuals were less likely to be absent from school because of illness.\n\u201cIf children are healthy, they are staying in school, and they are going to do better,\u201d Fisher-Owens agrees.\nThe study \u201cis not perfect,\u201d Warren says, because standardized test scores are not the same as an IQ test. His team is preparing to publish another study involving IQ tests that were given to a group of people that researchers have followed since the 1950s, however.\nThe study comes amid a growing debate over fluoridation in water: this year Utah\u2019s ban on fluoride in public drinking water went into effect in May, and Florida\u2019s did so in July.\nAny policy assessment needs to take into account both the benefits and potential harms of fluoridation, says epidemiologist David Savitz, who was not involved in the new study. But, he adds, the evidence that supports the benefits of fluoridation in the U.S. is stronger than the evidence that suggests potential harms.\n\u201cThe only reason we fluoridate the water is because of the benefits. If it did not have benefits, we would not do it,\u201d Savitz says.\nHUMBERTO BASILIO is a Mexican science journalist covering policy, health, misconduct, archaeology and the environment.

The study has been assessed broadly as a weak analysis.\nAmal Noureldin, Ph.D., director of predoctoral programs in the department of public health sciences at the Texas A&M University School of Dentistry, explained that fluoride is naturally found in the environment, including in the soil and water. The mineral has been added to community drinking water for years because of its tooth enamel-strengthening properties and has been shown to have very minimal risks.\nBecause the amount of fluoride present in drinking water (0.7 mg/L) is regulated, Dr. Noureldin emphasized that consuming tap water cannot cause fluoride-related toxicity. She also noted that the evidence presented in the study was reliant upon data from countries outside the United States with high naturally occurring levels of fluoride and has been widely criticized by the dental and scientific communities.\nRead more: KBTX\nThe article presented here is intended to inform you about the broader media perspective on dentistry, regardless of its alignment with the ADA's stance.

There is a concern, however, that some pregnant women and children may be getting more fluoride than they need because they now get fluoride from many sources including treated public water, water-added foods and beverages, teas, toothpaste, floss, and mouthwash, and the combined total intake of fluoride may exceed safe amounts.\nTherefore, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) conducted a systematic review of the published scientific literature on the association between fluoride exposure and neurodevelopment and cognition. The NTP released their findings in a State of the Science Monograph (available below under Documents). A corresponding meta-analysis on children's IQ was published in JAMA Pediatrics on January 6, 2025 (see sidebar).\nThe NTP started this work in 2016. As with all research documents intended for publication, the NTP fluoride monograph and meta-analysis underwent rigorous scientific evaluation. The evaluation process has involved many steps. The draft fluoride monograph received critical feedback during peer-review by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM), from other external experts, and from experts in several federal health agencies.

This document is now complete and available for reference.\nThe monograph represents a thorough review of the data, and the various interpretations of the data, to accurately reflect what we know and where additional research is needed.\nThe NTP monograph concluded, with moderate confidence, that higher levels of fluoride exposure, such as drinking water containing more than 1.5 milligrams of fluoride per liter, are associated with lower IQ in children. The NTP review was designed to evaluate total fluoride exposure from all sources and was not designed to evaluate the health effects of fluoridated drinking water alone. It is important to note that there were insufficient data to determine if the low fluoride level of 0.7 mg/L currently recommended for U.S. community water supplies has a negative effect on children\u2019s IQ. The NTP found no evidence that fluoride exposure had adverse effects on adult cognition.\nThe NTP uses 4 confidence levels - high, moderate, low, or very low - to characterize the strength of scientific evidence that associates a particular health outcome with an exposure. After evaluating studies published through October 2023, the NTP Monograph concluded there is moderate confidence in the scientific evidence that showed an association between higher levels of fluoride and lower IQ in children.\nThe determination about lower IQs in children was based primarily on epidemiology studies in non-U.S. countries such as Canada, China, India, Iran, Pakistan, and Mexico where some pregnant women, infants, and children received total fluoride exposure amounts higher than 1.5 mg fluoride/L of drinking water. The U.S. Public Health Service currently recommends 0.7 mg/L, and the World Health Organization has set a safe limit for fluoride in drinking water of 1.5 mg/L.\nAn association indicates a connection between fluoride and lower IQ; it does not prove a cause and effect. Many substances are healthy and beneficial when taken in small doses but may cause harm at high doses.

Fluoridation Facts \u2014 the Association\u2019s free resource on fluoridation that examines the mineral\u2019s effectiveness, safety, practice and cost-effectiveness \u2014 works to assist policymakers and the general public in making informed decisions about fluoridation. The new edition contains more than 400 references and 10 new Q&A\u2019s for a total of 69 covered over 114 pages.\nIn an ongoing series, the ADA News is delving into many questions explored in the book through conversations with experts about fluoridation information and misinformation \u2014 from overall effectiveness to whether ingesting fluoride impacts IQ, health and reproduction.\nCatherine Hayes, D.M.D., chair of the department of oral health policy and epidemiology at Harvard School of Dental Medicine, discussed whether fluoridated water causes osteosarcoma \u2014 question #33 in \"Fluoridation Facts.\"\nThe question of whether fluoridated water causes osteosarcoma, a form of bone cancer, gained traction in the 1990\u2019s when researchers, while looking at osteosarcoma, gave rats in a study exceptionally high levels of fluoride. While researchers considered the evidence to be equivocal, Dr. Hayes said, they did find a slightly higher incidence of bone cancer in those particular rats.\nAn exploratory analysis from 2006 found an increased risk for osteosarcoma in boys aged 7 exposed to fluoridated drinking water, but not consistently for girls, the ADA said. This prompted a case control study co-authored by Dr. Hayes that analyzed fluoride levels in bone samples from 137 human patients with primary osteosarcoma and bone samples from 51 patients with other malignant bone tumors who served as the control group.\n\u201cWhat was found is that there was no difference in bone fluoride concentrations in the people who had the osteosarcoma versus those who did not. And that was pretty significant because no one had really ever done that before,\u201d Dr. Hayes said.\nShe noted that researchers examined patients\u2019 residential histories and fluoride supplements. They conducted an analysis on individuals who lived in fluoridated communities versus those who did not, and found there was no difference in osteosarcoma risk. Dr. Hayes also added that osteosarcoma is already a very rare form of cancer.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence whatsoever to suggest that fluoridated water causes osteosarcoma. If it did, we would see much higher levels of osteosarcoma in the country,\u201d she said.\nFor more information on this free resource, visit ADA.org/FluoridationFacts.\nGame Changer: AI-Driven Matchmaking for Practice Transitions\nElevate your career, your life and your momentum with resources and benefits from the nation\u2019s leading dental association\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet.\nFluoride, a mineral, is naturally present in many foods and available as a dietary supplement. Fluoride is the ionic form of the element fluorine, and it inhibits or reverses the initiation and progression of dental caries (tooth decay) and stimulates new bone formation [1].\nSoil, water, plants, and foods contain trace amounts of fluoride. Most of the fluoride that people consume comes from fluoridated water, foods and beverages prepared with fluoridated water, and toothpaste and other dental products containing fluoride [2,3].\nApproximately 80% or more of orally ingested fluoride is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract [1]. In adults, about 50% of absorbed fluoride is retained in the body, with all but 1% stored in bones and teeth [1,3]. The other 50% is excreted in urine [1]. In young children, up to 80% of absorbed fluoride is retained because more is taken up by bones and teeth than in adults [1].\nIndividual fluoride status is not typically assessed, although fluoride concentrations can be measured in plasma, saliva, urine, bones, nails, hair, and teeth [4,5]. Criteria for adequate, high, or low levels of fluoride in the body have not been established.\nIntake recommendations for fluoride and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [1]. DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following:\nThe FNB found the data insufficient to derive EARs for fluoride. Therefore, the board established AIs for all ages using estimated intakes shown to maximize reductions in the incidence of dental caries without unwanted side effects, such as dental fluorosis, a chronic condition resulting from the consumption of too much fluoride when teeth are developing [1]. Table 1 lists the current AIs for fluoride for healthy individuals.\nBrewed tea typically contains higher levels of fluoride than most foods, depending on the type of tea and its source, because tea plants take up fluoride from soil [1,3]. Fluoride levels can range from 0.3 to 6.5 mg/L (0.07 to 1.5 mg/cup) in brewed tea made with distilled water [3].\nFluoride concentrations in breast milk are so low that they cannot always be detected; when these levels can be measured, they range from less than 0.002 to 0.01 mg/L, even when mothers live in communities with fluoridated water [3]. Fluoride concentrations in cow\u2019s milk are also very low, ranging from 0.007 to 0.086 mg/L [3]. Fluoride levels in infant formulas in the United States vary, depending on the type of formula and the fluoride content of the water used to prepare the formula [3]. The typical fluoride concentration is less than 0.2 mg/L in milk-based infant formula and 0.2 to 0.3 mg/L in soy-based infant formula (not including contributions from tap water used to prepare the formula).\nOnly trace amounts of fluoride are naturally present in most foods, and most foods not prepared with fluoridated water provide less than 0.05 mg/100 g [1,6].\nA variety of types of foods and their fluoride levels per serving are listed in Table 2.\n*Amounts of fluoride might vary by levels in the water used to prepare these foods and beverages.\nSince 1962, the U.S. Public Health Service has recommended the addition of fluoride to drinking (tap) water to reduce the risk and severity of dental caries, one of the most common chronic diseases in children [8]. Many countries around the world now adjust the fluoride concentration of community drinking water supplies to the level recommended for the prevention of dental caries [9].\nAlthough the U.S. Public Health Service recommended fluoride concentrations of 0.7 in warmer climates (where children were expected to drink more water) to 1.2 mg/L in cooler climates to prevent dental caries in 1962, it amended its recommended level in 2015 to 0.7 mg/L to maintain the ability to prevent caries while minimizing the risk of dental fluorosis [8,10]. In 1986, guidelines from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established a maximum allowable concentration of 4.0 mg/L fluoride in public drinking water systems to prevent adverse effects from fluoride exposure (such as bone disease) and a recommended maximum concentration of 2.0 mg/L to prevent dental fluorosis [3,11]. The EPA is currently reviewing this regulation [12].\nFluoridated municipal drinking water\u2014including water that people drink as well as foods and beverages prepared using municipal drinking water\u2014accounts for about 60% of fluoride intakes in the United States [3,8]. In 2020, 62.9% of the U.S. population had access to a fluoridated community water system [13]. The fluoride additives used to fluoridate drinking water in the United States are fluorosilicic acid, sodium fluorosilicate, and sodium fluoride [14]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a webpage that lists fluoride levels in tap water by county [15]. Because of differences in amounts of fluoride in groundwater, private water sources (including well water) have variable fluoride concentrations [11].\nFluoride is not typically added to bottled drinking waters. However, when fluoride is added, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) stipulates that the total amount of fluoride (added plus naturally occurring) cannot exceed 0.7 mg/L [7]. Previously allowable levels ranged from 0.8 to 1.7 mg/L. FDA notes that this rule does not apply to bottled water without added fluoride that contains fluoride naturally from its source water. The amount of fluoride contained in bottled water is not required to be listed on the product label unless the label makes a claim about the product\u2019s fluoride content [16].\nOnly a few d\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

The report didn' ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nSince 1945, the use of fluoride has been a successful public health initiative for reducing dental cavities and improving general oral health of adults and children. There is a concern, however, that some pregnant women and children may be getting more fluoride than they need because they now get fluoride from many sources including treated public water, water-added foods and beverages, teas, toothpaste, floss, and mouthwash, and the combined total intake of fluoride may exceed safe amounts.\nTherefore, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) conducted a systematic review of the published scientific literature on the association between fluoride exposure and neurodevelopment and cognition. The NTP released their findings in a State of the Science Monograph (available below under Documents). A corresponding meta-analysis on children's IQ was published in JAMA Pediatrics on January 6, 2025 (see sidebar).\nThe NTP started this work in 2016. As with all research documents intended for publication, the NTP fluoride monograph and meta-analysis underwent rigorous scientific evaluation. The evaluation process has involved many steps. The draft fluoride monograph received critical feedback during peer-review by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM), from other external experts, and from experts in several federal health agencies. After modifications were made, additional evaluation following a rigorous scientific framework was conducted by subject matter experts organized by the NTP Board of Scientific Counselors. This document is now complete and available for reference.\nThe monograph represents a thorough review of the data, and the various interpretations of the data, to accurately reflect what we know and where additional research is needed.\nThe NTP monograph concluded, with moderate confidence, that higher levels of fluoride exposure, such as drinking water containing more than 1.5 milligrams of fluoride per liter, are associated with lower IQ in children. The NTP review was designed to evaluate total fluoride exposure from all sources and was not designed to evaluate the health effects of fluoridated drinking water alone. It is important to note that there were insufficient data to determine if the low fluoride level of 0.7 mg/L currently recommended for U.S. community water supplies has a negative effect on children\u2019s IQ. The NTP found no evidence that fluoride exposure had adverse effects on adult cognition.\nThe NTP uses 4 confidence levels - high, moderate, low, or very low - to characterize the strength of scientific evidence that associates a particular health outcome with an exposure. After evaluating studies published through October 2023, the NTP Monograph concluded there is moderate confidence in the scientific evidence that showed an association between higher levels of fluoride and lower IQ in children.\nThe determination about lower IQs in children was based primarily on epidemiology studies in non-U.S. countries such as Canada, China, India, Iran, Pakistan, and Mexico where some pregnant women, infants, and children received total fluoride exposure amounts higher than 1.5 mg fluoride/L of drinking water. The U.S. Public Health Service currently recommends 0.7 mg/L, and the World Health Organization has set a safe limit for fluoride in drinking water of 1.5 mg/L.\nAn association indicates a connection between fluoride and lower IQ; it does not prove a cause and effect. Many substances are healthy and beneficial when taken in small doses but may cause harm at high doses. More research is needed to better understand if there are health risks associated with low fluoride exposures. This NTP monograph may provide important information to regulatory agencies that set standards for the safe use of fluoride. It does not, and was not intended to, assess the benefits of fluoride.\nBoard of Scientific Counselors - BSC Meeting\nBoard of Scientific Counselors - BSC Meeting\nExpert Panels - Other Panels\nExpert Panels - Other Panels\nBoard of Scientific Counselors - BSC Meeting\nSupplemental materials for some events, meetings, and workshops prior to 2021 have been archived.

One NRC panel member, Dr. Isaacson, said the report \u201cshould be a wake-up call\u201d. Yet, nearly 10 years later, not a single study had directly examined fetal exposure to fluoride in humans.\nIn many academic circles, it is a taboo to study fluoride. Dr. Phyllis Mullenix,7 former Head of the Toxicology Department at the Forsyth Dental Centre in Boston, was heavily criticized for publishing her study showing that sodium fluoride was neurotoxic to developing rats. People who questioned the safety of water fluoridation are quickly dismissed as zealots or anti-science fanatics. Indeed, some scientists dismissed our funding application with comments such as, \u201cThis study is not needed. We know that fluoride is safe\u201d. But we forged ahead; shouldn\u2019t claims about safety be based on evidence?\nIn 2015, we sought funding to investigate the safety of fluoride exposure in pregnancy. We assembled an interdisciplinary team of scientists from complementary fields including epidemiology, environmental health, neuropsychology, and dentistry\u2014knowing that diverse perspectives would be critical for minimizing conscious or unconscious biases in our investigative process. We naively expected that the public health and medical community would trust the scientific process.\nWe studied 512 mother\u2013child pairs enrolled in the MIREC (Maternal Infant Research on Environmental Contaminants) study. The families lived in six Canadian cities; 40% lived in cities with CWF. To our astonishment, we found that higher levels of fluoride in pregnant women and water concentrations were associated with a 3- to 5-point lower IQ score in their 3- to 4-year-old children.8 We thought there may be other factors at play, but this association held up after accounting for important characteristics of the study population and looking at the relationship in many different ways.\nIn August 2018, we presented our findings at an international meeting held in Ottawa. We were nervous how the results would be received by the audience, which included members from Health Canada and other public health agencies. Afterwards, someone approached me and said, \u201cCongratulations \u2013 you have just sabotaged your career before it even started\u201d. Rivka Green\nAs part of our agreement, our manuscript required approval by the MIREC Biobank before we submitted it for publication. Considering the sensitive nature of the topic, the manuscript was sent to reviewers from various divisions of public health. In over 60 pages, we responded to over 200 specific critiques. The upshot of addressing each critique was that we were able to do better science by refining our methods.\nWe submitted the manuscript to three top medical journals;two did not send it for peer review because it was \u201cof low research relevance\u201d. As we waited, we hired an independent data analyst to rerun all of the analyses for the third time. In April 2019, JAMA Pediatrics accepted our paper. We responded to several additional rounds of review by the JAMA editors until we eventually reached a compromise that reflected the strength of the evidence, as well as their implications for public health.\nOne year after that conference in Ottawa, our article was published on August 19, 2019. In only 2 months, it was viewed over 100,000 times and ranked among the top 0.0005% of research output scored by Altmetric. We expected our study would reignite the debate about the safety of fluoridation, but we didn\u2019t expect we would be at the crossfire of this political and polarized debate.\nOutside of our colleagues in environmental epidemiology, who were initially skeptical, the results were m\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Many substances are healthy and beneficial when taken ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nSince 1945, the use of fluoride has been a successful public health initiative for reducing dental cavities and improving general oral health of adults and children. There is a concern, however, that some pregnant women and children may be getting more fluoride than they need because they now get fluoride from many sources including treated public water, water-added foods and beverages, teas, toothpaste, floss, and mouthwash, and the combined total intake of fluoride may exceed safe amounts.\nTherefore, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) conducted a systematic review of the published scientific literature on the association between fluoride exposure and neurodevelopment and cognition. The NTP released their findings in a State of the Science Monograph (available below under Documents). A corresponding meta-analysis on children's IQ was published in JAMA Pediatrics on January 6, 2025 (see sidebar).\nThe NTP started this work in 2016. As with all research documents intended for publication, the NTP fluoride monograph and meta-analysis underwent rigorous scientific evaluation. The evaluation process has involved many steps. The draft fluoride monograph received critical feedback during peer-review by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM), from other external experts, and from experts in several federal health agencies. After modifications were made, additional evaluation following a rigorous scientific framework was conducted by subject matter experts organized by the NTP Board of Scientific Counselors. This document is now complete and available for reference.\nThe monograph represents a thorough review of the data, and the various interpretations of the data, to accurately reflect what we know and where additional research is needed.\nThe NTP monograph concluded, with moderate confidence, that higher levels of fluoride exposure, such as drinking water containing more than 1.5 milligrams of fluoride per liter, are associated with lower IQ in children. The NTP review was designed to evaluate total fluoride exposure from all sources and was not designed to evaluate the health effects of fluoridated drinking water alone. It is important to note that there were insufficient data to determine if the low fluoride level of 0.7 mg/L currently recommended for U.S. community water supplies has a negative effect on children\u2019s IQ. The NTP found no evidence that fluoride exposure had adverse effects on adult cognition.\nThe NTP uses 4 confidence levels - high, moderate, low, or very low - to characterize the strength of scientific evidence that associates a particular health outcome with an exposure. After evaluating studies published through October 2023, the NTP Monograph concluded there is moderate confidence in the scientific evidence that showed an association between higher levels of fluoride and lower IQ in children.\nThe determination about lower IQs in children was based primarily on epidemiology studies in non-U.S. countries such as Canada, China, India, Iran, Pakistan, and Mexico where some pregnant women, infants, and children received total fluoride exposure amounts higher than 1.5 mg fluoride/L of drinking water. The U.S. Public Health Service currently recommends 0.7 mg/L, and the World Health Organization has set a safe limit for fluoride in drinking water of 1.5 mg/L.\nAn association indicates a connection between fluoride and lower IQ; it does not prove a cause and effect. Many substances are healthy and beneficial when taken in small doses but may cause harm at high doses. More research is needed to better understand if there are health risks associated with low fluoride exposures. This NTP monograph may provide important information to regulatory agencies that set standards for the safe use of fluoride. It does not, and was not intended to, assess the benefits of fluoride.\nBoard of Scientific Counselors - BSC Meeting\nBoard of Scientific Counselors - BSC Meeting\nExpert Panels - Other Panels\nExpert Panels - Other Panels\nBoard of Scientific Counselors - BSC Meeting\nSupplemental materials for some events, meetings, and workshops prior to 2021 have been archived.

A total of 721 children from rural Jiangsu, China, were included in the study and divided into two groups based on the fluoride concentration in their drinking water: a high fluoride group (HF) and a control group (CONTROL). Ion-selective electrode technology was used to assess the amount of fluoride in urine and drinking water. The Combined Raven's Test (CRT-RC2) was used to assess the IQ levels of the children. Generalized linear and multiple logistic regression models were used to examine the association between fluorine exposure and intelligence level ratings. The HF group exhibited lower average IQ scores than the CONTROL group, with a statistically significant difference among the groups (P < 0.001). The proportion of individuals with Dull normal and below of IQ in the HF group was significantly higher than that in the CONTROL group (15.0 vs 3.1%), moreover in children with dental fluorosis (DF) was significantly higher than that in children without it (21.8 vs 4.4%), in children with excessive urinary fluoride (UF) was significantly higher than that in children with normal UF (16.5 vs 1.7%); these distributions were significantly different (P < 0.001, P = 0.048, P < 0.001, respectively). Furthermore, the risk of below normal IQ in children from the HF group was significantly elevated compared to CONTROL children with a normal intelligence quotient, with an adjusted OR of 6.81 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.20, 14.48). Urinary fluoride (UF) was inversely linked with IQ scores, with an adjusted coefficient (\u03b2) of \u22124.08 (95% CI \u22123.04, \u22121.32). The coefficient of UF in the HF group was statistically different from that in the CONTROL group (P < 0.001). Excessive exposure to fluorine has severe negative effects on the intellectual development of children. It is necessary to monitor children's urinary fluoride levels and investigate other sources of fluoride intake.\n10.1007/s12403-023-00597-2\nadshelp[at]cfa.harvard.edu\nThe ADS is operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory under NASA Cooperative Agreement 80NSSC21M0056\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

A total of 721 children from rural Jiangsu, China, were included in the study and divided into two groups based on the fluoride concentration in their drinking water: a high fluoride group (HF) and a control group (CONTROL). Ion-selective electrode technology was used to assess the amount of fluoride in urine and drinking water. The Combined Raven's Test (CRT-RC2) was used to assess the IQ levels of the children. Generalized linear and multiple logistic regression models were used to examine the association between fluorine exposure and intelligence level ratings. The HF group exhibited lower average IQ scores than the CONTROL group, with a statistically significant difference among the groups (P < 0.001). The proportion of individuals with Dull normal and below of IQ in the HF group was significantly higher than that in the CONTROL group (15.0 vs 3.1%), moreover in children with dental fluorosis (DF) was significantly higher than that in children without it (21.8 vs 4.4%), in children with excessive urinary fluoride (UF) was significantly higher than that in children with normal UF (16.5 vs 1.7%); these distributions were significantly different (P < 0.001, P = 0.048, P < 0.001, respectively). Furthermore, the risk of below normal IQ in children from the HF group was significantly elevated compared to CONTROL children with a normal intelligence quotient, with an adjusted OR of 6.81 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.20, 14.48).

AskAdvisory\nDaily Briefing\nAccording to a new analysis published in JAMA Pediatric, high levels of fluoride exposure were associated with lower IQs in children \u2014 findings that add to the ongoing debate about fluoride's potential harms and whether they outweigh its benefits.\nConnecting social determinants of health with medical outcomes\nFluoride has been added to tap water in many U.S. communities for almost 80 years and is credited with helping protect against cavities and tooth decay. According to CDC, research shows that community water fluoridation reduces cavities by roughly 25%.\nHowever, there has been growing debate about the benefits of fluoride and whether it could negatively impact children's IQs.\nIn August, NIH's National Toxicology Program released a report that found that drinking water with more than 1.5 milligrams of fluoride per liter is associated with lower IQs in children. Although this level of fluoridation is more than twice the recommended level of 0.7 milligrams per liter set by federal health officials, almost 3 million Americans currently drink water with fluoride levels above 1.5 mg/L from wells and some community water systems.\nRecently, federal researchers published the analysis behind this report in JAMA Pediatrics. In the analysis, researchers assessed 74 studies from 10 countries, including China, Mexico, Canada, India, and Denmark.\nAccording to the analysis, for every one part per million increase in fluoride in urinary samples, which is used to determine total exposures from water and other sources, children's IQ points decreased by 1.63. There was also evidence of a dose-response relationship in countries with much higher fluoridation levels than the United States, with IQ scores decreasing as fluoride exposure increased.\n\"There is concern that pregnant women and children are getting fluoride from many sources, and that their total fluoride exposure is too high and may affect fetal, infant and child neurodevelopment,\" said Kyla Taylor, an epidemiologist at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and the study's lead author.\nHowever, the study was unable to conclusively determine the effects of fluoridation below 1.5 mg/L, including the United States' currently recommended level of 0.7 mg/L.\n\"There were not enough data to determine if 0.7 mg/L of fluoride exposure in drinking water affected children's IQ,\" said Christine Flowers, director of NIH's Office of Communication.\nNotably, Taylor said that while the analysis was intended to help better understand the safe and effective use of fluoride, it did not address the benefits and was not designed to assess \"the broader public health implications of water fluoridation in the United States.\"\nSo far, responses to the study's findings have been divided, with JAMA Pediatrics publishing two opposing editorials alongside the study.\nIn one editorial, Steven Levy, a public health dentist at the University of Iowa, criticized the study's methods and disagreed with its findings.\n\"The major problem is that the science is not as strong as it's presented by these authors,\" Levy said. He also noted that more recent fluoride studies, which he believes are better designed and should have been given more weight in the study, have found no negative effects of fluoride on IQ.\n\"The people who are proposing fluoridation need to now prove it's safe.\"\nIn the second editorial, three children's health researchers argued that the study makes a strong enough case for taking action on fluoride, even if the evidence is imperfect. \"What the study does, or should do, is shift the burden of proof,\" said Bruce Lanphear, a children's health researcher from Simon Fraser University and one of the editorial's authors. \"The people who are proposing fluoridation need to now prove it's safe.\"\nLanphear has also urged the U.S. Public Health Service to set up a committee to examine whether fluoride is neurotoxic and as beneficial to oral health as it is currently believed to be. \"If that doesn't happen urgently, my concern is there will be growing distrust of public health agencies amid the public, and they will have deserved it,\" he said.\nIn general, there has been growing interest in regulating fluoride levels. For example, U.S. District Judge Edward Chen in September ruled in favor of several advocacy groups, finding that the current practice of adding fluoride to drinking water could lead to unreasonable health risks for children's developing brains, and ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to strengthen its regulations for fluoride in drinking water.\nRobert F. Kennedy, Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for HHS secretary, has also spoken out against fluoride in public drinking water, saying that it is \"an industrial waste associated with arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss, neurodevelopmental disorders and thyroid disease.\" \"I am going to advise the water districts about their legal liability, their legal obligations, their service to their constituents, and I'm going to give them good information on the science and fluoride will disappear,\" Kennedy said.\nFor more information on social determinants of health (SDOH) and how they can impact patients, check out these resources:\nSo far, it's unclear how much of an effect the Trump administration could have on changing current regulations on fluoridation, particularly since the power to regulate fluoride in drinking water falls to the states and not the federal government.\nHowever, Lawrence Gostin, a global health law professor at Georgetown University Law Center, said the Trump administration could pressure states to ban fluoride and encourage local opposition to fluoridation.\n(Rabin, New York Times, 1/8; Huang, \"Shots,\" NPR, 1/9)\nPosted on January 13, 2025\nUpdated on January 13, 2025\nWe help leaders and future leaders in the healthcare industry work smarter and faster by providing provocative insights, actionable strategies, and practical tools\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

He also noted that more recent fluoride studies, which he believes are better designed and should have been given more weight in the study, have found no negative effects of fluoride on IQ.\n\"The people who are proposing fluoridation need to now prove it's safe.\"\nIn the second editorial, three children's health researchers argued that the study makes a strong enough case for taking action on fluoride, even if the evidence is imperfect. \"What the study does, or should do, is shift the burden of proof,\" said Bruce Lanphear, a children's health researcher from Simon Fraser University and one of the editorial's authors. \"The people who are proposing fluoridation need to now prove it's safe.\"\nLanphear has also urged the U.S. Public Health Service to set up a committee to examine whether fluoride is neurotoxic and as beneficial to oral health as it is currently believed to be. \"If that doesn't happen urgently, my concern is there will be growing distrust of public health agencies amid the public, and they will have deserved it,\" he said.\nIn general, there has been growing interest in regulating fluoride levels. For example, U.S. District Judge Edward Chen in September ruled in favor of several advocacy groups, finding that the current practice of adding fluoride to drinking water could lead to unreasonable health risks for children's developing brains, and ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to strengthen its regulations for fluoride in drinking water.\nRobert F. Kennedy, Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for HHS secretary, has also spoken out against fluoride in public drinking water, saying that it is \"an industrial waste associated with arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss, neurodevelopmental disorders and thyroid disease.\" \"I am going to advise the water districts about their legal liability, their legal obligations, their service to their constituents, and I'm going to give them good information on the science and fluoride will disappear,\" Kennedy said.\nFor more information on social determinants of health (SDOH) and how they can impact patients, check out these resources:\nSo far, it's unclear how much of an effect the Trump administration could have on changing current regulations on fluoridation, particularly since the power to regulate fluoride in drinking water falls to the states and not the federal government.\nHowever, Lawrence Gostin, a global health law professor at Georgetown University Law Center, said the Trump administration could pressure states to ban fluoride and encourage local opposition to fluoridation.\n(Rabin, New York Times, 1/8; Huang, \"Shots,\" NPR, 1/9)\nPosted on January 13, 2025\nUpdated on January 13, 2025\nWe help leaders and future leaders in the healthcare industry work smarter and faster by providing provocative insights, actionable strategies, and practical tools\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

AskAdvisory\nDaily Briefing\nAccording to a new analysis published in JAMA Pediatric, high levels of fluoride exposure were associated with lower IQs in children \u2014 findings that add to the ongoing debate about fluoride's potential harms and whether they outweigh its benefits.\nConnecting social determinants of health with medical outcomes\nFluoride has been added to tap water in many U.S. communities for almost 80 years and is credited with helping protect against cavities and tooth decay. According to CDC, research shows that community water fluoridation reduces cavities by roughly 25%.\nHowever, there has been growing debate about the benefits of fluoride and whether it could negatively impact children's IQs.\nIn August, NIH's National Toxicology Program released a report that found that drinking water with more than 1.5 milligrams of fluoride per liter is associated with lower IQs in children. Although this level of fluoridation is more than twice the recommended level of 0.7 milligrams per liter set by federal health officials, almost 3 million Americans currently drink water with fluoride levels above 1.5 mg/L from wells and some community water systems.\nRecently, federal researchers published the analysis behind this report in JAMA Pediatrics. In the analysis, researchers assessed 74 studies from 10 countries, including China, Mexico, Canada, India, and Denmark.\nAccording to the analysis, for every one part per million increase in fluoride in urinary samples, which is used to determine total exposures from water and other sources, children's IQ points decreased by 1.63.
