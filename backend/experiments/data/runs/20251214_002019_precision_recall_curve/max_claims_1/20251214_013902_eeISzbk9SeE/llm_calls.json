(IPCC)\nUnder the Paris Agreement, countries agreed to substantially reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to enable the long-term global average surface temperature increase to be kept well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5\u00b0C.(Paris Agreement)\nCountries have emphasized that the impacts of climate change would be much lower at a temperature increase of 1.5\u00b0C, compared with 2\u00b0C, and expressed their firm resolve to pursue efforts to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C.(COP outcomes; IPCC)\nMonthly and annual breaches of 1.5\u00b0C do not mean that the world has failed to achieve the Paris Agreement\u2019s temperature goal, which refers to a long-term temperature increase over decades, not individual months or years. Temperatures for any single month or year fluctuate due to natural variability, including El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a and volcanic eruptions. Consequently, long-term temperature changes are typically considered on decadal timescales. (WMO)\nThe year 2024 was the warmest year in the 175-year observational record, with a global mean near-surface temperature 1.55\u00b0C above the 1850\u20131900 average.\nNevertheless, breaches of 1.5\u00b0C for a month or a year are early signs of getting perilously close to exceeding the long-term limit, and serve as clarion calls for increasing ambition and accelerating action in this critical decade. (UNEP).\nGlobal temperature changes are typically measured against the average temperature over a historical, pre-industrial baseline of 1850\u20131900. This baseline is the earliest period for which high-quality observations of surface temperatures over the land and ocean are available. (IPCC).\nThe first months with an average temperature that was more than 1.5\u00b0C above the pre-industrial average occurred during 2015-16, driven by both human-caused climate change and a strong, naturally occurring El Ni\u00f1o. The latter part of 2023 and early 2024 also experienced monthly average global temperature anomalies above 1.5\u00b0C. (WMO)\nThe first 12-month period to exceed 1.5\u00b0C as an average was February 2023 \u2013 January 2024, boosted by El Ni\u00f1o, when the average temperature worldwide was estimated to be 1.52\u00b0C higher than 1850\u20131900, according to one scientific dataset (Copernicus Climate Change Service). The likelihood of the annual average global temperature exceeding 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels for at least one year over the coming five years has increased significantly since 2015, when it was close to zero (WMO).\nThe global average temperature for the most recent 10-year period, from 2015 to 2024, is estimated to be the warmest 10-year period on record, at around 1.24 to 1.28\u00b0C above the 1850-1900 average (EEA). The 20-year average warming for 2001\u20132020 relative to 1850\u20131900 is 0.99\u00b0C (IPCC).\nEvery fraction of a degree of warming matters. With every additional increment of global warming, changes in extremes and risks become larger. For example, every additional 0.1\u00b0C of global warming causes clearly discernible increases in the intensity and frequency of temperature and precipitation extremes, as well as agricultural and ecological droughts in some regions. (IPCC)\nLimiting global warming to below 1.5\u00b0C will significantly reduce the risks, adverse impacts, and related losses and damages from climate change. Failing to do so will lead to increasingly frequent and dangerous extreme weather events including heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, and heavy precipitation and flooding (IPCC). Extreme heat causes the greatest mortality of all extreme weather, with an estimated 489,000 heat-related deaths per year between 2000 and 2019 (WMO). Exceeding 1.5\u00b0C could also trigger multiple climate tipping points \u2014 such as breakdowns of major ocean circulation systems, abrupt thawing of boreal permafrost, and collapse of tropical coral reef systems \u2014 with abrupt, irreversible, and dangerous impacts for humanity.(Science)\nEven at current levels of global warming, we are already seeing devastating climate impacts, including intensifying extreme weather events, alarming reductions in ice sheets, sea ice, and glaciers, and several mass coral bleaching events, with widespread harms to people, economies, and nature (IPCC). In the last two decades, the 55 most climate-vulnerable economies alone have already experienced climate damages exceeding US$ 500 billion (UNEP). In 2024, disasters triggered a record 45.8 million internal displacements, of which 99.5 per cent were caused by weather-related hazards such as floods, storms, wildfires and droughts (UNDRR).\nHuman health impacts from climate change have been apparent for at least 20 years, but the climate crisis is still not treated like other global public health emergencies. Between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year from undernutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress alone. The cumulative death toll will likely be much higher, as climate change acts as a threat multiplier of many other extreme weather events and public health risks. (WHO)\nMany climate impacts, especially sea-level rise from ice sheets, disappearance of mountain glaciers, and ocean acidification, are essentially permanent for many generations to come and will take centuries to thousands of years to restore to even today\u2019s conditions. To minimize losses and damages, it is crucial to minimize the magnitude and duration of temporarily exceeding 1.5\u00b0C by urgently and significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions and phasing out fossil fuels. (New insights; IPCC)\nUnder global modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C with no or limited temporary overshoot, global greenhouse gas emissions peak by 2025, and are reduced by 43% by 2030 relative to 2019. carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reach net zero by 2050.

The meaning of the 1.5-C climate threshold\n\nGoogle Search Snippet:\nGlobal average temperature was more than 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than the pre-industrial average for several months in late 2023.\n\nFull Page Content:\nThis website is an ARCHIVED version of NOAA Climate.gov as of June 25, 2025. Content is not being updated or maintained, and some links may no longer work.\nNumbers and the meanings we attach to them can be weird. A number can mean a lot or very little depending on how it is being used, and who is using it. To a Taylor Swift fan, 13 is a lucky number. To many in Western cultures, it is a day of bad luck when falling on a Friday. To others, 13 is just the number that comes after 12. When it comes to climate science and policy, one of our \u201c13s\u201d is the 1.5\u00b0C climate threshold, shorthand for global average surface warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures. That\u2019s the level of warming that the countries who signed the Paris Agreement have agreed to try to stay below. But what does pre-industrial mean? How do we know when we\u2019ve passed 1.5\u00b0C? And what happens if we do?\nThe Industrial Revolution transformed the textile industry in England. This engraving by Edward Goodall (1795-1870), originally titled \"Manchester, from Kersal Moor,\" after a painting of W. Wylde, shows numerous industrial chimneys in the town of Manchester, England, which earned the nickname \"Cottonopolis,\" following its transformation. Image in the public domain, from Wikimedia.\nWhen you read or hear climate numbers, they are often being compared to average. The September 2023 NOAA global surface temperatures, for instance, were 1.44 degrees Celsius above average. That average represents a defined period of time. In this case, September was 1.44\u00b0C warmer than the average September of the twentieth century.\nFor the 1.5\u00b0C climate threshold, the \u201caverage\u201d time range is defined as the \u201cpre-industrial period\u201d, or the period of time before the increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases due to human-emissions began to significantly influence global temperatures. Sounds a bit vague, right? What years make up this \u201cpre-industrial period?\u201d It depends.\nMost history books define the dates of the Industrial Revolution as between the mid-1700s and mid-1800s, but scientific definitions of pre-industrial typically cover some range of decades between 1850 and 1900. Why? Because that\u2019s the earliest time period with widespread, consistent surface temperature records. Different research groups use different parts of the broader time range.

(IPCC)\nUnder the Paris Agreement, countries agreed to substantially reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to enable the long-term global average surface temperature increase to be kept well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5\u00b0C.(Paris Agreement)\nCountries have emphasized that the impacts of climate change would be much lower at a temperature increase of 1.5\u00b0C, compared with 2\u00b0C, and expressed their firm resolve to pursue efforts to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C.(COP outcomes; IPCC)\nMonthly and annual breaches of 1.5\u00b0C do not mean that the world has failed to achieve the Paris Agreement\u2019s temperature goal, which refers to a long-term temperature increase over decades, not individual months or years. Temperatures for any single month or year fluctuate due to natural variability, including El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a and volcanic eruptions. Consequently, long-term temperature changes are typically considered on decadal timescales. (WMO)\nThe year 2024 was the warmest year in the 175-year observational record, with a global mean near-surface temperature 1.55\u00b0C above the 1850\u20131900 average.\nNevertheless, breaches of 1.5\u00b0C for a month or a year are early signs of getting perilously close to exceeding the long-term limit, and serve as clarion calls for increasing ambition and accelerating action in this critical decade. (UNEP).\nGlobal temperature changes are typically measured against the average temperature over a historical, pre-industrial baseline of 1850\u20131900. This baseline is the earliest period for which high-quality observations of surface temperatures over the land and ocean are available. (IPCC).\nThe first months with an average temperature that was more than 1.5\u00b0C above the pre-industrial average occurred during 2015-16, driven by both human-caused climate change and a strong, naturally occurring El Ni\u00f1o. The latter part of 2023 and early 2024 also experienced monthly average global temperature anomalies above 1.5\u00b0C. (WMO)\nThe first 12-month period to exceed 1.5\u00b0C as an average was February 2023 \u2013 January 2024, boosted by El Ni\u00f1o, when the average temperature worldwide was estimated to be 1.52\u00b0C higher than 1850\u20131900, according to one scientific dataset (Copernicus Climate Change Service). The likelihood of the annual average global temperature exceeding 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels for at least one year over the coming five years has increased significantly since 2015, when it was close to zero (WMO).\nThe global average temperature for the most recent 10-year period, from 2015 to 2024, is estimated to be the warmest 10-year period on record, at around 1.24 to 1.28\u00b0C above the 1850-1900 average (EEA). The 20-year average warming for 2001\u20132020 relative to 1850\u20131900 is 0.99\u00b0C (IPCC).\nEvery fraction of a degree of warming matters. With every additional increment of global warming, changes in extremes and risks become larger. For example, every additional 0.1\u00b0C of global warming causes clearly discernible increases in the intensity and frequency of temperature and precipitation extremes, as well as agricultural and ecological droughts in some regions. (IPCC)\nLimiting global warming to below 1.5\u00b0C will significantly reduce the risks, adverse impacts, and related losses and damages from climate change. Failing to do so will lead to increasingly frequent and dangerous extreme weather events including heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, and heavy precipitation and flooding (IPCC). Extreme heat causes the greatest mortality of all extreme weather, with an estimated 489,000 heat-related deaths per year between 2000 and 2019 (WMO). Exceeding 1.5\u00b0C could also trigger multiple climate tipping points \u2014 such as breakdowns of major ocean circulation systems, abrupt thawing of boreal permafrost, and collapse of tropical coral reef systems \u2014 with abrupt, irreversible, and dangerous impacts for humanity.(Science)\nEven at current levels of global warming, we are already seeing devastating climate impacts, including intensifying extreme weather events, alarming reductions in ice sheets, sea ice, and glaciers, and several mass coral bleaching events, with widespread harms to people, economies, and nature (IPCC). In the last two decades, the 55 most climate-vulnerable economies alone have already experienced climate damages exceeding US$ 500 billion (UNEP). In 2024, disasters triggered a record 45.8 million internal displacements, of which 99.5 per cent were caused by weather-related hazards such as floods, storms, wildfires and droughts (UNDRR).\nHuman health impacts from climate change have been apparent for at least 20 years, but the climate crisis is still not treated like other global public health emergencies. Between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year from undernutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress alone. The cumulative death toll will likely be much higher, as climate change acts as a threat multiplier of many other extreme weather events and public health risks. (WHO)\nMany climate impacts, especially sea-level rise from ice sheets, disappearance of mountain glaciers, and ocean acidification, are essentially permanent for many generations to come and will take centuries to thousands of years to restore to even today\u2019s conditions. To minimize losses and damages, it is crucial to minimize the magnitude and duration of temporarily exceeding 1.5\u00b0C by urgently and significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions and phasing out fossil fuels. (New insights; IPCC)\nUnder global modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C with no or limited temporary overshoot, global greenhouse gas emissions peak by 2025, and are reduced by 43% by 2030 relative to 2019. carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reach net zero by 2050.

How do we know when we\u2019ve passed 1.5\u00b0C? And what happens if we do?\nThe Industrial Revolution transformed the textile industry in England. This engraving by Edward Goodall (1795-1870), originally titled \"Manchester, from Kersal Moor,\" after a painting of W. Wylde, shows numerous industrial chimneys in the town of Manchester, England, which earned the nickname \"Cottonopolis,\" following its transformation. Image in the public domain, from Wikimedia.\nWhen you read or hear climate numbers, they are often being compared to average. The September 2023 NOAA global surface temperatures, for instance, were 1.44 degrees Celsius above average. That average represents a defined period of time. In this case, September was 1.44\u00b0C warmer than the average September of the twentieth century.\nFor the 1.5\u00b0C climate threshold, the \u201caverage\u201d time range is defined as the \u201cpre-industrial period\u201d, or the period of time before the increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases due to human-emissions began to significantly influence global temperatures. Sounds a bit vague, right? What years make up this \u201cpre-industrial period?\u201d It depends.\nMost history books define the dates of the Industrial Revolution as between the mid-1700s and mid-1800s, but scientific definitions of pre-industrial typically cover some range of decades between 1850 and 1900. Why? Because that\u2019s the earliest time period with widespread, consistent surface temperature records. Different research groups use different parts of the broader time range. For NOAA data, we currently define pre-industrial as 1850-1900. (Footnote 1)\nWhile there can be differences in what counts as \u201cpre-industrial\u201d, it's important to remember that industrial versus pre-industrial is really about the human signature on our climate and how scientists can distinguish that from natural variability going back thousands of years. (Footnote 2)\nHow far the global temperature is above average depends on how you define average. For NOAA's global temperature dataset, \"pre-industrial\" is defined as the period from 1850-1900. For routine monthly reports, NOAA compares monthly temperatures to the 20th-century average. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from NCEI.\nAdding to the nuance, global surface temperature itself can potentially refer to different temperature variables measured in different ways. On land, thermometer-measured temperature variables can include readings at both at the literal ground surface and at two meters above. Over water, ships and buoys can measure the surface ocean temperature directly as well as the air temperature two meters above the water. From high above, satellites don\u2019t directly measure temperatures, but scientists derive land surface and atmospheric temperatures based on the amount of thermal and microwave energy satellites receive.\nSuffice to say, there are a lot of ways of measuring temperatures. And THEN there are different ways of combining those observations into a global dataset. (Despite these differences, all major temperature records show a similar long-term warming trend.) When NOAA releases the latest monthly climate statistics, it uses the NOAA Global Surface Temperature (NOAAGlobalTemp) dataset which blends in-ocean sea surface temperatures and 2-meter air temperatures.\nSo, when you come across stories about the 1.5\u00b0C threshold\u2014especially if you think you\u2019re seeing contradictory stories about whether we have or haven\u2019t reached 1.5\u00b0C\u2014 you should ask yourself three questions. 1) What is the dataset? 2) What is the \u201cpre-industrial\u201d time period? 3) What kind of temperature is being used? Those are the details you need to be able to put that story into context and compare it to other sources of information.\nLet\u2019s go back in time before large international climate conferences like COP28 existed. In the 1970s and 1980s, as climate science was evolving and our understanding of the impacts that human activities were having on greenhouse gas emissions, scientists were using different temperature thresholds to understand the potential impacts of these emissions (Nordhaus 1975). These thresholds usually ranged from 1-2\u00b0C.\nAs the international community has come together to address climate change, it became important to have an agreed upon temperature target as a catalyst for climate action When the first international climate treaty was negotiated in 1992, Parties agreed to stabilize \u201cgreenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.\u201d In 2010, the Cancun Agreement further recognized the need \u201cto hold the increase in global average temperature below 2\u00b0C above preindustrial levels\u201d.\nHowever, research continued to show that for some countries and vulnerable ecosystems, the risk of grave damage rapidly increases at less than 2\u00b0C of warming. So in 2015, nearly the entire world (195 nations) came together at the United Nations-held international climate meeting COP21 to sign the Paris Agreement. This landmark treaty explicitly states that the world\u2019s nations pledged to \u201chold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industr\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

(IPCC)\nUnder the Paris Agreement, countries agreed to substantially reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to enable the long-term global average surface temperature increase to be kept well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5\u00b0C.(Paris Agreement)\nCountries have emphasized that the impacts of climate change would be much lower at a temperature increase of 1.5\u00b0C, compared with 2\u00b0C, and expressed their firm resolve to pursue efforts to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C.(COP outcomes; IPCC)\nMonthly and annual breaches of 1.5\u00b0C do not mean that the world has failed to achieve the Paris Agreement\u2019s temperature goal, which refers to a long-term temperature increase over decades, not individual months or years. Temperatures for any single month or year fluctuate due to natural variability, including El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a and volcanic eruptions. Consequently, long-term temperature changes are typically considered on decadal timescales. (WMO)\nThe year 2024 was the warmest year in the 175-year observational record, with a global mean near-surface temperature 1.55\u00b0C above the 1850\u20131900 average.\nNevertheless, breaches of 1.5\u00b0C for a month or a year are early signs of getting perilously close to exceeding the long-term limit, and serve as clarion calls for increasing ambition and accelerating action in this critical decade. (UNEP).\nGlobal temperature changes are typically measured against the average temperature over a historical, pre-industrial baseline of 1850\u20131900. This baseline is the earliest period for which high-quality observations of surface temperatures over the land and ocean are available. (IPCC).\nThe first months with an average temperature that was more than 1.5\u00b0C above the pre-industrial average occurred during 2015-16, driven by both human-caused climate change and a strong, naturally occurring El Ni\u00f1o. The latter part of 2023 and early 2024 also experienced monthly average global temperature anomalies above 1.5\u00b0C. (WMO)\nThe first 12-month period to exceed 1.5\u00b0C as an average was February 2023 \u2013 January 2024, boosted by El Ni\u00f1o, when the average temperature worldwide was estimated to be 1.52\u00b0C higher than 1850\u20131900, according to one scientific dataset (Copernicus Climate Change Service). The likelihood of the annual average global temperature exceeding 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels for at least one year over the coming five years has increased significantly since 2015, when it was close to zero (WMO).\nThe global average temperature for the most recent 10-year period, from 2015 to 2024, is estimated to be the warmest 10-year period on record, at around 1.24 to 1.28\u00b0C above the 1850-1900 average (EEA). The 20-year average warming for 2001\u20132020 relative to 1850\u20131900 is 0.99\u00b0C (IPCC).\nEvery fraction of a degree of warming matters. With every additional increment of global warming, changes in extremes and risks become larger. For example, every additional 0.1\u00b0C of global warming causes clearly discernible increases in the intensity and frequency of temperature and precipitation extremes, as well as agricultural and ecological droughts in some regions. (IPCC)\nLimiting global warming to below 1.5\u00b0C will significantly reduce the risks, adverse impacts, and related losses and damages from climate change. Failing to do so will lead to increasingly frequent and dangerous extreme weather events including heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, and heavy precipitation and flooding (IPCC). Extreme heat causes the greatest mortality of all extreme weather, with an estimated 489,000 heat-related deaths per year between 2000 and 2019 (WMO). Exceeding 1.5\u00b0C could also trigger multiple climate tipping points \u2014 such as breakdowns of major ocean circulation systems, abrupt thawing of boreal permafrost, and collapse of tropical coral reef systems \u2014 with abrupt, irreversible, and dangerous impacts for humanity.(Science)\nEven at current levels of global warming, we are already seeing devastating climate impacts, including intensifying extreme weather events, alarming reductions in ice sheets, sea ice, and glaciers, and several mass coral bleaching events, with widespread harms to people, economies, and nature (IPCC). In the last two decades, the 55 most climate-vulnerable economies alone have already experienced climate damages exceeding US$ 500 billion (UNEP). In 2024, disasters triggered a record 45.8 million internal displacements, of which 99.5 per cent were caused by weather-related hazards such as floods, storms, wildfires and droughts (UNDRR).\nHuman health impacts from climate change have been apparent for at least 20 years, but the climate crisis is still not treated like other global public health emergencies. Between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year from undernutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress alone. The cumulative death toll will likely be much higher, as climate change acts as a threat multiplier of many other extreme weather events and public health risks. (WHO)\nMany climate impacts, especially sea-level rise from ice sheets, disappearance of mountain glaciers, and ocean acidification, are essentially permanent for many generations to come and will take centuries to thousands of years to restore to even today\u2019s conditions. To minimize losses and damages, it is crucial to minimize the magnitude and duration of temporarily exceeding 1.5\u00b0C by urgently and significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions and phasing out fossil fuels. (New insights; IPCC)\nUnder global modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C with no or limited temporary overshoot, global greenhouse gas emissions peak by 2025, and are reduced by 43% by 2030 relative to 2019. carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reach net zero by 2050.

Now ...\n\nGoogle Search Snippet:\nIn 2024, the Earth's average temperature was reportedly 1.5\u00b0C warmer than in pre-industrial times. So, what's new about the Emissions Gap ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nThe science is clear: to avert the worst impacts of climate change and preserve a liveable planet, global warming needs to be limited as much as possible and as a matter of urgency. (IPCC)\nUnder the Paris Agreement, countries agreed to substantially reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to enable the long-term global average surface temperature increase to be kept well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5\u00b0C.(Paris Agreement)\nCountries have emphasized that the impacts of climate change would be much lower at a temperature increase of 1.5\u00b0C, compared with 2\u00b0C, and expressed their firm resolve to pursue efforts to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C.(COP outcomes; IPCC)\nMonthly and annual breaches of 1.5\u00b0C do not mean that the world has failed to achieve the Paris Agreement\u2019s temperature goal, which refers to a long-term temperature increase over decades, not individual months or years. Temperatures for any single month or year fluctuate due to natural variability, including El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a and volcanic eruptions. Consequently, long-term temperature changes are typically considered on decadal timescales. (WMO)\nThe year 2024 was the warmest year in the 175-year observational record, with a global mean near-surface temperature 1.55\u00b0C above the 1850\u20131900 average.\nNevertheless, breaches of 1.5\u00b0C for a month or a year are early signs of getting perilously close to exceeding the long-term limit, and serve as clarion calls for increasing ambition and accelerating action in this critical decade. (UNEP).\nGlobal temperature changes are typically measured against the average temperature over a historical, pre-industrial baseline of 1850\u20131900. This baseline is the earliest period for which high-quality observations of surface temperatures over the land and ocean are available. (IPCC).\nThe first months with an average temperature that was more than 1.5\u00b0C above the pre-industrial average occurred during 2015-16, driven by both human-caused climate change and a strong, naturally occurring El Ni\u00f1o. The latter part of 2023 and early 2024 also experienced monthly average global temperature anomalies above 1.5\u00b0C. (WMO)\nThe first 12-month period to exceed 1.5\u00b0C as an average was February 2023 \u2013 January 2024, boosted by El Ni\u00f1o, when the average temperature worldwide was estimated to be 1.52\u00b0C higher than 1850\u20131900, according to one scientific dataset (Copernicus Climate Change Service). The likelihood of the annual average global temperature exceeding 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels for at least one year over the coming five years has increased significantly since 2015, when it was close to zero (WMO).\nThe global average temperature for the most recent 10-year period, from 2015 to 2024, is estimated to be the warmest 10-year period on record, at around 1.24 to 1.28\u00b0C above the 1850-1900 average (EEA). The 20-year average warming for 2001\u20132020 relative to 1850\u20131900 is 0.99\u00b0C (IPCC).\nEvery fraction of a degree of warming matters. With every additional increment of global warming, changes in extremes and risks become larger. For example, every additional 0.1\u00b0C of global warming causes clearly discernible increases in the intensity and frequency of temperature and precipitation extremes, as well as agricultural and ecological droughts in some regions. (IPCC)\nLimiting global warming to below 1.5\u00b0C will significantly reduce the risks, adverse impacts, and related losses and damages from climate change. Failing to do so will lead to increasingly frequent and dangerous extreme weather events including heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, and heavy precipitation and flooding (IPCC). Extreme heat causes the greatest mortality of all extreme weather, with an estimated 489,000 heat-related deaths per year between 2000 and 2019 (WMO). Exceeding 1.5\u00b0C could also trigger multiple climate tipping points \u2014 such as breakdowns of major ocean circulation systems, abrupt thawing of boreal permafrost, and collapse of tropical coral reef systems \u2014 with abrupt, irreversible, and dangerous impacts for humanity.(Science)\nEven at current levels of global warming, we are already seeing devastating climate impacts, including intensifying extreme weather events, alarming reductions in ice sheets, sea ice, and glaciers, and several mass coral bleaching events, with widespread harms to people, economies, and nature (IPCC). In the last two decades, the 55 most climate-vulnerable economies alone have already experienced climate damages exceeding US$ 500 billion (UNEP). In 2024, disasters triggered a record 45.8 million internal displacements, of which 99.5 per cent were caused by weather-related hazards such as floods, storms, wildfires and droughts (UNDRR).\nHuman health impacts from climate change have been apparent for at least 20 years, but the climate crisis is still not treated like other global public health emergencies. Between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year from undernutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress alone. The cumulative death toll will likely be much higher, as climate change acts as a threat multiplier of many other extreme weather events and public health risks. (WHO)\nMany climate impacts, especially sea-level rise from ice sheets, disappearance of mountain glaciers, and ocean acidification, are essentially permanent for many generations to come and will take centuries to thousands of years to restore to even today\u2019s conditions. To minimize losses and damages, it is crucial to minimize the magnitude and duration of temporarily exceeding 1.5\u00b0C by urgently and significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions and phasing out fossil fuels. (New insights; IPCC)\nUnder global modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C with no or limited temporary overshoot, global greenhouse gas emissions peak by 2025, and are reduced by 43% by 2030 relative to 2019. carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reach net zero by 2050.
