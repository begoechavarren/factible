    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nWhat if I told you that someone had developed an energy source that could help us solve our biggest environmental challenges, purify our water and air, make our cities and homes more sanitary, and keep us safe from potential catastrophic climate change? What if I also told you that this energy source was cheap, plentiful, and reliable? Well, there is such a source. You probably know it as fossil fuel. Oil. Natural gas. Coal. But wait? Don\u2019t fossil fuels pollute our environment and make our climate unlivable? That, of course, is what we\u2019re told\u2026and what our children are taught. But let\u2019s look at the data. Here\u2019s a graph you\u2019ve probably never seen: the correlation between use of fossil fuels and access to clean water. More fossil fuel. More clean water. Am I saying the more we that we have used fossil fuel, the cleaner our water has become? Yes, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying. In the developed world, we take clean water for granted. We turn on a tap and it\u2019s there. But getting it there takes a massive amount of energy. Think of the man-made reservoirs, the purification plants, the network of pipes. In the undeveloped world, it\u2019s a much different story. They lack the energy, so they lack clean water. More fossil fuel. More clean water. The same is true of sanitation. By the use of cheap, plentiful, and reliable energy from fossil fuels, we have made our environment cleaner. Take a look at this graph. More fossil fuel. Better sanitation. Okay, what about air quality? Here\u2019s a graph of the air pollution trends in the United States over the last half century based on data from the Environmental Protection Agency. Note the dramatic downward trend in emissions, even though we use more fossil fuel than ever. How was this achieved? Above all, by using anti-pollution technology powered by\u2026 fossil fuel: oil, natural gas and coal. But even without modern pollution control technology, fossil fuel makes our air cleaner. Indoor pollution\u2014caused by burning a fire inside your house, cabin, hut or tent to cook and keep warm\u2014was a deadly global problem until the late 19th century when cheap kerosene, a fossil fuel byproduct, became available in America and Europe. Indoor pollution is still a major issue in the developing world today. The best solution? Fossil fuel. And now we come to the biggest fossil fuel concern of all\u2014global warming. On this very sensitive topic we need to get our terms straight: There is a big difference between mild global warming and catastrophic global warming. We can all agree on that, right? The issue isn\u2019t: does burning fossil fuel have some warming impact? It does. The issue is: is the climate warming dangerously fast? In 1986 NASA climate scientist James Hansen\u2014one of the world\u2019s most prominent critics of the use of fossil fuels\u2014predicted that \u201cif current trends are unchanged,\u201d temperatures would rise 2 to 4 degrees in the first decade of the 2000s. But as you can see from this graph, since 2000 the trend line is essentially flat\u2014little or no warming in the last 15 years. That\u2019s probably why we hear much less talk about \u201cglobal warming\u201d and much more talk about \u201cclimate change.\u201d Has this \u201cclimate change\u201d made our world more dangerous? The key statistic here, one that is, unfortunately, almost never mentioned, is \u201cclimate-related deaths,\u201d that is, how many people die each year from a climate-related cause, including droughts, floods, storms, and extreme temperatures. In the last eighty years, as CO2 emissions have rapidly escalated, the annual rate of climate-related deaths worldwide has rapidly declined -- by 98%. The reason is that the energy from fossil fuel has allowed the developed world to build a durable civilization, one highly resilient to extreme heat, extreme cold, floods, storms, and so on. The developing world\u2014where natural disasters can still wreak terrible havoc\u2014 would like the chance to do the same. But to do that they will need a lot more energy. The cheapest, fastest and easiest way to get that energy is from fossil fuels. In sum, fossil fuels don\u2019t take a naturally safe environment and make it dangerous; they empower us to take a naturally dangerous environment and make it cleaner and safer.

The negative impacts that non-renewable energy sources like fossil fuels have on air quality, climate change, and environmental health have become increasingly clear. By increasingly relying on renewable energy sources like wind and solar power, we can reap a wide variety of benefits including reduced air pollution, lower greenhouse gas emission levels, decreased healthcare costs, a more resilient electrical grid, and job generation.\nThe UN says that with technology available today, cheap electricity from renewable sources could provide 65 percent of the world\u2019s total electricity supply by 2030 and decarbonize 90 percent of the power sector by 2050, massively cutting carbon emissions and improving air quality. But what exactly is the relationship between energy production and air pollution? We\u2019ll take a deep dive into this topic and see that the benefits of investing in clean energy sources become even more compelling when both air quality and climate benefits are considered.\nNon-renewable energy comes from sources that cannot be replenished in our lifetime. The most common sources of non-renewable energy are carbon-containing fossil fuels, including coal, petroleum, and natural gas. According to data from the Central Intelligence Agency, more than 66% of world electric generation comes from fossil fuels today.\nIn contrast, renewable energy comes from sources that can be replenished faster than they are consumed.\nRenewable energy sources produce little to no greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change, even when considering their life cycle emissions that occur through each stage of the technology\u2019s use.\nAside from relying on dwindling and expensive resources, non-renewable energy sources \u2014 specifically, fossil fuel combustion \u2014 create vast harm by releasing toxic air pollution and greenhouse gases that threaten air quality and climate health.\nEstimates from Harvard calculate that air pollution from fossil fuels may be responsible for as many as one in five deaths worldwide. Air pollution from coal-fired power plants impacts not only people in the immediate vicinity but can travel long distances depending on the prevailing wind speed and direction and put large portions of the population at risk.\nThe most common renewable energy sources include wind, solar, and geothermal with two of the safest and most common being wind and solar.\nWind energy is created using wind turbines which can be placed anywhere with high-speed winds, including hilltops to open water. Wind energy is one of the cleanest sources of energy because wind turbines do not affect air pollution emissions in any direct way and do not need water for cooling.\nSolar energy, which uses solar or photovoltaic cells to convert sunlight into electricity, is also very clean in that it doesn\u2019t produce air pollutants or contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. However, the process of manufacturing solar panels may produce some emissions.\nGeothermal energy relies on the heat produced within the Earth. Water is injected deep underground and is heated by the Earth\u2019s molten interior and returns as hot water or steam; this steam is used to power a turbine to generate electricity. Geothermal energy produces only one-sixth of the carbon dioxide of a natural gas powerplant and little to no NO2 or SO2 pollution.\nWhile biomass is sometimes listed as a source of renewable energy, the American Lung Association opposes biomass combustion as a form of energy generation because this process creates particle pollution and releases other carcinogens. However, pyrolysis \u2014 where biomass is heated in an anaerobic environment without oxygen, breaking down into oils and gases \u2014 is a potential alternative to incineration that is known to produce fewer air pollutants than burning.\nAn exciting future may exist when it comes to nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion, a process where light elements are combined to form heavier elements and release energy in the process, made recent headlines due to a scientific breakthrough where scientists demonstrated a positive energy gain in the reaction for the first time.\nHowever, we\u2019re still far from being able to use nuclear fusion as a viable energy source. Though this process can not yet be practically applied commercially, it holds the potential for a clean, safe, carbon-free, and near-limitless source of energy in the future.\nRenewable energy use is growing across the globe but unfortunately still accounts for just a portion of overall energy generation.\nGlobally, even though fossil fuels still account for the majority of energy production, renewable energy sources now make up 29% of current electricity production.\nIn the United States, 29% of greenhouse gas emissions come from electricity production, particularly from fossil fuel combustion. However, the U.S. is increasing its use of nonfossil fuel sources of energy, with 21% of the country\u2019s energy consumption coming from renewable sources in 2020 \u2014 the highest share since the early 1900s.\nBy increasing the supply and use of renewable energy like wind and solar, we can replace carbon-intensive sources like fossil fuels and lower the amount of greenhouse gas emissions released.\nAir pollution is a severe global crisis, with the World Health Organi\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Nuclear fusion, a process where light elements are combined to form heavier elements and release energy in the process, made recent headlines due to a scientific breakthrough where scientists demonstrated a positive energy gain in the reaction for the first time.\nHowever, we\u2019re still far from being able to use nuclear fusion as a viable energy source. Though this process can not yet be practically applied commercially, it holds the potential for a clean, safe, carbon-free, and near-limitless source of energy in the future.\nRenewable energy use is growing across the globe but unfortunately still accounts for just a portion of overall energy generation.\nGlobally, even though fossil fuels still account for the majority of energy production, renewable energy sources now make up 29% of current electricity production.\nIn the United States, 29% of greenhouse gas emissions come from electricity production, particularly from fossil fuel combustion. However, the U.S. is increasing its use of nonfossil fuel sources of energy, with 21% of the country\u2019s energy consumption coming from renewable sources in 2020 \u2014 the highest share since the early 1900s.\nBy increasing the supply and use of renewable energy like wind and solar, we can replace carbon-intensive sources like fossil fuels and lower the amount of greenhouse gas emissions released.\nAir pollution is a severe global crisis, with the World Health Organi\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",
