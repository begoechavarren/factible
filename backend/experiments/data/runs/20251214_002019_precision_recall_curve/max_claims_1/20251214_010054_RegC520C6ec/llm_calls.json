occurring every day around the planet are blamed on mother nature but nothing could be further from the [Music] truth all that is required to understand explain and demonstrate how Decades of global geoengineering development is directly and deliberately responsible for all of the Super Storms hurricanes tornadoes and floods is the understanding of a few simple [Music] Concepts however to find un altered explanations of these Concepts we must first travel back 60 years [Music] rain rain go away come again some other day two young fellas want to play one is Fred he lives in this Farm the other is Pete he lives in the city he's visiting [Music] friend boy where does all this rain come from from the sky everybody knows that [Music] but what Pete really wants to know is how does the water get into the sky well let's see Fred sees one way as the water dries off the horses it goes into the air but there are lots of other ways when the sun comes out strongly after a shower we can almost see the water disappearing into the air [Music] here heat from the Sun is drying the roof water at the top edge of the puddle slowly disappears into the air right before our eyes billions of gallons of water go into the air every hour from the ponds lakes rivers and oceans all over the world in fact everything that dries as giving water to the air even wet Fields do [Music] this and wet clothes on a line slowly lose water to the air and become [Music] dry whether you can see it or whether you can't water is always going into the air from many things even dogs give water to the air as they pant [Music] people as well as animals have to replace the water their bodies give off to the [Music] air yep there's another way water can get into the air the water on the doghouse roof dried pretty fast in the warm sun this this water disappears faster because the stove is hotter this change from water we can see to water vapor we can't see is called [Music] evaporation no that's not evaporation that water isn't changing to water vapor it's just sinking into the soil evaporation comes later the leaves give off water to the air water taken up of the plant's Roots it's hard to believe so let's find out if it's true first a cardboard disc to cover the wet soil then a jar to keep any water vapor from the leaves from being lost to the air and the jar without a [Music] plan and last time until tomorrow [Music] morning during the night the plant gave off water because the jar without the plant is dry inside the jar are droplets just like the droplets that form in the moisture from Fred's warm breath hits the window glass the water vapor changes into very small drops of water because the window is cold in the same way the water vapor from the plant changed to water when it touched the cooler surface of the jar but what happens if the glass is warm the best way to answer such a question is to try [Music] it first a glass is [Music] warm then another glass is chilled [Music] what happens with the warm glass nothing but soon on the cold glass glass water collects water from the air when this happens it's called condensation condensation causes dew on the grass during the night when the earth and grass is cooler than the air condensation takes place and the water vapor forms little drops of water the cloud from the spot of the teac kettle is condensation of the water vapor from the teac kettle hitting the colder air the water vapor in the warm air of the room forms a cloud as it hits the very cold air from the refrigerator [Music] uh-oh now what's going to happen [Music] condensation rain [Music] the hot water in the kettle gives off water vapor to the air by rapid evaporation just as rivers lakes and ponds give off water vapor to the air by slow evaporation as the hot water-filled air hits the colder air near the ice tray the water vapor turns into clouds of tiny water droplets floating in the air condensation when the air is quite cold and cannot hold any more water droplets they collect together to form larger drops as on the ice tray and being too heavy to float in the air they fall back to the Earth as [Music] rain without water in the air we couldn't live our Fields would be dry and nothing would grow because water evaporates in the air and returns again as rain we have water running through the valleys in our Brooks and streams filling reservoirs with water to drink turning our water wheels and turning the turbines and the powerhouses to give us electricity all from water in the air the fundamentals of global geoengineering are no different than this child's experiment water vapor is artificially introduced into the air in place of the natural evaporation stage and is artificially cooled and condensed to produce [Music] rain you need a great many tea kettal to produce the massive amounts of water vapor required to fuel these Global storm systems and this planet is deliberately covered with them [Music] [Music] this artificial precipitation generation is easy to see on infrared satellite and is identified by sudden coordinated bursts of superheated water vapor from no natural source [Music] [Music] ironically the same primary source of CO2 Emissions on this planet is the same source of artificial [Music] precipitation this Nationwide artificial precipitation generation site clickers like clockwork every single day [Music] hexagonal Center of Vortex with flat size proves geoengineering manufacturer nightly Nationwide coordinated artificial precipitation generation Noti is the total absence of natural

Depending on the approach ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nGeoengineering methods are intended to reduce climate change, which is already having demonstrable effects on ecosystem structure and functioning in some regions. Two types of geoengineering activities that have been proposed are: carbon dioxide (CO2) removal (CDR), which removes CO2 from the atmosphere, and solar radiation management (SRM, or sunlight reflection methods), which reflects a small percentage of sunlight back into space to offset warming from greenhouse gases (GHGs). Current research suggests that SRM or CDR might diminish the impacts of climate change on ecosystems by reducing changes in temperature and precipitation. However, sudden cessation of SRM would exacerbate the climate effects on ecosystems, and some CDR might interfere with oceanic and terrestrial ecosystem processes. The many risks and uncertainties associated with these new kinds of purposeful perturbations to the Earth system are not well understood and require cautious and comprehensive research.\nKeywords: Geoengineering, Ecosystems, Climate change, Carbon dioxide removal, Solar radiation management\nAs anthropogenic emissions of GHG rise and their concentrations in the atmosphere continue to increase, there is growing discussion about the need to evaluate \u201cgeoengineering\u201d methods to reduce the greenhouse effects on the climate and environment (Shepherd et al. 2009). Geoengineering can be defined as the deliberate manipulation of features of the Earth system to reduce the magnitude and rate of changes in the physical climate system that are attributed to this accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs; IPCC 2007a). While there has now been much general discussion of the different means by which geoengineering may be accomplished and some speculation about the research strategies by which their effectiveness could be determined (Shepherd et al. 2009), there has been relatively little discussion of research needed to understand their potential for affecting ecosystems. Yet many geoengineering activities could significantly impact both natural and managed ecosystems and their functions. This is important because ecosystems, including those within forests, oceans, grasslands, and wetlands, provide both innate value and our life support systems, including numerous essential goods and services (MEA 2005). This study focuses on research needs related to identifying and quantifying potential ecosystem consequences of proposed geoengineering methods. Ecosystem impacts form a subset of a much broader range of pertinent social and physical science research questions, including issues of governance and ethics, all of which should be addressed before any proposed geoengineering method could be considered as a viable policy option.\nIn this report, we follow the Royal Society (Shepherd et al. 2009) in referring to two different sets of activities: carbon dioxide removal (CDR) methods, including a range of engineered and biological processes to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, and solar radiation management (SRM or sunlight reflection) methods, typically involving reflecting a small percentage of solar light and heat back into space to offset the warming due to GHGs. CDR and SRM techniques are fundamentally different in the timescales over which the interventions would operate (Lenton and Vaughan 2009; Shepherd et al. 2009). The scale-up of a CDR deployment to the point where it would have significant climate effects would be slow (likely decades for a substantial drawdown of CO2), but with long lasting effects. In contrast, SRM could provide rapid cooling (in months) but would require continual renewal. Of these two types of methods, only CDR would address the CO2 concentrations responsible for both climate change as well as other CO2-induced ecosystem effects such as ocean acidification.\nThe Earth\u2019s temperature and climate are fundamentally controlled by its energy balance, which drives and maintains the climate system. This balance consists of incoming energy from the Sun (including ultra violet, visible, and infrared) and outgoing heat (thermal infrared) radiation. These energy streams do not reach or leave Earth\u2019s surface unimpeded. On average, about one third of the incoming sunlight radiation is reflected by clouds and aerosols, ice caps, and bright surfaces. This fraction that is reflected is referred to as its \u201calbedo\u201d. Most incoming energy passes through the atmosphere to reach Earth\u2019s surface; the part not reflected by the albedo is absorbed and so warms the surface. The absorbed energy is transferred to the atmosphere by emitted surface radiation, evaporative cooling, and direct thermal motion. Some outgoing thermal energy then emitted by Earth\u2019s surface is absorbed by GHGs in the atmosphere (mainly by water vapor and CO2) and also by clouds, thus reducing the amount of heat radiation escaping to space and warming the atmosphere and Earth\u2019s surface. This is known as the greenhouse effect. On average, only about 60% of the radiation emitted at the surface leaves the atmosphere, after absorption and emission within the atmosphere. Increased atmospheric CO2 is not only responsible for temperature changes, but for other consequences to the Earth system. In addition, increased CO2 absorbed by the ocean has a measurable effect on ocean acidity, with consequent impacts on ocean biogeochemistry and biodiversity.\nCDR methods are designed to remove CO2 from the atmosphere and transfer it to long-lived carbon reservoirs. They include:\nLand use management to protect or enhance terrestrial carbon sinks;\nUsing biomass for carbon sequestration as well as (or instead of) a carbon neutral energy source;\nAccelerating natural geological processes that remove CO2 from the atmosphere (e.g., \u201cenhanced weathering\u201d);\nDirect engineered capture of CO2 from ambient air (i.e., collection and removal of CO2 from the atmosphere to storage reservoirs that are isolated from the atm\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Despite being at odds with international law and subject to a de facto global moratorium, an alarming number of geoengineering field experiments are planned or underway, many driven by voluntary carbon markets.\nBehind the shiny facade of these highly speculative \u201ctechno-fixes,\u201d geoengineering is fraught with risks, uncertainties, and dangers that threaten to delay real climate action and cause more harm than good.\nGeoengineering refers to large or planetary-scale interventions in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, oceans, and land to counteract some of the effects of climate change. These methods range from reflecting sunlight to removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\nCrucially, none tackle the root causes of the climate crisis, the primary driver of which is the production and burning of fossil fuels.\nSRM techniques attempt to reflect sunlight back into space to cool Earth. Methods include releasing large amounts of tiny reflective particles (e.g., sulfur dioxide) into the stratosphere, deploying mirrors in space, or modifying clouds, ice, and plants to make them more reflective.\nCDR techniques theorize removing carbon from the atmosphere on a massive scale. Methods range from sucking carbon straight out of the air to the large-scale burning of trees for energy, capturing and storing the emissions, and even dumping minerals in the ocean or developing monoculture seaweed mega-farms to increase carbon uptake.\nOther theories include slowing ice melt by pumping seawater onto polar and glacial ice to thicken it, spreading billions of tiny reflective beads on the surface of the Arctic or glacial ice to increase its reflectivity, and building a giant curtain in the ocean to block warmer waters.\nGeoengineering technologies do nothing to address the drivers of the climate crisis, and all come with major risks and unknowns. For example, solar geoengineering is inherently unpredictable and risks further destabilizing an already destabilized climate system. Models show that it would have an uneven effect regionally and could exacerbate climate change in countries on the front line of the crisis. What\u2019s more, it carries the risk of \u2018termination shock\u2019 where temperatures suddenly spiral if, for whatever reason, deployment is paused or stopped. Meanwhile, no marine carbon dioxide removal techniques have been proven effective in the long-term removal and storage of CO2, and some could undermine the ocean\u2019s ability to sequester carbon.\nThe illusion that geoengineering can help \u201cfix\u201d climate change is a dangerous distraction from the real solutions to the crisis and risks prolonging fossil fuel dependence. In fact, geoengineering technologies are inherently unpredictable and pose new, significant, unprecedented risks to the fragile ecosystems that sustain life on Earth, which are our best allies in the fight against the crisis. What\u2019s more, relying on the promise of future speculative technologies instead of implementing real solutions today will lead to an overshoot of the critical climate threshold of 1.5\u00baC and lock in catastrophic climate change. By undermining transformative, justice-centered solutions to the climate crisis, geoengineering approaches also risk entrenching inequitable political and social power and perpetuating neocolonialism.\nBy their very nature, it\u2019s impossible to test geoengineering technologies for their intended impact on the climate without large-scale outdoor deployment, by which time any harmful and potentially irreversible impacts would be locked in. Research showing theoretical benefits tends to use highly idealized models underplaying harmful impacts and the likelihood that deployment would not go as planned in the real world.

Disrupting it could have intense and far-reaching ramifications ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nGeoengineering methods are intended to reduce climate change, which is already having demonstrable effects on ecosystem structure and functioning in some regions. Two types of geoengineering activities that have been proposed are: carbon dioxide (CO2) removal (CDR), which removes CO2 from the atmosphere, and solar radiation management (SRM, or sunlight reflection methods), which reflects a small percentage of sunlight back into space to offset warming from greenhouse gases (GHGs). Current research suggests that SRM or CDR might diminish the impacts of climate change on ecosystems by reducing changes in temperature and precipitation. However, sudden cessation of SRM would exacerbate the climate effects on ecosystems, and some CDR might interfere with oceanic and terrestrial ecosystem processes. The many risks and uncertainties associated with these new kinds of purposeful perturbations to the Earth system are not well understood and require cautious and comprehensive research.\nKeywords: Geoengineering, Ecosystems, Climate change, Carbon dioxide removal, Solar radiation management\nAs anthropogenic emissions of GHG rise and their concentrations in the atmosphere continue to increase, there is growing discussion about the need to evaluate \u201cgeoengineering\u201d methods to reduce the greenhouse effects on the climate and environment (Shepherd et al. 2009). Geoengineering can be defined as the deliberate manipulation of features of the Earth system to reduce the magnitude and rate of changes in the physical climate system that are attributed to this accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs; IPCC 2007a). While there has now been much general discussion of the different means by which geoengineering may be accomplished and some speculation about the research strategies by which their effectiveness could be determined (Shepherd et al. 2009), there has been relatively little discussion of research needed to understand their potential for affecting ecosystems. Yet many geoengineering activities could significantly impact both natural and managed ecosystems and their functions. This is important because ecosystems, including those within forests, oceans, grasslands, and wetlands, provide both innate value and our life support systems, including numerous essential goods and services (MEA 2005). This study focuses on research needs related to identifying and quantifying potential ecosystem consequences of proposed geoengineering methods. Ecosystem impacts form a subset of a much broader range of pertinent social and physical science research questions, including issues of governance and ethics, all of which should be addressed before any proposed geoengineering method could be considered as a viable policy option.\nIn this report, we follow the Royal Society (Shepherd et al. 2009) in referring to two different sets of activities: carbon dioxide removal (CDR) methods, including a range of engineered and biological processes to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, and solar radiation management (SRM or sunlight reflection) methods, typically involving reflecting a small percentage of solar light and heat back into space to offset the warming due to GHGs. CDR and SRM techniques are fundamentally different in the timescales over which the interventions would operate (Lenton and Vaughan 2009; Shepherd et al. 2009). The scale-up of a CDR deployment to the point where it would have significant climate effects would be slow (likely decades for a substantial drawdown of CO2), but with long lasting effects. In contrast, SRM could provide rapid cooling (in months) but would require continual renewal. Of these two types of methods, only CDR would address the CO2 concentrations responsible for both climate change as well as other CO2-induced ecosystem effects such as ocean acidification.\nThe Earth\u2019s temperature and climate are fundamentally controlled by its energy balance, which drives and maintains the climate system. This balance consists of incoming energy from the Sun (including ultra violet, visible, and infrared) and outgoing heat (thermal infrared) radiation. These energy streams do not reach or leave Earth\u2019s surface unimpeded. On average, about one third of the incoming sunlight radiation is reflected by clouds and aerosols, ice caps, and bright surfaces. This fraction that is reflected is referred to as its \u201calbedo\u201d. Most incoming energy passes through the atmosphere to reach Earth\u2019s surface; the part not reflected by the albedo is absorbed and so warms the surface. The absorbed energy is transferred to the atmosphere by emitted surface radiation, evaporative cooling, and direct thermal motion. Some outgoing thermal energy then emitted by Earth\u2019s surface is absorbed by GHGs in the atmosphere (mainly by water vapor and CO2) and also by clouds, thus reducing the amount of heat radiation escaping to space and warming the atmosphere and Earth\u2019s surface. This is known as the greenhouse effect. On average, only about 60% of the radiation emitted at the surface leaves the atmosphere, after absorption and emission within the atmosphere. Increased atmospheric CO2 is not only responsible for temperature changes, but for other consequences to the Earth system. In addition, increased CO2 absorbed by the ocean has a measurable effect on ocean acidity, with consequent impacts on ocean biogeochemistry and biodiversity.\nCDR methods are designed to remove CO2 from the atmosphere and transfer it to long-lived carbon reservoirs. They include:\nLand use management to protect or enhance terrestrial carbon sinks;\nUsing biomass for carbon sequestration as well as (or instead of) a carbon neutral energy source;\nAccelerating natural geological processes that remove CO2 from the atmosphere (e.g., \u201cenhanced weathering\u201d);\nDirect engineered capture of CO2 from ambient air (i.e., collection and removal of CO2 from the atmosphere to storage reservoirs that are isolated from the atm\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Geoengineering can be defined as the deliberate manipulation of features of the Earth system to reduce the magnitude and rate of changes in the physical climate system that are attributed to this accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs; IPCC 2007a). While there has now been much general discussion of the different means by which geoengineering may be accomplished and some speculation about the research strategies by which their effectiveness could be determined (Shepherd et al. 2009), there has been relatively little discussion of research needed to understand their potential for affecting ecosystems. Yet many geoengineering activities could significantly impact both natural and managed ecosystems and their functions. This is important because ecosystems, including those within forests, oceans, grasslands, and wetlands, provide both innate value and our life support systems, including numerous essential goods and services (MEA 2005). This study focuses on research needs related to identifying and quantifying potential ecosystem consequences of proposed geoengineering methods. Ecosystem impacts form a subset of a much broader range of pertinent social and physical science research questions, including issues of governance and ethics, all of which should be addressed before any proposed geoengineering method could be considered as a viable policy option.\nIn this report, we follow the Royal Society (Shepherd et al. 2009) in referring to two different sets of activities: carbon dioxide removal (CDR) methods, including a range of engineered and biological processes to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, and solar radiation management (SRM or sunlight reflection) methods, typically involving reflecting a small percentage of solar light and heat back into space to offset the warming due to GHGs. CDR and SRM techniques are fundamentally different in the timescales over which the interventions would operate (Lenton and Vaughan 2009; Shepherd et al. 2009). The scale-up of a CDR deployment to the point where it would have significant climate effects would be slow (likely decades for a substantial drawdown of CO2), but with long lasting effects. In contrast, SRM could provide rapid cooling (in months) but would require continual renewal. Of these two types of methods, only CDR would address the CO2 concentrations responsible for both climate change as well as other CO2-induced ecosystem effects such as ocean acidification.\nThe Earth\u2019s temperature and climate are fundamentally controlled by its energy balance, which drives and maintains the climate system. This balance consists of incoming energy from the Sun (including ultra violet, visible, and infrared) and outgoing heat (thermal infrared) radiation. These energy streams do not reach or leave Earth\u2019s surface unimpeded. On average, about one third of the incoming sunlight radiation is reflected by clouds and aerosols, ice caps, and bright surfaces. This fraction that is reflected is referred to as its \u201calbedo\u201d. Most incoming energy passes through the atmosphere to reach Earth\u2019s surface; the part not reflected by the albedo is absorbed and so warms the surface. The absorbed energy is transferred to the atmosphere by emitted surface radiation, evaporative cooling, and direct thermal motion. Some outgoing thermal energy then emitted by Earth\u2019s surface is absorbed by GHGs in the atmosphere (mainly by water vapor and CO2) and also by clouds, thus reducing the amount of heat radiation escaping to space and warming the atmosphere and Earth\u2019s surface. This is known as the greenhouse effect. On average, only about 60% of the radiation emitted at the surface leaves the atmosphere, after absorption and emission within the atmosphere. Increased atmospheric CO2 is not only responsible for temperature changes, but for other consequences to the Earth system. In addition, increased CO2 absorbed by the ocean has a measurable effect on ocean acidity, with consequent impacts on ocean biogeochemistry and biodiversity.\nCDR methods are designed to remove CO2 from the atmosphere and transfer it to long-lived carbon reservoirs. They include:\nLand use management to protect or enhance terrestrial carbon sinks;\nUsing biomass for carbon sequestration as well as (or instead of) a carbon neutral energy source;\nAccelerating natural geological processes that remove CO2 from the atmosphere (e.g., \u201cenhanced weathering\u201d);\nDirect engineered capture of CO2 from ambient air (i.e., collection and removal of CO2 from the atmosphere to storage reservoirs that are isolated from the atm\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

For example, ...\n\nFull Page Content:\nPublished October 15, 2024\nBy Mary Church, Geoengineering Campaign Manager at the Center for International Environmental Law, and Rossella Recupero, Communications Campaign Specialist at the Center for International Environmental Law\nThis is the first in a multi-part series exposing the threats and risks connected to geoengineering and why these technologies must not be considered effective climate action.\nAs global temperature records continue to be broken month after month and extreme weather events increase in severity as a result of climate change, governments and companies worldwide are increasingly investing in and exploring climate geoengineering as a supposed \u201csolution\u201d to global warming.\nOnce dismissed as science fiction, geoengineering has started to enter mainstream climate discourse. Despite being at odds with international law and subject to a de facto global moratorium, an alarming number of geoengineering field experiments are planned or underway, many driven by voluntary carbon markets.\nBehind the shiny facade of these highly speculative \u201ctechno-fixes,\u201d geoengineering is fraught with risks, uncertainties, and dangers that threaten to delay real climate action and cause more harm than good.\nGeoengineering refers to large or planetary-scale interventions in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, oceans, and land to counteract some of the effects of climate change. These methods range from reflecting sunlight to removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\nCrucially, none tackle the root causes of the climate crisis, the primary driver of which is the production and burning of fossil fuels.\nSRM techniques attempt to reflect sunlight back into space to cool Earth. Methods include releasing large amounts of tiny reflective particles (e.g., sulfur dioxide) into the stratosphere, deploying mirrors in space, or modifying clouds, ice, and plants to make them more reflective.\nCDR techniques theorize removing carbon from the atmosphere on a massive scale. Methods range from sucking carbon straight out of the air to the large-scale burning of trees for energy, capturing and storing the emissions, and even dumping minerals in the ocean or developing monoculture seaweed mega-farms to increase carbon uptake.\nOther theories include slowing ice melt by pumping seawater onto polar and glacial ice to thicken it, spreading billions of tiny reflective beads on the surface of the Arctic or glacial ice to increase its reflectivity, and building a giant curtain in the ocean to block warmer waters.\nGeoengineering technologies do nothing to address the drivers of the climate crisis, and all come with major risks and unknowns. For example, solar geoengineering is inherently unpredictable and risks further destabilizing an already destabilized climate system. Models show that it would have an uneven effect regionally and could exacerbate climate change in countries on the front line of the crisis. What\u2019s more, it carries the risk of \u2018termination shock\u2019 where temperatures suddenly spiral if, for whatever reason, deployment is paused or stopped. Meanwhile, no marine carbon dioxide removal techniques have been proven effective in the long-term removal and storage of CO2, and some could undermine the ocean\u2019s ability to sequester carbon.\nThe illusion that geoengineering can help \u201cfix\u201d climate change is a dangerous distraction from the real solutions to the crisis and risks prolonging fossil fuel dependence. In fact, geoengineering technologies are inherently unpredictable and pose new, significant, unprecedented risks to the fragile ecosystems that sustain life on Earth, which are our best allies in the fight against the crisis. What\u2019s more, relying on the promise of future speculative technologies instead of implementing real solutions today will lead to an overshoot of the critical climate threshold of 1.5\u00baC and lock in catastrophic climate change. By undermining transformative, justice-centered solutions to the climate crisis, geoengineering approaches also risk entrenching inequitable political and social power and perpetuating neocolonialism.\nBy their very nature, it\u2019s impossible to test geoengineering technologies for their intended impact on the climate without large-scale outdoor deployment, by which time any harmful and potentially irreversible impacts would be locked in. Research showing theoretical benefits tends to use highly idealized models underplaying harmful impacts and the likelihood that deployment would not go as planned in the real world. Small-scale outdoor experiments only serve to help develop technology and risk a slippery slope to deployment.\nTo have any chance of their intended impact on the climate geoengineering technologies would have to be deployed at a truly unprecedented scale \u2013 with enormous political, social, and environmental consequences. For example, ocean fertilization and ocean alkalinity enhancement would require approximately 10 percent of the ocean\u2019s surface for a meaningful climate impact. While for SRM to have its intended effect, the Earth would be locked into using these risky technologies for an indeterminate amount of time while emissions were reduced by highly speculative CDR approaches, with so-called \u201cpeak-shaving\u201d scenarios for stratospheric aerosol injection implying deployment of 100- 200 years.\nThe United Nations Human Rights Council\u2019s Advisory Committee has warned that geoengineering technologies \u201ccould seriously interfere with the enjoyment of human rights for millions and perhaps billions of people\u201d \u2013 because of the intended scale of deployment and the inherent risks involved. It has also drawn attention to the disproportionate impact on those who have done the least to cause the climate crisis, including communities in the global South, Indigenous Peoples, peasants, and fisherfolk.\nGeoengineering has been restricted by a de facto moratorium under the Convention on Biological Diversity since 2010.

A hard look at geoengineering reveals global risks | The Current | reliability=high (1.00)\n     URL: https://news.ucsb.edu/2025/022027/hard-look-geoengineering-reveals-global-risks\n     Summary: The article discusses the potential risks and uncertainties associated with geoengineering methods, particularly how they might impact ecosystems and climate systems. However, it does not directly link decades of geoengineering development to extreme weather events, suggesting that while geoengineering could influence climate, the specific claim about its responsibility for extreme weather is not supported.\n  2. Fact check: Debunking weather modification claims - NOAA | reliability=high (0.85)\n     URL: https://www.noaa.gov/news/fact-check-debunking-weather-modification-claims\n     Summary: The evidence indicates that while geoengineering methods are intended to mitigate climate change, they have not been shown to directly cause extreme weather events, such as hurricanes. The article emphasizes that the Earth's warming atmosphere is the primary driver of such weather phenomena, not geoengineering efforts.\nSUPPORTS (1 sources):\n  1. How extreme weather fuels interest in geoengineering | reliability=high (1.00)\n     URL: https://climate.uchicago.edu/news/how-extreme-weather-fuels-interest-in-geoengineering/\n     Summary: The article discusses the risks and uncertainties associated with geoengineering, stating that these technologies do not address the root causes of climate change and could exacerbate extreme weather events. It emphasizes that solar geoengineering is unpredictable and may destabilize the climate system, which aligns with the claim that geoengineering development is linked to extreme weather events.\nMIXED (3 sources):\n  1.

While some sources, like the NOAA fact check, refute the claim by stating that geoengineering has not been shown to directly cause extreme weather, others, such as the article from the University of Chicago, suggest that geoengineering could exacerbate extreme weather events. Additionally, several sources highlight the risks and uncertainties of geoengineering without directly linking it to extreme weather, indicating that while there are concerns, the evidence does not provide a clear consensus."
