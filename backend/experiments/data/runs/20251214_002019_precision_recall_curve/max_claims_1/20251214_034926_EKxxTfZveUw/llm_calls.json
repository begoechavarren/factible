    "input_prompt": "Extract all factual claims from this YouTube transcript:\n\nsomething happened this month that I want to make sure that people do not miss Donald Trump posted on Truth social this document it is a 32-page document containing all the latest information about what has been exposed about fraud in the 2020 election we're going to walk through this document this week on wolves and [Music] finance I need to start this video with a disclaimer YouTube policy does not allow you to say in videos that the certified results of elections were wrong so in keeping with this policy I will not be saying in this video whether Donald Trump did or did not win the 2020 election instead I'm going to be laying out all the facts and I'll let you decide for yourselves what I want you to do is watch this video all the way to the end and then leave a comment down below letting me know what you think do you think the 2020 election was stolen let me know in the comments below it's important to understand the context of President Trump's post he is currently facing a criminal Rico trial in Fulton County Georgia because he questioned the results of the 2020 election the case is based on a bizarre legal theory that Donald Trump knew that he lost the election but lied about it and committed fraud by trying to convince everyone that he actually won so the key question in the case was whether Donald Trump was lying when he claimed he won the 2020 election the district attorney bringing the case against Donald Trump is Fanny Willis it was revealed in a court filing this week that Fanny Willis has been sleeping with the special prosecutor she hired to handle the case against Trump the special prosecutor is named Nathan Wade and he has never filed a RICO case Fanny Willis has paid Nathan Wade more than $650,000 while they were sleeping together Fanny Willis has other attorneys working in her office with experience in Rico cases why in the world would she pay someone $650,000 who has no experience it turns out they would then use the money to pay for trips to places like the Caribbean this looks like obvious corruption and there is currently a motion filed to dismiss let's go back to when the case was first filed when President Trump was first arrested by Fanny Willis in August he announced that he was going to release a 100-page report containing evidence of fraud in the 2020 election that would prove the election was stolen he claimed it was a conclusive report and that all charges should be dropped against me and others now at the time he never released that report saying that his legal counsel wanted him to wait until trial I believe this new report that was just released this month is part of the president's conclusive report so what is in this new report it goes through all the swing states in the 2020 election for each state it gives a list of bullet points with evidence of fraud in the election each one of the bullet points comes with citations to sources backing up these claims this is important to understand these are not just random statements of fact the bullet points are backed up by detailed investigations which you can then read to get even more information now I'm not going to go through all the information in this report because there is a lot I'm going to review some of the more shocking highlights here is a list of all the swing states with the vote differences each of these states was called for Joe Biden some by very narrow margins Donald Trump only needed to win three of these states and he would have won the election the report argues that Donald Trump actually won all of these five states Georgia Wisconsin Pennsylvania Arizona and Michigan let's start with Georgia in my opinion this is the most obvious case of fraud it was reported that Trump lost Georgia by 11,779 votes in fton County we have video evidence of a poll worker named Ruby Freeman running the same stack of ballots through the counting machines multiple times ironically Ruby Freeman was later given the presidential citizens medal by Joe Biden for her work during the 2020 election Ruby Freeman has sued Rudy Giuliani for defamation in a Washington DC court and last month a mostly Democrat jury awarded Ruby Freeman a 100 $50 million verdict against Rudy Giuliani in the complaint Ruby Freeman explains that she did not like that Rudy Giuliani talked about the video of her and that Rudy Giuliani falsely accused her of counting the same ballots multiple times among other things she claims that since the election results were certified as correct that any statement made by Rudy Giuliani is false Rudy Giuliani was not allowed during the trial to submit one piece of evidence to the court now can someone please explain this to me how can there be a fair trial if the judge does not allow the defense to present any evidence that doesn't seem very fair to me there are some other unusual things about this case how is this case being tried in Washington DC Ruby Freeman is in Fulton County Georgia Rudy giuliani's comments were that she engaged Ed in election fraud in fton County Georgia why is this in Washington DC in the complaint Ruby Freeman explains that Rudy giuliani's comments were broadcast over the oan news channel which has an office in Washington DC Rudy Giuliani also worked in Washington DC as Donald Trump's lawyer so for that reason the case went to trial in Washington DC in front of a mostly Democrat jury Rudy Giuliani has already said that he plans to appeal the verdict it should be noted that Ruby Freeman's complaint states that this video does not show her committing illegal ballot counting but we can see with our own eyes that she counts the same stack of ballots multiple times what should we choose to believe her own statement or the video that we can see with our own eyes what do you think the problem with Ruby Freeman's statements is that the evidence provides a lot of doubt in the report from president trump it states fton county certified 59,4 in-person votes on Election Day despite the fact that only 14,522 evidence suggests the in-person vote total on Election Day was inflated by approximately 30 7,000 votes somehow a whole lot of votes came out of nowhere from people who did not exist could this have come from poll workers counting the same ballots multiple times remember that the vote difference in Georgia was only 11,779 votes and we are talking about a potential 37,000 fake ballots another issue in Georgia was the mail in ballots it's much easier to cheat with mail and ballots because anyone can drop it off in the mail you are relying on the people counting the votes like Ruby Freeman to do the honest thing and verify that the ballot is accurate before they count it well it turns out that in Georgia likely 67,2 184 votes were cast from voters with invalid residency these were people who did not actually live in Georgia but had their vote counted anyway remember remember the vote difference in Georgia was only 11,779 votes and just this issue alone would be 67,2 184 illegal votes there are many more bullet points about issues in the Georgia elections but I think you get the point there is a lot of evidence of election fraud in Georgia specifically in fton County so it is odd that fton county is the place that is criminally prosecuting Donald Trump for asking questions about the election it also seems like Fanny Willis is attempting to cover something up the next state is Wisconsin the vote difference was 20,625 an exception that you could vote by mail without having to show your ID this resulted in 220,00 44 votes cast from individuals who were Exempted from showing voter ID that would be incredibly easy to cheat if you never had to show an ID we are talking about a vote difference of 20,625 votes were cast without an ID this this problem really shows itself when we look at nursing homes nursing homes in Milwaukee Dayne and Racine counties had 100% turnout so you're telling me that 100% of people in nursing homes voted some people in nursing homes are nearing death so even people who were literally on their deathbeds got up and voted something just doesn't sound right to me about that in one example Merill Barrett who was 104 years old and did not recognize her own children had a ballot cast in her name in the 2020 presidential election okay now how obvious do we have to get that some funny business is going on again there are many more bullet points about issues in Wisconsin but I think you get the point the next state is Pennsylvania the vote difference in Pennsylvania was 8,555 votes now now that sounds like a lot until you find out that there were 121,50 more votes than voters Pennsylvania uses a voting system called sure the Statewide uniform registry of electors they were never able to reconcile the number of votes that were counted with the number of people who were registered to vote so the vote difference was 8,555 votes and there were 121 , 240 more votes than voters this is another example where there are many more bullet points in the report but this one fact alone raises a lot of questions for me the next state is Arizona this is the closest vote margin with only 10,457 votes Arizona did some of the most blatantly illegal things I don't know if you remember this but Arizona took a really long time to count their ballots the election took place on November 3rd well they didn't finish counting the ballots until November 30th well it turns out they were accepting and Counting ballots after the election day these were illegal votes here's a quote from the report Maricopa County accepted 20,500 mailin ballots after election day by law ballots must be received no later than 700 p.m. on Election Day which was November 3rd so the election was over the deadline was passed and they were still receiving and Counting ballots days after the election was over these are illegal votes the vote margin was 10,457 votes this one example accounts for 20,500 ballots what makes matters worse is that the meropa County elections Department withheld this information from public records requests for for 7 months after the elections no one knew this was going on until it was too late to protest the election this looks a lot like cheating also just like in the other states it looks like some of the votes were completely made up two precincts in Puma County had over 100% turnout for mailin ballots can someone in the comments please explain to me how this can happen because I'm really having a hard time understanding this how is it possible to have more than 100% of people vote how is that possible what is even more suspicious is the Arizona Secretary of State during the 2020 election was someone named Katie Hobbs she is the person responsible for running the election it turns out 2 years later she somehow became the governor of Arizona in 2022 she ran against car Lake Katie Hobbs miraculously won against all polling predictions and Katie Hobbs certified her own election count naming herself the winner ktie hobb's election is still being contested in the courts with Arizona there are many more bullet points in president Trump's report but I think you get the point the next state is Michigan the vote difference is votes now this is the largest vote difference out of the Swing States and it sounds like a lot until you find out that Michigan has 271,000 delivered in a van at 3:30 a.m. past the 8:00 p.m. deadline this was 50 boxes of ballots each containing thousands of ballots how can they count ballots that were received after the deadline when we look at the ballot counts we can see the spike that came from the suspicious ballots Michigan was also the state where we now know there was a police investigation of a company called GB bi strategies the police raided a gbi strategies office to find thousands of fraudulent voter registrations the forms were in the same handwriting and used fake addresses gbi strategies was funded by a super pack called black pack which paid the firm 11,254 n19 to register voters for Joe Biden in 2020 these people were not only only under investigation for cheating during the election they were making an awful lot of money doing it again there are many more bullet points in the report but I think you get the point so that was the report that was posted by President Trump going through the five swing states in the 2020 election again I'm not going to say whether the election was or was not stolen I want you to decide what do you think was the 2020 election stolen let me know in the comments down below and if you like this video don't forget to hit that
