The seasonal cycle of highs and lows (small peaks and valleys) is driven by Northern Hemisphere summer vegetation growth, which reduces atmospheric carbon dioxide, and winter decay, which increases it. The long-term trend of rising carbon dioxide levels is driven by human activities. At Mauna Loa, the highest monthly value each year occurs in May. In May 2024, carbon dioxide hit just under 427 ppm\u2014a new record. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on Mauna Loa monthly mean data from NOAA Global Monitoring Lab.\nBased on the annual analysis from NOAA\u2019s Global Monitoring Lab, global average atmospheric carbon dioxide was 422.8 parts per million (\u201cppm,\u201d for short) in 2024, a new record high. The increase during 2024 was 3.75 ppm\u2014the largest one-year increase on record. At Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii (graph above), where the modern carbon dioxide record began in 1958, the annual average carbon dioxide in 2024 was 424.61 ppm, also a new record.\nThe years with the largest annual carbon dioxide growth tend to be associated with the strongest El Ni\u00f1os\u2014the warm phase of a natural climate pattern in the tropical Pacific\u2014which lead to high temperatures over land and sea and an expansion of global drought area. In turn, these weather conditions typically lead to less plant growth, which reduces carbon dioxide uptake, as well as increased decomposition of carbon in soil and increased carbon dioxide emissions from forest fires. Together, these impacts cause atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to rise faster than normal.\nEven though the 2023-24 El Ni\u00f1o had waned by April, record high air temperatures and drought in all of 2024, similar to those during an El Nino, were likely drivers of the large increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide in 2024. In addition to other factors, large forest fires in both the Amazon and Canada contributed to the 2024 global increase.\nCarbon dioxide concentrations are rising mostly because of the fossil fuels that people have been burning for energy since the start of the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuels like coal and oil contain the carbon from millions of years of photosynthesis\u2014the process by which plants remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. We are returning that carbon to the atmosphere in just a few hundred years. Since the middle of the 20th century, annual emissions of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels have increased every decade, from close to 11 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year in the 1960s to an estimated 37.4 billion tons in 2024 according to the Global Carbon Budget 2024.\nThe amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (blue line) has increased along with human emissions (gray line) since the start of the Industrial Revolution in 1750. Emissions rose slowly to about 5 gigatons (1 gigaton is 1 billion metric tons per year) in the mid-20th century before rapidly increasing to more than 35 billion tons per year by the end of the century. NOAA Climate.gov graph, adapted from original by Dr. Howard Diamond (NOAA ARL). Atmospheric carbon dioxide data from NOAA and ETHZ. Carbon dioxide emissions data from Our World in Data and the Global Carbon Project.\nCarbon cycle experts estimate that natural \u201csinks,\u201d including plant growth and ocean absorption, remove about half of carbon dioxide humans emit into the atmosphere from fossil fuel burning. The rest stays in the atmosphere. Every year, we are adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than natural sinks can remove, and so the total amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere goes up. The bigger the overshoot, the faster atmospheric carbon dioxide increases.\nIn the 1960s, atmospheric carbon dioxide increased by about 0.8 ppm per year on average. That growth rate doubled to an average of 1.6 ppm per year in the 1980s and 1.5 ppm per year in the 1990s. In the last decade (2015-2024), the annual increase has accelerated to 2.6 ppm per year. As a result, the annual rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide over the past 60 years is 100-200 times faster than the increase that occurred at the end of the last ice age 11,000-17,000 years ago.\nCarbon dioxide is Earth\u2019s most important long-lived greenhouse gas: a gas that absorbs and radiates heat. Unlike oxygen or nitrogen (which make up most of Earth's atmosphere), greenhouse gases absorb heat radiating from the Earth\u2019s surface and re-release it in all directions\u2014including back toward Earth\u2019s surface. Without any carbon dioxide, Earth\u2019s natural greenhouse effect would be too weak to keep the average global surface temperature above freezing.\nBy adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, people are amplifying the natural greenhouse effect, causing global temperature to rise. According to observations and analysis by the NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory, carbon dioxide alone is responsible for about 80 percent of the total heating influence of all human-produced greenhouse gases since 1990.\nAnother reason carbon dioxide is important in the Earth system is that it dissolves into the ocean like the fizz in a can of soda. It reacts with water molecules, producing carbonic acid and lowering the ocean's pH (raising its acidity). Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, the pH of the ocean's surface waters has dropped from 8.21 to 8.10. This drop in pH is called ocean acidification, and it interferes with the ability of marine life to extract calcium from sea water to build skeletons and shells.\n(left) A healthy ocean snail has a transparent shell with smoothly contoured ridges.

The increase during 2024 was 3.75 ppm\u2014the largest one-year increase on record. At Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii (graph above), where the modern carbon dioxide record began in 1958, the annual average carbon dioxide in 2024 was 424.61 ppm, also a new record.\nThe years with the largest annual carbon dioxide growth tend to be associated with the strongest El Ni\u00f1os\u2014the warm phase of a natural climate pattern in the tropical Pacific\u2014which lead to high temperatures over land and sea and an expansion of global drought area. In turn, these weather conditions typically lead to less plant growth, which reduces carbon dioxide uptake, as well as increased decomposition of carbon in soil and increased carbon dioxide emissions from forest fires. Together, these impacts cause atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to rise faster than normal.\nEven though the 2023-24 El Ni\u00f1o had waned by April, record high air temperatures and drought in all of 2024, similar to those during an El Nino, were likely drivers of the large increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide in 2024. In addition to other factors, large forest fires in both the Amazon and Canada contributed to the 2024 global increase.\nCarbon dioxide concentrations are rising mostly because of the fossil fuels that people have been burning for energy since the start of the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuels like coal and oil contain the carbon from millions of years of photosynthesis\u2014the process by which plants remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. We are returning that carbon to the atmosphere in just a few hundred years. Since the middle of the 20th century, annual emissions of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels have increased every decade, from close to 11 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year in the 1960s to an estimated 37.4 billion tons in 2024 according to the Global Carbon Budget 2024.\nThe amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (blue line) has increased along with human emissions (gray line) since the start of the Industrial Revolution in 1750. Emissions rose slowly to about 5 gigatons (1 gigaton is 1 billion metric tons per year) in the mid-20th century before rapidly increasing to more than 35 billion tons per year by the end of the century.

Carbon dioxide emissions data from Our World in Data and the Global Carbon Project.\nCarbon cycle experts estimate that natural \u201csinks,\u201d including plant growth and ocean absorption, remove about half of carbon dioxide humans emit into the atmosphere from fossil fuel burning. The rest stays in the atmosphere. Every year, we are adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than natural sinks can remove, and so the total amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere goes up. The bigger the overshoot, the faster atmospheric carbon dioxide increases.\nIn the 1960s, atmospheric carbon dioxide increased by about 0.8 ppm per year on average. That growth rate doubled to an average of 1.6 ppm per year in the 1980s and 1.5 ppm per year in the 1990s. In the last decade (2015-2024), the annual increase has accelerated to 2.6 ppm per year. As a result, the annual rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide over the past 60 years is 100-200 times faster than the increase that occurred at the end of the last ice age 11,000-17,000 years ago.\nCarbon dioxide is Earth\u2019s most important long-lived greenhouse gas: a gas that absorbs and radiates heat. Unlike oxygen or nitrogen (which make up most of Earth's atmosphere), greenhouse gases absorb heat radiating from the Earth\u2019s surface and re-release it in all directions\u2014including back toward Earth\u2019s surface. Without any carbon dioxide, Earth\u2019s natural greenhouse effect would be too weak to keep the average global surface temperature above freezing.\nBy adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, people are amplifying the natural greenhouse effect, causing global temperature to rise. According to observations and analysis by the NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory, carbon dioxide alone is responsible for about 80 percent of the total heating influence of all human-produced greenhouse gases since 1990.\nAnother reason carbon dioxide is important in the Earth system is that it dissolves into the ocean like the fizz in a can of soda. It reacts with water molecules, producing carbonic acid and lowering the ocean's pH (raising its acidity). Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, the pH of the ocean's surface waters has dropped from 8.21 to 8.10. This drop in pH is called ocean acidification, and it interferes with the ability of marine life to extract calcium from sea water to build skeletons and shells.\n(left) A healthy ocean snail has a transparent shell with smoothly contoured ridges.

This graph shows the station's monthly average carbon dioxide measurements since 1958 in parts per million (ppm). The seasonal cycle of highs and lows (small peaks and valleys) is driven by Northern Hemisphere summer vegetation growth, which reduces atmospheric carbon dioxide, and winter decay, which increases it. The long-term trend of rising carbon dioxide levels is driven by human activities. At Mauna Loa, the highest monthly value each year occurs in May.
