To help you lose weight and get you that glow! [Music] Hey, beautiful people. It's Melissa from Choosing My Health, where I teach you how to easily transition to a whole food, plant-based lifestyle and thrive. And today we're making three of my favorite veggie juices. I love them because they're an easy way to reboot your metabolism, lose weight and cleanse your body to literally make you glow. I've been juicing for a minute and hands down, it is the easiest way to repair your body in a short span of time. But real talk, your juice gotta taste good. Cause ain't nobody want to be out here on these streets, drinking juice that tastes like dirt. I'm just going to keep it 100. Now, whether you're drinking these for a New Year's push or for three-day juice cleanse you'll find that they don't just taste good, they deliver a whole lot of life-giving nutrients to energize and revitalize your body. When I drink these literally feel like I can fly. Like that's how light I feel. And as always, if you're looking for the full recipe breakdown, I share those on my blog at choosingmyhealth.com, including modifications. I'm going to leave this link and others for you in the description box below. All right, let's get to it. [Music] I call this juice green power. It is loaded with phytonutrients and cleansing power to rid your body of excess weight and make you glow. To begin, we're gonna peel a washed lemon. I love lemons because they flush toxins from your system and purify the blood. Keep the lemon peel because it tastes great in tea and in hot porridge. Next core your washed apples. Apples are great for weight loss because they're high in pectin. Pectin binds with water and limits how much fat your cells can absorb. Isn't that cool?. They also taste great in this next cut all your ingredients into the appropriate size for your juicer. And now we're going to add all our ingredients to the juicer, kale, apple, celery. Cucumber, lime, and ginger. Each of these ingredients is especially formulated to help nourish your body. The celery, cucumber, and apples are vitamin-rich and super hydrating. Our superfood kale is rich in minerals and antioxidants to feed your cells, and lime and ginger increase your blood circulation, all while staying low in calories. You got to love this juice. [Music] Now the Beet Buzzer is my go-to juice to help me reset my body, especially when I'm feeling sluggish and need an energy boost. It's tangy, it's full-bodied and it has a lot of kick. First, peel your washed grapefruit. Grapefruits have one of the highest water contents of any food y'all, about 92% water, and they deliver a whole lot of nutrition with very little calories. We're also going to peel the lemon and cut the rest of our ingredients to an appropriate size for the juicer. Carrots- a juicing staple. Love that it's full of antioxidants including beta carotene, and lutein that are great for the eyes and beets. Beets are chocked full of nutrients and deliver maximum nutrition for your body. We're talking about potassium, magnesium, zinc, selenium. And beets also help you lower your blood pressure if you need help with that, and they give you extra stamina throughout the day. And did you know that beets even improve athletic performance? Professor: Yes, yes, and a yes-i-dy yes. If you'd allow me to just interject here for just a little bit. Beet juice, one to three hours before an athletic event can provide a one to three percent performance boost and give you a serious competitive edge. That's because beats raise nitric oxide levels increase blood flow, improve lung function and strengthen muscle contraction. Now, you know, Then lastly we add jalape\u00f1o. Jalape\u00f1os aren't a typical juice addition for me, but listen, if you can handle a little heat, jalape\u00f1o can boost your metabolism, increase fat burn and reduce your appetite. I will warn you though. It is not for you if you're sensitive to heat. And if you do like heat, very little goes a long way, my friend. So start with like one-fourth of an inch, no seeds please, then taste the juice and add more if you wish. Remember when you use this, you're juicing it. So you're getting the full undiluted effect. Alternatively, if you still want some spice without too much kick, ginger can also achieve the same purpose. [Music] Our last juice is Orange Blast. I call this my sweet treat because it's really flavorful and refreshing and super high in vitamin C, which is going to help the body absorb minerals. It's going to protect the body from chemical toxins and has anti-aging properties. Who doesn't want that? To begin let's peel a pineapple. Pineapple is perfect for detoxing because it contains bromelain, which is a digestive enzyme that will cleanse your colon and it aids digestion. And it's super juicy. Next, we'll cut a red bell pepper in half. Y'all, did you know that a cup of red bell pepper contains nearly three times more vitamin C than an orange? Professor: Oh yeah. I knew. And we're also going to add some ginger and turmeric. Ginger is awesome for circulation and digestion and turmeric, as you probably already know, is incredible for inflammation. And to maximize the benefits of turmeric, you can sprinkle a little black pepper into your drink because it can enhance the curcumin absorption in turmeric by up to 2,000 percent. That's a whole lot! This juice is extraordinarily enjoyable and will boost your immune system all while helping you flush and reset. I love these satisfying, and nutritionally-rich juices. They are perfect for a juice cleanse or for any day you need a boost. And, now if you're looking for more recipes, encouragement, plant-based education. I got you, honey. I have plenty of videos and resources on this channel and blog. I'm going to leave a link to them in the description box below. If you make any of these juices, please comment and let me know.

If you'd let me just to inter.... (Laughs) Now you know. (Laughs) Must look like I was about to choke. (Lauhgs) [Music]",

After excluding reviews/meta-analyses, animal studies, inaccessible full-text, and studies that did not supplement with beetroot juice and adequately assess cardiorespiratory endurance, 23 articles were selected for analysis. The available results suggest that supplementation with beetroot juice can improve cardiorespiratory endurance in athletes by increasing efficiency, which improves performance at various distances, increases time to exhaustion at submaximal intensities, and may improve the cardiorespiratory performance at anaerobic threshold intensities and maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max).

Cardiorespiratory endurance is a performance factor in all sports in which adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is resynthesized, mainly by aerobic metabolism or oxidative processes that produce energy. In these sports, the expended effort typically lasts longer than five minutes, primarily depending on the metabolic level of the oxidative processes involved [2]. Factors that limit performance in this type of endurance patterns include maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max), ventilatory thresholds (first and second ventilatory threshold) and energy efficiency or economy [3,4,5].\nIn competitive sports, 0.5%\u20131.5% improvements in performance are considered a critical difference [6]. In order to enhance the effects of training and improve performance, athletes often turn to nutritional supplements [7]. According to the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), adequate selection of nutrients and supplements, adjusting intake according to the exercise performed, is necessary for optimal performance in athletes [8]. However, not all supplements have been shown to produce a positive effect on performance. The Australian Institute of Sport [9], classified supplements to which athletes have access, with the goal of categorizing nutritional supplements based on the level of evidence for impact on an athlete's performance (Table 1). However, the effectiveness of supplements also depends on dosage and type of effort, because the potential ergogenic effect may differ by the specific type of sport [10].\nClassification of nutritional supplements, based on performance effect. Adapted from Australian Institute of Sport [9] and Burke [11].\nBeetroot juice is used as a supplement because of its high inorganic nitrate (NO3\u2212) content, a compound found naturally in vegetables and in processed meats, where it is used as a preservative [12].\nOnce ingested, the NO3\u2212 is reduced to nitrite (NO2\u2212), by anaerobic bacteria in the oral cavity by the action of nitrate reductase enzymes [13] and then to nitric oxide (NO) in the stomach [14]. This physiological mechanism depends on the entero-salivary circulation of inorganic nitrate without involving NOS activity. Once in the acidic stomach, nitrite is instantly decomposed to convert to NO and other nitrogen oxides performing determinant physiological functions (Figure 1). Nitrate and remaining nitrite is absorbed from the intestine into the circulation, which can become bioactive NO in tissues and blood [14] under physiological hypoxia.\nPathway of nitric oxide (NO) production from beetroot juice supplementation. Nitrate (NO3\u2212) is reduced to nitrite (NO2\u2212) by anaerobic bacteria in the oral cavity and then to NO in the stomach.

Physiological mechanisms for NO2\u2212 reduction are facilitated by hypoxic conditions, therefore, NO (vasodilator) is produced in those parts of muscle that are consuming or in need of more O2. This mechanism would allow local blood flow to adapt to O2 requirement providing within skeletal muscle an adequate homogeneous distribution. This physiological response could be positive in terms of muscle function, although it would not explain a reduced O2 cost during exercise [15]. Another probable mechanism is related to NO2\u2212 and NO as regulators of cellular O2 utilizati\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

Cardiorespiratory endurance is a performance factor in all sports in which adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is resynthesized, mainly by aerobic metabolism or oxidative processes that produce energy. In these sports, the expended effort typically lasts longer than five minutes, primarily depending on the metabolic level of the oxidative processes involved [2]. Factors that limit performance in this type of endurance patterns include maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max), ventilatory thresholds (first and second ventilatory threshold) and energy efficiency or economy [3,4,5].\nIn competitive sports, 0.5%\u20131.5% improvements in performance are considered a critical difference [6]. In order to enhance the effects of training and improve performance, athletes often turn to nutritional supplements [7].

After excluding reviews/meta-analyses, animal studies, inaccessible full-text, and studies that did not supplement with beetroot juice and adequately assess cardiorespiratory endurance, 23 articles were selected for analysis. The available results suggest that supplementation with beetroot juice can improve cardiorespiratory endurance in athletes by increasing efficiency, which improves performance at various distances, increases time to exhaustion at submaximal intensities, and may improve the cardiorespiratory performance at anaerobic threshold intensities and maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max). Although the literature shows contradictory data, the findings of other studies lead us to hypothesize that supplementing with beetroot juice could mitigate the ergolytic effects of hypoxia on cardiorespiratory endurance in athletes. It cannot be stated that the combination of beetroot juice with other supplements has a positive or negative effect on cardiorespiratory endurance, but it is possible that the effects of supplementation with beetroot juice can be undermined by interaction with other supplements such as caffeine.\nKeywords: nutrition, sport, exercise, nitric oxide, physical activity\nCardiorespiratory endurance is defined as a health-related component of physical fitness that relates to the ability of the circulatory and respiratory systems to supply fuel during sustained physical activity and to eliminate fatigue products after supplying fuel [1]. Cardiorespiratory endurance is a performance factor in all sports in which adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is resynthesized, mainly by aerobic metabolism or oxidative processes that produce energy. In these sports, the expended effort typically lasts longer than five minutes, primarily depending on the metabolic level of the oxidative processes involved [2]. Factors that limit performance in this type of endurance patterns include maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max), ventilatory thresholds (first and second ventilatory threshold) and energy efficiency or economy [3,4,5].\nIn competitive sports, 0.5%\u20131.5% improvements in performance are considered a critical difference [6]. In order to enhance the effects of training and improve performance, athletes often turn to nutritional supplements [7]. According to the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), adequate selection of nutrients and supplements, adjusting intake according to the exercise performed, is necessary for optimal performance in athletes [8]. However, not all supplements have been shown to produce a positive effect on performance. The Australian Institute of Sport [9], classified supplements to which athletes have access, with the goal of categorizing nutritional supplements based on the level of evidence for impact on an athlete's performance (Table 1). However, the effectiveness of supplements also depends on dosage and type of effort, because the potential ergogenic effect may differ by the specific type of sport [10].\nClassification of nutritional supplements, based on performance effect. Adapted from Australian Institute of Sport [9] and Burke [11].\nBeetroot juice is used as a supplement because of its high inorganic nitrate (NO3\u2212) content, a compound found naturally in vegetables and in processed meats, where it is used as a preservative [12].\nOnce ingested, the NO3\u2212 is reduced to nitrite (NO2\u2212), by anaerobic bacteria in the oral cavity by the action of nitrate reductase enzymes [13] and then to nitric oxide (NO) in the stomach [14]. This physiological mechanism depends on the entero-salivary circulation of inorganic nitrate without involving NOS activity. Once in the acidic stomach, nitrite is instantly decomposed to convert to NO and other nitrogen oxides performing determinant physiological functions (Figure 1). Nitrate and remaining nitrite is absorbed from the intestine into the circulation, which can become bioactive NO in tissues and blood [14] under physiological hypoxia.\nPathway of nitric oxide (NO) production from beetroot juice supplementation. Nitrate (NO3\u2212) is reduced to nitrite (NO2\u2212) by anaerobic bacteria in the oral cavity and then to NO in the stomach. NO3\u2212 and remaining NO2\u2212 are absorbed from the intestine into the circulation, which can become bioactive NO in tissues and blood. NO induces several physiological functions improving skeletal muscle function and, consequently, increasing cardiorespiratory performance.\nNO induces several physiological mechanisms that influences O2 utilization during contraction skeletal muscle. Physiological mechanisms for NO2\u2212 reduction are facilitated by hypoxic conditions, therefore, NO (vasodilator) is produced in those parts of muscle that are consuming or in need of more O2. This mechanism would allow local blood flow to adapt to O2 requirement providing within skeletal muscle an adequate homogeneous distribution. This physiological response could be positive in terms of muscle function, although it would not explain a reduced O2 cost during exercise [15]. Another probable mechanism is related to NO2\u2212 and NO as regulators of cellular O2 utilizati\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",
