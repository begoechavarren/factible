HIV infects and deletes CD4+ T cells that normally coordinate the adaptive T- and B-cell response to defend against intracellular pathogens. The immune defect is immediate and profound: At the time of acute infection with an AIDS virus, typically more than half of the gut-associated CD4+ T cells are depleted, leaving a damaged immune system to contend with a life-long infection.\nAt the time of acute HIV infection, more than half of the gut-associated CD4+ T cells are depleted, leaving a damaged immune system to contend with a life-long infection.\nThe earliest studies of T-cell function among infected persons revealed aspects of HIV immunopathogenesis that are still not fully understood. Despite initial and persistent damage to CD4+ T cells, and a lack of detectable HIV-specific CD4+ T helper cells (Murray et al. 1984; Lane et al. 1985), the magnitude and breadth of CD8+ T-cell responses to HIV in infected humans were found to be robust, with direct effector function of such a magnitude that it could be readily detected in freshly isolated lymphocytes from peripheral blood and brochoalveolar lavage in persons with AIDS (Plata et al. 1987; Walker et al. 1987; Nixon et al. 1988). HIV was already known to be an immunosuppressive disease, yet these cells were present in such robust quantity that they could be detected by assays measuring the ability of freshly isolated peripheral blood cells to lyse autologous B cells infected with recombinant vaccinia-HIV vectors or peptide pulsed targets (Walker et al. 1987; Nixon et al. 1988). Moreover, CD8+ T cells from infected persons were able to inhibit HIV replication (Walker et al. 1986), clearly showing that these cells were functional at least in vitro, but despite this, persons were progressing to AIDS.\nSubsequent studies using other approaches such as interferon \u03b3 Elispot (Dalod et al. 1999), intracellular cytokine (Maecker et al. 2001), and peptide MHC tetramer assays (Altman et al. 1996) confirmed and quantified these robust CD8+ T-cell responses. Most chronically infected persons target more than a dozen CD8+ epitopes simultaneously (Addo et al. 2003), and in some instances up to 19% of CD8+ T cells are specific for HIV (Richardson 2000; Betts et al. 2001; Papagno et al. 2002), yet control of viremia is not achieved. At the same time, HIV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses were found to be severely impaired, particularly as measured by the ability of these cells to proliferate to viral antigens (Wahren et al. 1987). Thus, from the early studies there was a clear disconnect between the lack of HIV-specific CD4+ T cells and the abundance of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells.\nDespite these conundrums, there were early signs that CD8+ T cells play a role in controlling HIV disease progression. Sequencing of autologous virus from infected persons revealed evidence of immune selection pressure mediated by these responses (Phillips et al. 1991) and an association with the initial decline in peak viremia after acute infection (Borrow et al. 1994; Koup et al. 1994). The development of HLA-class I-peptide tetramers confirmed the presence of robust induction of responses to multiple epitopes (Altman et al. 1996), and as larger numbers of patients were studied, it also became clear that among the strongest associations with disease outcome was the expression of certain HLA class I alleles (Kaslow et al. 1996; Migueles et al. 2000; Gao et al. 2001), implicating class I restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) as a major modulator of disease progression. The relationship between CD8+ T-cell immune function and viral control was shown by experimental depletion of CD8+ T cells in animal models of AIDS virus infection (Jin et al. 1999; Schmitz et al. 1999). As sensitive viral load assays became available, it also became clear that some infected persons were able to control viremia to levels below detection by the most sensitive RNA assays, and that these persons were characterized by robust HIV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses (Rosenberg et al. 1997). However, now a quarter century into the epidemic the precise role of T cells in HIV control, and the precise phenotype, specificity and function of T cells that should be induced with a vaccine, remain unclear. And from the standpoint of vaccine development, it remains controversial as to how much insight is to be gained from the study of persons who have become infected, because by definition these are not protective responses.\nAcute HIV infection is often associated with a transient febrile illness, much like infectious mononucleosis (Ho et al. 1985), which has facilitated the identification of persons in the earliest stages of infection, who are HIV RNA positive but not yet HIV antibody positive. Important justification for the intense study of acute infection is the demonstration that early events predict subsequent disease progression (Mellors et al. 1996; Lyles et al. 2000). Acute infection is associated with a decline in peak viremia from \u223c1\u20135 million viral copies/mL to a steady state of \u223c30,000 copies (Lyles et al. 2000), but peak levels of viremia may be much lower in asymptomatic persons (Fiebig et al. 2003). Very few studies have actually examined CD8+ T-cell responses in the earliest stages of infection (Fiebig stage I and II), but when those studies have been performed it is clear that initial immune responses are very narrowly directed (Goonetilleke et al. 2009) and remain narrowly directed as viral set point is achieved (Dalod et al. 1999; Altfeld et al. 2001).

It destroys CD4 cells, causing your white blood cell count to drop.\n\nFull Page Content:\nAn official website of the United States government\nHIV is a disease in which the original clinical observations of severe opportunistic infections gave the first clues regarding the underlying pathology, namely that HIV is essentially an infection of the immune system. HIV infects and deletes CD4+ T cells that normally coordinate the adaptive T- and B-cell response to defend against intracellular pathogens. The immune defect is immediate and profound: At the time of acute infection with an AIDS virus, typically more than half of the gut-associated CD4+ T cells are depleted, leaving a damaged immune system to contend with a life-long infection.\nAt the time of acute HIV infection, more than half of the gut-associated CD4+ T cells are depleted, leaving a damaged immune system to contend with a life-long infection.\nThe earliest studies of T-cell function among infected persons revealed aspects of HIV immunopathogenesis that are still not fully understood. Despite initial and persistent damage to CD4+ T cells, and a lack of detectable HIV-specific CD4+ T helper cells (Murray et al. 1984; Lane et al. 1985), the magnitude and breadth of CD8+ T-cell responses to HIV in infected humans were found to be robust, with direct effector function of such a magnitude that it could be readily detected in freshly isolated lymphocytes from peripheral blood and brochoalveolar lavage in persons with AIDS (Plata et al. 1987; Walker et al. 1987; Nixon et al. 1988). HIV was already known to be an immunosuppressive disease, yet these cells were present in such robust quantity that they could be detected by assays measuring the ability of freshly isolated peripheral blood cells to lyse autologous B cells infected with recombinant vaccinia-HIV vectors or peptide pulsed targets (Walker et al. 1987; Nixon et al. 1988). Moreover, CD8+ T cells from infected persons were able to inhibit HIV replication (Walker et al. 1986), clearly showing that these cells were functional at least in vitro, but despite this, persons were progressing to AIDS.\nSubsequent studies using other approaches such as interferon \u03b3 Elispot (Dalod et al. 1999), intracellular cytokine (Maecker et al. 2001), and peptide MHC tetramer assays (Altman et al. 1996) confirmed and quantified these robust CD8+ T-cell responses. Most chronically infected persons target more than a dozen CD8+ epitopes simultaneously (Addo et al. 2003), and in some instances up to 19% of CD8+ T cells are specific for HIV (Richardson 2000; Betts et al. 2001; Papagno et al. 2002), yet control of viremia is not achieved. At the same time, HIV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses were found to be severely impaired, particularly as measured by the ability of these cells to proliferate to viral antigens (Wahren et al. 1987). Thus, from the early studies there was a clear disconnect between the lack of HIV-specific CD4+ T cells and the abundance of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells.\nDespite these conundrums, there were early signs that CD8+ T cells play a role in controlling HIV disease progression. Sequencing of autologous virus from infected persons revealed evidence of immune selection pressure mediated by these responses (Phillips et al. 1991) and an association with the initial decline in peak viremia after acute infection (Borrow et al. 1994; Koup et al. 1994). The development of HLA-class I-peptide tetramers confirmed the presence of robust induction of responses to multiple epitopes (Altman et al. 1996), and as larger numbers of patients were studied, it also became clear that among the strongest associations with disease outcome was the expression of certain HLA class I alleles (Kaslow et al. 1996; Migueles et al. 2000; Gao et al. 2001), implicating class I restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) as a major modulator of disease progression. The relationship between CD8+ T-cell immune function and viral control was shown by experimental depletion of CD8+ T cells in animal models of AIDS virus infection (Jin et al. 1999; Schmitz et al. 1999). As sensitive viral load assays became available, it also became clear that some infected persons were able to control viremia to levels below detection by the most sensitive RNA assays, and that these persons were characterized by robust HIV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses (Rosenberg et al. 1997). However, now a quarter century into the epidemic the precise role of T cells in HIV control, and the precise phenotype, specificity and function of T cells that should be induced with a vaccine, remain unclear. And from the standpoint of vaccine development, it remains controversial as to how much insight is to be gained from the study of persons who have become infected, because by definition these are not protective responses.\nAcute HIV infection is often associated with a transient febrile illness, much like infectious mononucleosis (Ho et al. 1985), which has facilitated the identification of persons in the earliest stages of infection, who are HIV RNA positive but not yet HIV antibody positive. Important justification for the intense study of acute infection is the demonstration that early events predict subsequent disease progression (Mellors et al. 1996; Lyles et al. 2000). Acute infection is associated with a decline in peak viremia from \u223c1\u20135 million viral copies/mL to a steady state of \u223c30,000 copies (Lyles et al. 2000), but peak levels of viremia may be much lower in asymptomatic persons (Fiebig et al. 2003). Very few studies have actually examined CD8+ T-cell responses in the earliest stages of infection (Fiebig stage I and II), but when those studies have been performed it is clear that initial immune responses are very narrowly directed (Goonetilleke et al. 2009) and remain narrowly directed as viral set point is achieved (Dalod et al. 1999; Altfeld et al. 2001). Even when responses to autologous virus are measured, the initial detectable response has usually been to only one to three epitopes (Goonetilleke et al. 2009), even though the autologou\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",

HIV spreads through contact with bodily fluids including blood, semen, vaginal fluids, and breastmilk. This means HIV can spread through activities such as unprotected sex, sharing needles or syringes, or from mother to baby.\nOnce HIV enters the body, it infects T helper cells (also known as CD4 T cells). When HIV enters a T helper cell, it permanently inserts its viral DNA into the cell\u2019s DNA. The virus has now hijacked the T helper cell, using it to make more copies of the virus. The viral DNA from HIV also becomes permanently part of an infected T helper cell\u2019s DNA. This makes it very difficult for the immune system to find and kill the virus. Because of HIV\u2019s ability to quickly hide within your cells and because it mutates very often, developing a vaccine to prevent HIV is very challenging.\nThe first stage of HIV infection is called acute HIV. This is when someone is first infected with HIV and may experience mild flu-like symptoms or no symptoms at all. This can then progress to chronic infection where HIV will continue to replicate inside T helper cells, slowly killing them and infecting more cells. At this stage, it\u2019s likely that the infected person won\u2019t experience any noticeable symptoms. During this time, they can still transmit HIV, even if they don\u2019t realize they have it.\nHIV infection can affect anyone. To learn more or be tested for the virus, talk to a doctor or visit a local health clinic.\nThe final stage of HIV infection is acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). This is when the number of T helper cells becomes very low. This happens years after initial infection and the immune system has been severely weakened by the virus. The T helper cells that HIV infects and destroys are crucial for activating other immune cells to coordinate an immune response. As the number of T helper cells decreases, the immune system becomes weaker, unable to fight off simple infections or prevent the development of cancer.\nA person with AIDS is more likely to get opportunistic infections, which are infections a healthy immune system could normally prevent. They are also more likely to develop certain types of cancer. These infections and cancers are called AIDS-defining illnesses. They occur because the T helper cells that are supposed to help initiate immune responses are too weak to respond. Some examples include Kaposi sarcoma, tuberculosis, or chronic herpes ulcers.\nHIV treatment and prevention have come a long way, but there is no cure. Today, HIV treatment can prevent HIV infection from progressing to AIDS. When taking HIV treatment as prescribed, many people live long lives. Treatment can even reduce HIV to undetectable levels in person, meaning there is so little virus active in your blood that a test cannot detect it. This doesn\u2019t mean you are cured, but it does mean your treatment is working very effectively. Researchers have even determined that when HIV levels are undetectable and stay undetectable, the virus cannot be transmitted. Immunology research over the last 40 years contributed to these major advancements in HIV treatment that allow people to live decades with little to no symptoms of HIV infection.\nImmunology research is continuing to advance HIV treatments and even help find a cure for the infection. Immunotherapy, treatment that enhances the immune system\u2019s ability to fight disease, is providing promise for people with HIV. A study in 2022, found that a cancer immunotherapy, pembrolizumab, can reverse HIV\u2019s ability to hide in immune cells. The virus\u2019s ability to hide is a major barrier to curing HIV, and immunotherapies like this may be a key step in reaching a cure.\nmRNA vaccines are also showing incredible promise in curing HIV. One study found that mRNA can be delivered to the cells where HIV is hiding and provide instructions to the cell that reveal the virus. Being able to reveal the virus and prevent it from hiding can lead to drugs that permanently eliminate HIV from the body.

When HIV enters a T helper cell, it permanently inserts its viral DNA into the cell\u2019s DNA. The virus has now hijacked the T helper cell, using it to make more copies of the virus. The viral DNA from HIV also becomes permanently part of an infected T helper cell\u2019s DNA. This makes it very difficult for the immune system to find and kill the virus. Because of HIV\u2019s ability to quickly hide within your cells and because it mutates very often, developing a vaccine to prevent HIV is very challenging.\nThe first stage of HIV infection is called acute HIV. This is when someone is first infected with HIV and may experience mild flu-like symptoms or no symptoms at all. This can then progress to chronic infection where HIV will continue to replicate inside T helper cells, slowly killing them and infecting more cells. At this stage, it\u2019s likely that the infected person won\u2019t experience any noticeable symptoms. During this time, they can still transmit HIV, even if they don\u2019t realize they have it.\nHIV infection can affect anyone. To learn more or be tested for the virus, talk to a doctor or visit a local health clinic.\nThe final stage of HIV infection is acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). This is when the number of T helper cells becomes very low. This happens years after initial infection and the immune system has been severely weakened by the virus. The T helper cells that HIV infects and destroys are crucial for activating other immune cells to coordinate an immune response. As the number of T helper cells decreases, the immune system becomes weaker, unable to fight off simple infections or prevent the development of cancer.\nA person with AIDS is more likely to get opportunistic infections, which are infections a healthy immune system could normally prevent. They are also more likely to develop certain types of cancer. These infections and cancers are called AIDS-defining illnesses. They occur because the T helper cells that are supposed to help initiate immune responses are too weak to respond. Some examples include Kaposi sarcoma, tuberculosis, or chronic herpes ulcers.\nHIV treatment and prevention have come a long way, but there is no cure. Today, HIV treatment can prevent HIV infection from progressing to AIDS. When taking HIV treatment as prescribed, many people live long lives. Treatment can even reduce HIV to undetectable levels in person, meaning there is so little virus active in your blood that a test cannot detect it. This doesn\u2019t mean you are cured, but it does mean your treatment is working very effectively. Researchers have even determined that when HIV levels are undetectable and stay undetectable, the virus cannot be transmitted. Immunology research over the last 40 years contributed to these major advancements in HIV treatment that allow people to live decades with little to no symptoms of HIV infection.\nImmunology research is continuing to advance HIV treatments and even help find a cure for the infection. Immunotherapy, treatment that enhances the immune system\u2019s ability to fight disease, is providing promise for people with HIV. A study in 2022, found that a cancer immunotherapy, pembrolizumab, can reverse HIV\u2019s ability to hide in immune cells. The virus\u2019s ability to hide is a major barrier to curing HIV, and immunotherapies like this may be a key step in reaching a cure.\nmRNA vaccines are also showing incredible promise in curing HIV. One study found that mRNA can be delivered to the cells where HIV is hiding and provide instructions to the cell that reveal the virus. Being able to reveal the virus and prevent it from hiding can lead to drugs that permanently eliminate HIV from the body. Another study using mRNA vaccines, successfully trained the immune system to recognize and fight HIV, a major battle in developing successful HIV vaccines. With continued advances in immunology and personalized medicine, researchers hope new technology like mRNA vaccines and immunotherpay will finally lead to a cure for HIV.\nThe American Association of Immunologists (\u201cAAI\u201d) websites (www.aai.org, www.immunologyexplained.org, and all related webpages, the \u201cWebsites\u201d) include information meant to inform visitors (\u201cUsers\u201d) about immunology and its related disciplines.

HIV infects and deletes CD4+ T cells that normally coordinate the adaptive T- and B-cell response to defend against intracellular pathogens. The immune defect is immediate and profound: At the time of acute infection with an AIDS virus, typically more than half of the gut-associated CD4+ T cells are depleted, leaving a damaged immune system to contend with a life-long infection.\nAt the time of acute HIV infection, more than half of the gut-associated CD4+ T cells are depleted, leaving a damaged immune system to contend with a life-long infection.\nThe earliest studies of T-cell function among infected persons revealed aspects of HIV immunopathogenesis that are still not fully understood. Despite initial and persistent damage to CD4+ T cells, and a lack of detectable HIV-specific CD4+ T helper cells (Murray et al. 1984; Lane et al. 1985), the magnitude and breadth of CD8+ T-cell responses to HIV in infected humans were found to be robust, with direct effector function of such a magnitude that it could be readily detected in freshly isolated lymphocytes from peripheral blood and brochoalveolar lavage in persons with AIDS (Plata et al. 1987; Walker et al. 1987; Nixon et al. 1988). HIV was already known to be an immunosuppressive disease, yet these cells were present in such robust quantity that they could be detected by assays measuring the ability of freshly isolated peripheral blood cells to lyse autologous B cells infected with recombinant vaccinia-HIV vectors or peptide pulsed targets (Walker et al. 1987; Nixon et al. 1988). Moreover, CD8+ T cells from infected persons were able to inhibit HIV replication (Walker et al. 1986), clearly showing that these cells were functional at least in vitro, but despite this, persons were progressing to AIDS.\nSubsequent studies using other approaches such as interferon \u03b3 Elispot (Dalod et al. 1999), intracellular cytokine (Maecker et al. 2001), and peptide MHC tetramer assays (Altman et al. 1996) confirmed and quantified these robust CD8+ T-cell responses. Most chronically infected persons target more than a dozen CD8+ epitopes simultaneously (Addo et al. 2003), and in some instances up to 19% of CD8+ T cells are specific for HIV (Richardson 2000; Betts et al. 2001; Papagno et al. 2002), yet control of viremia is not achieved. At the same time, HIV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses were found to be severely impaired, particularly as measured by the ability of these cells to proliferate to viral antigens (Wahren et al. 1987). Thus, from the early studies there was a clear disconnect between the lack of HIV-specific CD4+ T cells and the abundance of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells.\nDespite these conundrums, there were early signs that CD8+ T cells play a role in controlling HIV disease progression. Sequencing of autologous virus from infected persons revealed evidence of immune selection pressure mediated by these responses (Phillips et al. 1991) and an association with the initial decline in peak viremia after acute infection (Borrow et al. 1994; Koup et al. 1994). The development of HLA-class I-peptide tetramers confirmed the presence of robust induction of responses to multiple epitopes (Altman et al. 1996), and as larger numbers of patients were studied, it also became clear that among the strongest associations with disease outcome was the expression of certain HLA class I alleles (Kaslow et al. 1996; Migueles et al. 2000; Gao et al. 2001), implicating class I restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) as a major modulator of disease progression. The relationship between CD8+ T-cell immune function and viral control was shown by experimental depletion of CD8+ T cells in animal models of AIDS virus infection (Jin et al. 1999; Schmitz et al. 1999). As sensitive viral load assays became available, it also became clear that some infected persons were able to control viremia to levels below detection by the most sensitive RNA assays, and that these persons were characterized by robust HIV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses (Rosenberg et al. 1997). However, now a quarter century into the epidemic the precise role of T cells in HIV control, and the precise phenotype, specificity and function of T cells that should be induced with a vaccine, remain unclear. And from the standpoint of vaccine development, it remains controversial as to how much insight is to be gained from the study of persons who have become infected, because by definition these are not protective responses.\nAcute HIV infection is often associated with a transient febrile illness, much like infectious mononucleosis (Ho et al. 1985), which has facilitated the identification of persons in the earliest stages of infection, who are HIV RNA positive but not yet HIV antibody positive. Important justification for the intense study of acute infection is the demonstration that early events predict subsequent disease progression (Mellors et al. 1996; Lyles et al. 2000). Acute infection is associated with a decline in peak viremia from \u223c1\u20135 million viral copies/mL to a steady state of \u223c30,000 copies (Lyles et al. 2000), but peak levels of viremia may be much lower in asymptomatic persons (Fiebig et al. 2003). Very few studies have actually examined CD8+ T-cell responses in the earliest stages of infection (Fiebig stage I and II), but when those studies have been performed it is clear that initial immune responses are very narrowly directed (Goonetilleke et al. 2009) and remain narrowly directed as viral set point is achieved (Dalod et al. 1999; Altfeld et al. 2001). Even when responses to autologous virus are measured, the initial detectable response has usually been to only one to three epitopes (Goonetilleke et al. 2009), even though the autologou\n\nProvide relevant evidence.",
