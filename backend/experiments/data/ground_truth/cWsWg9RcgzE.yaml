video_duration_seconds: 705
claims:
- claim_text: AIDS was a guaranteed death sentence not so long ago
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.75
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: WHO confirms that with no effective treatment in the 1980s, HIV diagnosis meant little hope and certain death within years. CDC data shows 100,777 AIDS deaths from 1981-1990 in the US alone. By 1988, it was the third leading cause of death among men 25-44. The first ART medication (AZT, 1987) had limited effectiveness, with effective combination therapy (HAART) only arriving in 1996.
- claim_text: The infection rate of HIV in Australia plummeted following shock advertising campaigns in the 1980s
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.65
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: The 1987 Grim Reaper campaign is regarded as effective despite being controversial. HIV diagnoses dropped from mid-1980s peaks to 656 cases by 2000. Australia's swift government response in partnership with NGOs achieved and maintained low HIV infection rates compared to global standards.
- claim_text: The infection rate of HIV in Australia has shot up again
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.8
  verdict:
    overall_stance: MIXED
    reasoning: 'After dropping to 656 cases in 2000, rates rose to 930 by 2005 and peaked at 1,236 in 2013. However, recent data shows a declining trend: 1,079 (2014) to 552 (2021) to 722 (2023). Kirby Institute 2024 confirms diagnoses have followed a downward trend over the last decade. The video likely dates from 2010-2015 when rates had indeed increased from the 2000 low.'
- claim_text: Straight women are now among the most vulnerable groups for HIV infection in Australia
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.85
  verdict:
    overall_stance: REFUTES
    reasoning: Sexual transmission between men accounts for 68% of newly diagnosed HIV (2013-2017), rising to 82% of newly acquired infections. Heterosexual contact accounts for only 25% of diagnoses. Women make up only 11-12% of all people living with HIV in Australia, and 90% of new diagnoses are males. MSM remain by far the most affected group. The claim that straight women are "most vulnerable" is factually incorrect.
- claim_text: Alarmingly, 1,000 Australians a year are now diagnosed with HIV
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.7
  verdict:
    overall_stance: REFUTES
    reasoning: 'Recent data shows 722 new diagnoses in 2023, 553 in 2022, and 552 in 2021 (lowest ever). While the video may have been accurate when filmed (2009: 1,050; 2013: 1,236), the present-tense claim overstates current annual diagnoses by 28-81%.'
- claim_text: The infection rate of HIV in Australia is almost double what it was 10 years ago
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.75
  verdict:
    overall_stance: REFUTES
    reasoning: Kirby Institute data shows diagnoses reduced by 33% over the last decade, with a 64% reduction among Australian-born gay and bisexual men. The claim may reference comparing 2000 (656 cases) to 2009 (1,050 cases), a 60% increase. However, from any recent 10-year window, rates have declined, not doubled.
- claim_text: 98% of new HIV infections among the women in the documentary were contracted through heterosexual sex
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.6
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: US CDC 2022 shows 83% of female HIV infections were attributed to heterosexual contact. Australian data confirms heterosexual sex as the predominant transmission route for women. The remaining percentage typically includes injection drug use (17% in US). The 98% figure aligns with heterosexual sex being the primary transmission route for women.
- claim_text: Deanna Bleg contracted HIV from unprotected sex with a former boyfriend 16 years ago
  is_checkable: false
  importance: 0.2
  verdict:
    overall_stance: UNCLEAR
    reasoning: This is a personal anecdote about a specific individual.
- claim_text: Deanna lost about 20 kilos over a period of 6 weeks when she first had symptoms
  is_checkable: false
  importance: 0.15
  verdict:
    overall_stance: UNCLEAR
    reasoning: Personal medical history that cannot be independently verified.
- claim_text: Within months of diagnosis, Deanna's HIV had progressed to AIDS
  is_checkable: false
  importance: 0.25
  verdict:
    overall_stance: UNCLEAR
    reasoning: Individual case history that cannot be verified through public sources.
- claim_text: Deanna was on almost 30 pills a day for HIV treatment in the early 1990s
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.55
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Early ART before 1996 HAART was less effective and involved multiple toxic medications requiring numerous daily pills. This aligns with documented medical practice from the early HIV treatment era. Modern regimens typically involve 1-3 pills daily.
- claim_text: 30 years ago, HIV was universally a death sentence
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.75
  verdict:
    overall_stance: MIXED
    reasoning: WHO confirms there was little hope in the 1980s with no effective treatment. AZT (1987) had limited effectiveness, with HAART only available from 1996. Over 448,000 AIDS deaths occurred in the US from early 1980s to end of 1990s. However, the word "universally" is problematic. Death rates declined from 78% (1988-1995) to around 5% as ART emerged. Survival varied by access to treatment and individual factors. While extremely deadly 30 years ago, calling it "universally" a death sentence overlooks regional care variations and emerging treatments by mid-1990s.
- claim_text: People with HIV are now leading almost normal lives with improved prognosis
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.85
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Lancet HIV 2023 shows people on ART with high CD4 counts have life expectancy only a few years lower than the general population. Cleveland Clinic confirms most people who start ART soon after diagnosis can expect to live as long as someone without HIV. U=U (Undetectable = Untransmittable) means effective ART prevents sexual transmission.
- claim_text: People with HIV still have to take tablets every day and there are still side effects
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.7
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: NIH guidelines confirm ART requires lifelong daily adherence. Modern regimens typically involve 1-3 pills daily. Side effects include mood changes, sleep difficulties, weight gain, metabolic issues, and cardiovascular risks. Long-term ART is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and osteoporosis.
- claim_text: HIV drugs are creating new health issues including heart disease, diabetes, and lipid problems
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.75
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: PMC review 2018 confirms people with HIV face increased risk of cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorders, and renal complications. These result from people living longer with HIV plus chronic inflammation and ART toxicity. NIH notes many people with HIV experience age-related comorbidities. Professor Sharon Leuen in the video confirms seeing "a lot of heart disease, diabetes, lipid problems.".
- claim_text: There's a widely held perception that the battle against HIV has been won, creating dangerous complacency
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.8
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Professor Sharon Leuen states that improved prognosis means "people aren't as scared of HIV as they were before." Public health experts express concern that reduced awareness leads to risky behavior, and improved prognosis has paradoxically reduced preventive vigilance in some populations.
- claim_text: People have to be in regular medical care on treatment lifelong
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.7
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: NIH guidelines recommend regular CD4 counts, viral load testing, metabolic panels, and clinical follow-up. Adherence is critical as missing doses can lead to viral rebound and drug resistance. Continuous care is needed to maintain viral suppression and monitor for complications.
- claim_text: One challenge for HIV positive women is motherhood, with a very slim chance the virus could be passed on
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.75
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Mother-to-child transmission risk is less than 1% with ART. Australian data shows only 5 vertical transmissions in a 5-year period (1.8% of exposures), and UK data shows <0.5% with treatment. Proper ART during pregnancy, delivery procedures, and infant prophylaxis virtually eliminate transmission risk.
- claim_text: Professor Sharon Leuen and her teams made a breakthrough discovering where HIV cells hide in the body
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.6
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Professor Sharon Lewin is a recognized HIV researcher who leads research at the Doherty Institute. Her teams have published significant work on HIV latency and viral reservoirs, which is a major focus of cure research. The claim aligns with documented research on viral reservoirs.
- claim_text: HIV is a really clever virus that can change all the time, evade the immune system and drugs, and hide in small pockets of the body
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.75
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: HIV is a retrovirus with a high mutation rate, leading to drug resistance if treatment is inconsistent. It establishes latent reservoirs in CD4+ T cells where it remains dormant and integrates into host DNA, making complete elimination extremely difficult. HIV's ability to evade immune responses and establish persistence is documented.
- claim_text: About half of men with known HIV history were diagnosed through sexual health screens, but women's HIV was mostly detected through targeted screening
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.65
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: PMC study 2022 confirms nearly half of men were diagnosed through sexual health screens, while women's HIV was mostly detected through targeted screening. Men access sexual health clinics for routine STI screening more frequently, while women are often diagnosed during pregnancy testing or when symptomatic, highlighting lower sexual health risk awareness among heterosexual women.
- claim_text: Sarah was 24 years old and diagnosed with HIV in 2008
  is_checkable: false
  importance: 0.15
  verdict:
    overall_stance: UNCLEAR
    reasoning: Personal information about specific individual that cannot be verified.
- claim_text: Sarah was taught nothing about HIV in school as a young heterosexual
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.6
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: US data shows sex education on HIV prevention decreased from 64% (2000) to 41% (2014). 26 states emphasize abstinence-only education, which is correlated with increasing HIV/AIDS infection rates. The claim reflects documented gaps in complete sexual health education for heterosexual young people.
- claim_text: Medical advances mean HIV can now be managed with proper treatment but it's a long hard road
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.75
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Modern ART can suppress viral load to undetectable levels with high adherence. However, treatment is lifelong with daily medication and side effects. Patients face mental health challenges, stigma, and long-term health complications. While prognosis is vastly improved, the characterization as a "long hard road" is supported by patient experiences and medical literature.
- claim_text: Sarah faces a lifetime of powerful medication for HIV
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.7
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: There is currently no cure for HIV; ART must be continued indefinitely. Stopping medication leads to viral rebound and disease progression. Modern medications are less toxic than early drugs but still require continuous lifelong use.
- claim_text: There is still enormous stigma surrounding HIV today, with people telling Sarah she should die and is disgusting
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.75
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Karl Schmid states "much of the fear and stigma that surrounded the AIDS epidemic of the 1980's and 1990's still exists." WHO identifies stigma as "a fundamental barrier in fighting HIV." Research shows HIV-positive people face discrimination, social isolation, and verbal abuse, with women reporting unwanted disclosure and discrimination.
- claim_text: Professor Sharon Lewin coordinates three research teams at Melbourne's Alfred Hospital, Monash University, and the Burnet Institute
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.4
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Professor Sharon Lewin holds leadership positions at the Doherty Institute and University of Melbourne, with affiliations at major Australian research institutions working on HIV. The specific institutional affiliations can be verified through academic records.
- claim_text: HIV cells hide in the body and can go to sleep in some cells in small pockets - it was a needle in a haystack discovery
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.7
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: HIV integrates into host cell DNA and can remain dormant for years in resting CD4+ T cells and other cell types. These reservoirs are difficult to detect and target, making cure challenging. Identifying specific reservoir locations was a significant research achievement, supporting the "needle in a haystack" characterization.
- claim_text: Deanna Bleg has lived 11 years longer than doctors predicted
  is_checkable: false
  importance: 0.25
  verdict:
    overall_stance: UNCLEAR
    reasoning: Individual prognostic claim that cannot be independently verified.
- claim_text: Deanna thought she had just months to live but is now 41 years old
  is_checkable: false
  importance: 0.2
  verdict:
    overall_stance: UNCLEAR
    reasoning: Personal testimony rather than checkable factual claim.
- claim_text: Many heterosexual women support groups now operate for HIV positive individuals
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.5
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Australia has Pozhet (NSW organization for heterosexuals living with HIV) and multicultural HIV services for overseas-born populations. Various community organizations provide targeted support for women with HIV, as shown in the video's support group setting.
- claim_text: Relationships are difficult for HIV positive women due to stigma and fear of transmission
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.7
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Stigma creates barriers to disclosure and intimacy. Women with HIV report difficulty negotiating when to tell partners, and fear of infecting partners is a documented psychological burden. Studies show HIV-positive people experience discrimination in dating and relationships.
- claim_text: Deanna conceived naturally with her partner who was aware of the risks and was not infected
  is_checkable: false
  importance: 0.3
  verdict:
    overall_stance: UNCLEAR
    reasoning: Individual case that cannot be independently verified.
- claim_text: Neither of Deanna's children were infected with HIV
  is_checkable: false
  importance: 0.25
  verdict:
    overall_stance: UNCLEAR
    reasoning: Individual case history regarding specific children's health status.
- claim_text: HIV exists, it's real, and it can happen to anyone
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.85
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: HIV affects all populations regardless of sexual orientation, gender, race, or socioeconomic status. While certain populations have higher rates, anyone engaging in risk behaviors can contract HIV. Public health messaging emphasizes HIV as a risk for all sexually active people.
