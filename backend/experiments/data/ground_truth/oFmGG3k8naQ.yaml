video_title: Harvard Study Proves Fluoridated water Lowers your IQ
video_duration_seconds: 507
claims:
- claim_text: Harvard University published a study in the federal government's journal on July 27, 2012 that confirms fluoride lowers IQs
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.95
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: The core factual claim is supported, though with important context.
- claim_text: A Harvard University study published on July 26 in the National Institute of Health journal finds that fluoride lowers children's IQ
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.85
  verdict:
    overall_stance: MIXED
    reasoning: The substance of the claim is accurate with minor date discrepancies.
- claim_text: Fluoridation of water supply causes retardation in children, making children's IQs lower
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.95
  verdict:
    overall_stance: MIXED
    reasoning: While evidence supports neurotoxic potential at high exposures, the claim's applicability to standard US water fluoridation levels is contested and requires nuanced interpretation.
- claim_text: Harvard University studies published in April 2006 show a link between fluorinated water and bone cancer in boys
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.9
  verdict:
    overall_stance: MIXED
    reasoning: This refers to Elise Bassin's 2006 doctoral dissertation finding.
- claim_text: An OBGYN doctor recommended that babies be fed special water with extra fluoride for their feedings to help their teeth
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.5
  verdict:
    overall_stance: REFUTES
    reasoning: The American Dental Association (ADA) recommends ready-to-feed formula or using fluoride-free/low-fluoride water to reconstitute formula to reduce fluorosis risk.
- claim_text: Infant formula mixed with fluoridated water delivers 100-200 times more fluoride than breastmilk
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.7
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: 'Breastmilk contains very low fluoride concentrations: 0.005-0.02 ppm (5-20 ppb).'
- claim_text: People in Austin, Texas live in an area with naturally over-fluorinated water and have white spots on their teeth and act like dumbasses with low IQ
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.45
  verdict:
    overall_stance: MIXED
    reasoning: INACCURATE/UNCLEAR ELEMENTS.
- claim_text: White spots on teeth indicate fluorosis caused by too much fluoride
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.65
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Dental fluorosis manifests as white spots, streaks, or in severe cases, brown staining on tooth enamel.
- claim_text: People who are angry or afraid have lower IQs and fluoride consumption contributes to this
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.6
  verdict:
    overall_stance: REFUTES
    reasoning: This conflates two unrelated concepts without scientific basis.
- claim_text: America's children have the lowest IQs in the world due to fluoride consumption
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.85
  verdict:
    overall_stance: REFUTES
    reasoning: US students do not have the lowest IQs in the world.
- claim_text: Fluoride is absorbed through the teeth topically, not through the body by drinking it
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.75
  verdict:
    overall_stance: MIXED
    reasoning: This claim is partially correct but oversimplified.
- claim_text: Baby teeth fall out and get replaced, so it doesn't make sense to give fluoride to babies for teeth that will be lost
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.4
  verdict:
    overall_stance: REFUTES
    reasoning: Primary (baby) teeth are important for eating, speaking, and holding space for permanent teeth.
