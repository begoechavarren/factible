video_title: The Brain-Changing Benefits of Exercise | Wendy Suzuki | TED
video_duration_seconds: 781
claims:
- claim_text: A single workout immediately increases levels of neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenaline
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.9
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: True. Studies show acute exercise increases dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline. Basso & Suzuki 2017 review confirms this. Immediate effect.
- claim_text: A single workout will increase your mood right after that workout
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.75
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Yes. Single workout improves mood right after via neurotransmitter release. Well documented effect.
- claim_text: A single workout can improve your ability to shift and focus attention, and that focus improvement will last for at least two hours
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.85
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Supported. Suzuki's own lab found focus improvements lasting 2 hours after 30 min exercise. Other studies confirm attention improvements. Solid evidence.
- claim_text: A single workout will improve your reaction times
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.7
  verdict:
    overall_stance: MIXED
    reasoning: Mixed. Some studies show improved reaction time, others find no effect. Depends on intensity and timing. Not as clear as other benefits.
- claim_text: Exercise produces brand new brain cells, new brain cells in the hippocampus, that increase its volume
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.95
  verdict:
    overall_stance: MIXED
    reasoning: Mixed. In animals (mice) - yes, clear neurogenesis. In humans - controversial. Hippocampus volume increases but might not be new neurons (could be blood flow, other factors). Human neurogenesis still debated in science.
- claim_text: Exercise improves your long-term memory
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.85
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Supported. Exercise improves long-term memory in studies. Hippocampus changes linked to better memory. Well documented.
- claim_text: Exercise improves attention function dependent on your prefrontal cortex
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.9
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: True. Most common finding in studies - exercise improves prefrontal cortex-dependent attention. Well known.
- claim_text: The volume of the hippocampus increases with exercise
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.9
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: 'True. Erickson study: 1 year exercise = 2% hippocampus volume increase. Other studies confirm. Aerobic exercise is key.'
- claim_text: The prefrontal cortex and hippocampus are the two areas most susceptible to neurodegenerative diseases and normal cognitive decline in aging
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.75
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: True. These brain regions decline most with aging. Hippocampus shrinks 1-2%/year in elderly. Both vulnerable to Alzheimer's. Well known.
- claim_text: With increased exercise over your lifetime, you create the strongest, biggest hippocampus and prefrontal cortex so it takes longer for neurodegenerative diseases to have an effect
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.95
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Supported. Lifetime exercise builds bigger hippocampus/PFC = cognitive reserve. Delays dementia symptoms. Studies show 31-41% lower dementia risk with exercise. Can't cure but delays.
- claim_text: You want to get three to four times a week exercise, minimum 30 minutes an exercise session, and you want to get aerobic exercise
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.8
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Good recommendation. CDC/WHO say 150 min/week. Suzuki's 3-4 × 30min = 90-120min/week is close and within range. Aerobic exercise is important for brain.
- claim_text: The prefrontal cortex is critical for things like decision-making, focus, attention and your personality
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.6
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Basic neuroscience. Prefrontal cortex = executive control, decision-making, attention, personality. Textbook knowledge.
- claim_text: The hippocampus is critical for your ability to form and retain new long-term memories for facts and events
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.65
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Basic neuroscience. Hippocampus = memory formation for facts/events. Classic H.M. case proves this. Well known.
- claim_text: Exercise is the most transformative thing that you can do for your brain today
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.85
  verdict:
    overall_stance: MIXED
    reasoning: Mixed. Exercise is very beneficial for brain (strong evidence) but "most transformative" is subjective. Sleep, social connection also important. Can't really compare. Opinion more than fact.
- claim_text: You have two temporal lobes in your brain, the right and the left
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.3
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Basic anatomy. Yes, two temporal lobes (right and left). Simple fact.
