video_title: The life cycle of a plastic bottle
video_duration_seconds: 230
claims:
- claim_text: The plastic in bottles was formed by chemically bonding oil and gas molecules together to make monomers, which were then bonded into long polymer chains
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.7
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Oil/gas molecules bonded into monomers, then polymer chains. Plastics Europe and British Plastics Federation evidence.
- claim_text: Polymers were made into millions of pellets that were melted at manufacturing plants and reformed in molds
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.65
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Polymer gets made into pellets, then melted and molded at factories. Packaging industry sources and IAEA documentation.
- claim_text: Plastic bottles can end up in landfills where the dump expands each day as more trash comes in
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.55
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Landfills keep getting bigger because huge amounts of plastic go there (like 27M tons/year in US alone). Most plastic doesn't get recycled.
- claim_text: Rainwater flows through landfill waste and absorbs water-soluble compounds, including highly toxic ones, creating a harmful stew called leachate
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.85
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: When rainwater goes through landfills it picks up dissolved chemicals from waste creating leachate. USGS and Cornell confirm this is toxic "chemical soup". Well documented environmental issue.
- claim_text: Leachate can move into groundwater, soil and streams, poisoning ecosystems and harming wildlife
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.9
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Leachate does contaminate groundwater and soil. European Environment Agency says it has heavy metals and toxic stuff. EPA study found contamination at 30%+ of US landfill sites. Big environmental problem.
- claim_text: It can take a plastic bottle an agonizing 1,000 years to decompose in a landfill
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.8
  verdict:
    overall_stance: REFUTES
    reasoning: Actually not 1000 years. Most sources say 450 years for plastic bottles (some say 20-500 range). UN and HowStuffWorks agree on ~450. The claim exaggerates but still takes centuries anyway.
- claim_text: Plastic bottles can float to the ocean and be drawn into a massive vortex where trash accumulates, known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.9
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Great Pacific Garbage Patch is a real gyre between Hawaii and California where ocean currents trap plastic. National Geographic and NOAA confirm this.
- claim_text: The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is one of five plastic-filled gyres in the world's seas
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.75
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: 'Correct, there are 5 gyres total. NOAA lists them: North/South Atlantic, North/South Pacific, and Indian Ocean. Each has garbage patch.'
- claim_text: Ocean plastic pollution turns the water into a cloudy plastic soup
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.6
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Yes, "plastic soup" is accurate description used by scientists. It's not solid island but dispersed microplastics that make water cloudy. Nat Geo and NOAA use same metaphor.
- claim_text: Some animals, like seabirds, get entangled in the mess of plastic debris
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.85
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: NOAA says all 7 sea turtle species get entangled, plus 1/3 of seabirds and 40% marine mammals. Plastic debris is major problem for wildlife.
- claim_text: Animals mistake brightly colored plastic bits for food
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.85
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: 'Animals mistake colorful plastic for food. NOAA explains plastics float and are bright so attract animals. Example: plastic bags look like jellyfish. Over 600 species affected.'
- claim_text: Plastic makes animals feel full when they're not, so they starve to death
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.9
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Confirmed by multiple sources. Plastic blocks digestive system and makes animals feel full when they're not, so they starve. NOAA and wildlife organizations document this as cause of death.
- claim_text: Animals pass the toxins from the plastic up the food chain
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.85
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Yes, toxins from plastic accumulate as they go up food chain. Scientific studies confirm this - chemicals get concentrated in predators. Well known process.
- claim_text: Plastic is eaten by lanternfish, the lanternfish are eaten by squid, the squid are eaten by tuna, and the tuna are eaten by us
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.8
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Scripps Institute confirms lanternfish eat plastic and are eaten by squid/tuna. This is real ecological pathway that brings plastic to fish we eat.
- claim_text: Most plastics don't biodegrade, which means they're destined to break down into smaller and smaller pieces called micro plastics
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.95
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Basic, plastics don't biodegrade, just break into smaller pieces (microplastics). Sun, wind, waves keep breaking them down. UC Davis and many sources.
- claim_text: Microplastics might rotate in the sea eternally
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.7
  verdict:
    overall_stance: MIXED
    reasoning: Mostly true but "eternally" is exaggerated. Microplastics persist for centuries/millennia which is basically forever for humans. Some bacteria can degrade plastic but very slow. On human timescale they are indeed "forever".
- claim_text: Recycled plastic bottles are squeezed flat and compressed into a block, then shredded into tiny pieces, washed and melted to become raw materials that can be used again
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.9
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Correct description of the recycling process. Bottles get compressed, shredded into flakes, washed, melted into pellets. British Plastics Federation confirms these steps. Standard recycling procedure.
