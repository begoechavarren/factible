claims:
- claim_text: The greenhouse effect is a phenomenon where gases in the atmosphere let the sun's light in but keep some of the heat from escaping
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.9
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Multiple authoritative sources confirm this mechanism.
- claim_text: Greenhouse gases include water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and chlorofluorocarbons
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.85
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: All major scientific sources confirm this list.
- claim_text: The more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the more heat gets trapped, strengthening the greenhouse effect and increasing the Earth's temperature
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.95
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: This is a core scientific principle confirmed by all sources.
- claim_text: Human activities like the burning of fossil fuels have increased the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere by more than a third since the Industrial Revolution
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.9
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Since the actual increase is about 50%, the claim that it has increased "more than a third" (33%) is factually correct. While it understates the full magnitude, it is not false - 50% is indeed "more than a third." The claim is supported by the evidence.
- claim_text: Atmospheric carbon dioxide hasn't reached today's levels in hundreds of thousands of years despite past climate fluctuations
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.85
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Multiple sources confirm this timeframe.
- claim_text: Ice sheets such as Greenland and Antarctica are melting
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.9
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Overwhelming evidence confirms ice sheet melting.
- claim_text: The extra water that was once held in glaciers causes sea levels to rise and spills out of the oceans flooding coastal regions
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.85
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Evidence confirms glacial melt contributes to sea level rise.
- claim_text: Warmer temperatures make weather more extreme, meaning not only more intense major storms, floods, and heavy snowfall but also longer and more frequent droughts
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.95
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Extensive evidence supports this claim.
- claim_text: Changes in weather pose challenges to growing crops, as it becomes more difficult, the areas where plants and animals can live shift, and water supplies are diminished
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.85
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Multiple sources confirm agricultural challenges.
- claim_text: Climate change can directly affect people's physical health
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.85
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Extensive health research confirms direct impacts.
- claim_text: In urban areas, the warmer atmosphere creates an environment that traps and increases the amount of smog
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.8
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Scientific evidence confirms this mechanism.
- claim_text: Smog contains ozone particles which increase rapidly at higher temperatures
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.8
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Multiple sources confirm this relationship.
- claim_text: Exposure to higher levels of smog can cause health problems such as asthma, heart disease, and lung cancer
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.75
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Health research confirms these effects.
- claim_text: The rapid rate of climate change is caused by humans
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.95
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: 'NOAA: Steady annual increase in CO2 is a direct result of human activity.'
- claim_text: If we work to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy sources like solar and wind which don't produce greenhouse gas emissions, we might still be able to prevent some of the worst effects of climate change
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.9
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Scientific evidence supports that transitioning to renewable energy and reducing emissions can prevent worst climate impacts, though some changes are already committed.
