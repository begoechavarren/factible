video_duration_seconds: 308
claims:
- claim_text: Over five days, four million Texans lost power during what turned out to be the coldest winter storm in a half a century
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.75
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Official sources confirm millions lost power during the February 2021 winter storm.
- claim_text: Hundreds died, including an 11-year-old boy who froze to death in his sleep
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.8
  verdict:
    overall_stance: MIXED
    reasoning: Multiple sources confirm an 11-year-old boy (Cristian Pavon) died from hypothermia.
- claim_text: ERCOT later reported the state was just four minutes away from total grid collapse
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.85
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Multiple news sources confirm this exact timing.
- claim_text: From 2010 to 2020, the population of Texas increased by 4 million people
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.65
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: U.S. Census data confirms this claim.
- claim_text: The state's economy grew by 35%
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.6
  verdict:
    overall_stance: MIXED
    reasoning: Texas GDP data shows strong growth but specific 35% figure not verified.
- claim_text: While all this growth was happening, the state's reliable energy capacity was actually shrinking. Meanwhile, its unreliable energy capacity was surging. In fact, it almost tripled.
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.9
  verdict:
    overall_stance: MIXED
    reasoning: EIA data shows coal plants retired (7,400 MW from 2014-2024) affecting "reliable" capacity.
- claim_text: In 2020, Texans got 25% of their energy from renewables
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.75
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Multiple sources confirm renewables provided about 25% in 2020.
- claim_text: During the February storm, that fell to 8%, at one point reaching a deadly low of just 1.5%
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.85
  verdict:
    overall_stance: UNCLEAR
    reasoning: Multiple sources note wind turbines froze and solar panels were snow-covered.
- claim_text: That story begins in 1999, when Texas politicians on the left and the right fell in love with the idea that they could turn the state into a green energy powerhouse
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.7
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Texas did begin major renewable energy initiatives in 1999.
- claim_text: Since 2006, the state has subsidized renewable energy to the tune of $19 billion
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.8
  verdict:
    overall_stance: MIXED
    reasoning: The $19 billion figure is disputed and depends on what is counted.
- claim_text: Over the past decade, the federal government has spent over $230 billion on energy subsidies, and that doesn't even include subsidies the states give away
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.75
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Texas Public Policy Foundation report confirms this figure.
- claim_text: Compared to fossil fuel companies, for every unit of electricity generated, Washington subsidizes wind 17 times and solar 75 times more
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.85
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Multiple sources confirm renewables receive much higher per-unit subsidies.
- claim_text: Despite all this aid, renewables provide just 4 percent of the country's total energy supply
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.75
  verdict:
    overall_stance: MIXED
    reasoning: This claim conflates "electricity generation" with "total energy supply.".
- claim_text: 'The verdict is in: renewable energy is expensive and unreliable'
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.95
  verdict:
    overall_stance: MIXED
    reasoning: This is the video's central thesis and highly contested.
