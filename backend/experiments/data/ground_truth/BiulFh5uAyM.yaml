claims:
- claim_text: Trump signed the national emergency declaration on February 15, 2019
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.85
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Confirmed by multiple sources including Wikipedia (Proclamation 9844) and major news outlets (NPR, CNN, CBS). The date of February 15, 2019 is consistently reported across all sources.
- claim_text: Presidents have signed national emergency declarations many times before
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.7
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Supported by historical data. Since 1976, every president has declared multiple emergencies. Brennan Center tracked 58 declarations (1978-2019) with 31 still active as of 2019.
- claim_text: Trump's declaration is the first time a president has used emergency power to pay for policy that had already been rejected by Congress
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.95
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Confirmed as unprecedented by Brennan Center experts and Congressional Research Service. Previous emergencies addressed foreign crises, not domestic projects Congress explicitly rejected. No prior president used emergency powers to circumvent congressional appropriations in this manner.
- claim_text: In December 2018, Trump said he would refuse to sign a budget into law unless it included $5.7 billion for his proposed border wall
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.75
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: The $5.7 billion figure is consistently reported across sources (Wikipedia, NPR, CNBC, ABC). This demand preceded the December 22, 2018 shutdown when Congress refused the requested amount.
- claim_text: The government shutdown was the longest government shutdown in U.S. history
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.7
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Accurate at time of video publication. The 35-day shutdown (Dec 22, 2018 - Jan 25, 2019) surpassed the previous 21-day record from 1995-1996. Multiple sources confirm this was the longest in U.S. history at that point.
- claim_text: On February 14th, a budget was passed but it did not include funding for the border wall
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.8
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Confirmed by Congressional records. The budget passed on February 14 included $1.375 billion for border barriers, significantly less than the $5.7 billion requested. Trump signed it on February 15 before declaring the emergency.
- claim_text: The declaration allows the president to unilaterally divert billions of dollars from military construction projects to fund the border wall
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.9
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Supported by multiple sources. The declaration enabled access to $3.6 billion from DoD military construction funds. Wikipedia and news sources confirm this diversion of defense funding for wall construction.
- claim_text: On February 26th, the House of Representatives voted to block a presidential national emergency for the first time ever
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.85
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS

- claim_text: Congress would need a supermajority vote, two-thirds of both chambers, to override a presidential veto
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.65
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Constitutional fact verified in Article I, Section 7. Two-thirds majority required in both chambers (290 House votes, 67 Senate votes) to override presidential veto.
- claim_text: 16 states are suing the president for what they say is an unconstitutional use of executive power
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.75

    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Confirmed by multiple news sources. Sixteen states led by California filed suit on February 18, 2019 in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California challenging the emergency declaration.
- claim_text: The lawsuit claims the president has used a manufactured crisis to call for an emergency
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.8
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Verified in court documents and news reports. NPR and other sources quote the lawsuit's language about "manufactured crisis" and "pretext." This characterization appears consistently in legal filings.
- claim_text: Trump said 'I could do the wall over a longer period of time, I didn't need to do this, but I'd rather do it much faster'
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.9
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Direct quote verified by multiple sources (Sierra Club, NBC News, NPR) from February 15, 2019 declaration. This statement became significant evidence in legal challenges to the emergency's legitimacy.
- claim_text: President Obama issued 12 national emergency declarations
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.55
  verdict:
    overall_stance: MIXED
    reasoning: Sources show minor discrepancy. Brennan Center reports 12 declarations while Wikipedia and other sources report 13. The variation likely reflects different counting methodologies or timing of data collection.
- claim_text: President George W. Bush issued 13 national emergency declarations
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.55
  verdict:
    overall_stance: MIXED
    reasoning: Conflicting counts across sources. Reports range from 12 (Wikipedia) to 14 (Daily Signal), with Brennan Center citing 13. Inconsistency suggests variation in counting methodology.
- claim_text: President Clinton issued 17 national emergency declarations
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.55
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Consistently reported as 17 across multiple sources. Brennan Center data cited by NPR, PBS, and Wikipedia all confirm this number.
- claim_text: In addition to the recent one, there are 31 other active national emergencies which need to be renewed every year
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.6
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Confirmed by Brennan Center tracking cited in NPR, CBS, PBS. As of early 2019, 31 emergencies remained active. The National Emergencies Act requires annual renewal.
- claim_text: The oldest national emergency still in effect is from President Jimmy Carter in 1979, which were sanctions in response to the Iran hostage crisis
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.6
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Verified by Wikipedia and CBS News. Carter's November 14, 1979 emergency blocking Iranian government property in response to hostage crisis is the longest-running active emergency.
- claim_text: The U.S. Constitution doesn't explicitly give a president the right to declare a national emergency
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.65
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Confirmed by constitutional scholars and Senate historical resources. The Constitution lacks explicit provision for national emergency declarations. Presidents derive this power from Article II executive authority.
- claim_text: Presidents have taken this type of unilateral action for some time now, claiming it's part of the executive powers granted to them in the constitution
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.65
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Supported by historical precedent. Presidents since Franklin Roosevelt have asserted emergency powers through Article II executive authority. The 1976 Act codified existing practice.
- claim_text: President Woodrow Wilson was the first president to declare a national emergency during World War I
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.45
  verdict:
    overall_stance: MIXED
    reasoning: Sources show ambiguity. Wikipedia cites Wilson's 1917 proclamation as first but also notes Lincoln's Civil War emergencies. The distinction likely involves formal statutory declarations versus earlier emergency actions.
- claim_text: Franklin Roosevelt used emergency power to order the internment of over 100,000 Japanese-Americans during World War II
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.7
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: documented historical fact. Executive Order 9066 (1942) led to internment of about 120,000 Japanese Americans during WWII. Widely cited as example of emergency power abuse.
- claim_text: In the 1950s, the Supreme Court blocked President Harry Truman's attempt to nationalize the steel industry during the Korean War
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.75
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Confirmed by Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer (1952). The Supreme Court ruled against Truman's attempted seizure of steel mills during Korean War, finding no legal authority for such action.
- claim_text: Congress passed the National Emergencies Act of 1976
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.8
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Confirmed by Wikipedia, Senate archives, and legal databases. President Ford signed the National Emergencies Act on September 14, 1976.
- claim_text: The legislation formalized a president's ability to declare national emergencies but also aimed to give legislators the ability to check the president's power
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.75
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Confirmed by Senate historical documentation. The Act formalized emergency powers while creating congressional oversight mechanisms, including termination provisions through resolution.
- claim_text: The law has failed to limit presidential powers the way it intended to
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.7
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Supported by legal analysis. INS v. Chadha (1983) struck down the legislative veto provision, weakening congressional oversight. Experts note the Act has proven insufficient as intended check on executive power.
- claim_text: Emergency powers allow the president to shut down or take over radio stations
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.6
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Confirmed by Brennan Center research. Communications control is among 130+ statutory emergency powers available to presidents upon declaration.

  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.6
  verdict:
