video_title: 'Climate Change: What Do Scientists Say? | 5 Minute Video'
video_duration_seconds: 304
claims:
- claim_text: Richard Lindzen is an atmospheric physicist who has published more than 200 scientific papers
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.15
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Multiple authoritative sources confirm Lindzen's credentials and publication record.
- claim_text: Richard Lindzen taught at MIT for 30 years
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.1
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Sources confirm Lindzen's tenure at MIT.
- claim_text: During the 30 years Lindzen taught at MIT, the climate has changed remarkably little
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.75
  verdict:
    overall_stance: REFUTES
    reasoning: This claim is contradicted by temperature data from 1983-2013.
- claim_text: The IPCC acknowledged in its own 2007 report that 'The long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible'
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.85
  verdict:
    overall_stance: MIXED
    reasoning: The actual quote appears in the IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR) 2001, not the 2007 report.
- claim_text: CO2 is a greenhouse gas without which life on earth is not possible
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.5
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Multiple scientific sources confirm.
- claim_text: Adding CO2 to the atmosphere should lead to some warming
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.65
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Even climate skeptics acknowledge this basic physics. The claim is accurate.
- claim_text: Atmospheric levels of CO2 have been increasing since the end of the Little Ice Age in the 19th century
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.7
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Multiple sources confirm.
- claim_text: Over the past two centuries, the global mean temperature has increased slightly and erratically by about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit or one degree Celsius
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.8
  verdict:
    overall_stance: MIXED
    reasoning: The claim contains both accurate and potentially misleading elements.
- claim_text: Only since the 1960s have man's greenhouse emissions been sufficient to play a role in temperature changes
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.75
  verdict:
    overall_stance: REFUTES
    reasoning: Climate models and attribution studies show human influence on climate began in the early-to-mid 20th century, with stronger effects after 1950.
- claim_text: Given the complexity of climate, no confident prediction about future global mean temperature or its impact can be made
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.9
  verdict:
    overall_stance: REFUTES
    reasoning: This claim contradicts current scientific understanding.
- claim_text: The scenario that the burning of fossil fuels leads to catastrophe isn't part of what either group of scientists asserts
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.95
  verdict:
    overall_stance: REFUTES
    reasoning: This claim is contradicted by mainstream climate science.
- claim_text: Global warming provides politicians with money and power
  is_checkable: false
  importance: 0.3
  verdict:
    overall_stance: UNCLEAR
    reasoning: This is a political/motivational claim, not a factual scientific claim. It's subjective and not verifiable through scientific evidence. The claim involves speculation about motivations rather than observable facts.
- claim_text: Global warming provides environmentalists with money for their organizations
  is_checkable: false
  importance: 0.3
  verdict:
    overall_stance: UNCLEAR
    reasoning: This is a claim about motivations and funding, which is subjective and difficult to verify objectively. While environmental organizations do receive funding, the claim implies this is the primary motivation, which is speculative.
- claim_text: Over the last decade, scientists outside of climate physics have jumped on the bandwagon, publishing papers blaming global warming for everything from acne to the Syrian civil war
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.4
  verdict:
    overall_stance: MIXED
    reasoning: There have been scientific papers linking climate change to the Syrian civil war (examining drought as a contributing factor).
