video_duration_seconds: 308
claims:
- claim_text: Our planet has been experiencing more frequent and intense weather events in recent years
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.9
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: NASA (2024) and IPCC AR6 confirm frequency and intensity of extreme weather events are increasing globally, with IPCC stating it's virtually certain (>99%) for heat extremes since 1950. Yale E360 reports UN data showing climate-related disasters increased 83% from 1980-1999 to 2000-2019.
- claim_text: Human-induced global warming is a major underlying factor for extreme weather patterns
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.95
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: IPCC AR6 states it's extremely likely (>95%) that human influence is the main contributor to observed changes in heat extremes. NASA confirms human actions since the Industrial Revolution caused greenhouse gases to rise, warming the planet and worsening extreme weather. Carbon Brief (2024) analyzed 735 extreme events from 612 studies confirming human-caused climate change affects extreme weather globally.
- claim_text: Increased human consumption of fossil fuels since the industrial revolution has led to more greenhouse gases being released such as carbon dioxide and methane into Earth's atmosphere
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.85
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: IPCC AR6, NASA, and UNFCCC all confirm human-induced greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning (transportation, heat, electricity over past 150 years) are the primary cause of increased atmospheric CO2 and methane, driving climate change.
- claim_text: This has contributed to climate change in the form of increased global temperatures
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.9
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: IPCC AR6 and WHO confirm Earth's surface temperature has risen 1.53 degrees Celsius since the preindustrial period (1850-1900), with land surface air temperature increases much larger than combined land-ocean warming (0.87 degrees Celsius).
- claim_text: Hot spells have more than doubled in duration in the past 50 years
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.7
  verdict:
    overall_stance: MIXED
    reasoning: Australia's Bureau of Meteorology (2010) found record hot days more than doubled between 1960 and 2010. However, for heat wave duration globally, Nature Communications (2020) shows trends have accelerated since the 1950s but doesn't specify "more than doubled." The claim is partially supported for some metrics/regions but overstates global heat wave duration trends.
- claim_text: Heat waves are 10 times more likely now according to the UK's Met Office
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.75
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Carbon Brief (2022), Wikipedia, and Science Feedback all confirm Met Office and World Weather Attribution found the UK 2022 heatwave was made at least 10 times more likely by climate change. This is supported for the UK-specific context.
- claim_text: Droughts are becoming more common and more severe in some areas due to climate change
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.8
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: IPCC AR6 has high confidence that droughts are worsening in some regions. WHO and National Climate Assessment confirm frequency and intensity are increasing through rising temperatures, increased evaporation, and changing precipitation patterns. The qualifier "in some areas" correctly reflects regional variation in the scientific literature.
- claim_text: Increased rainfall has affected most of the world due to human-course climate change
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.75
  verdict:
    overall_stance: MIXED
    reasoning: IPCC AR6 has high confidence that intensification of heavy precipitation has occurred globally, but regional patterns vary. National Climate Assessment and NASA confirm water vapor increases have led to heavier rainfalls in many regions, though distribution is not uniform. "Most of the world" overstates geographic scope given significant regional variation.
- claim_text: The Paris agreement is a legally binding treaty that 196 parties agreed to uphold
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.65
  verdict:
    overall_stance: MIXED
    reasoning: 'UNFCCC confirms the Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty with 196 parties (195 states plus EU). However, legal scholars note its hybrid structure: procedural requirements are legally binding, but specific emissions targets are not enforceable (WEF). The claim is technically correct but oversimplifies the nature of legal obligations.'
- claim_text: The goal is to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius preferably to 1.5 degrees celsius compared to pre-industrial levels
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.85
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Paris Agreement Article 2.1 and UN Climate Change confirm the central objective is to hold temperature increase to well below 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels and pursue efforts to limit to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
- claim_text: This Baseline was partly chosen because it's the earliest period with near Global observations
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.4
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Climate science literature and IPCC reports use 1850-1900 as the preindustrial baseline because it represents the earliest period with near-global instrumental temperature observations. This is a methodological choice based on data availability.
- claim_text: In order to keep temperatures under 1.5 degrees Celsius dramatic changes need to be made namely Global CO2 emissions must be at half of their 2010 Levels by 2030 and at Net Zero or as close to no total carbon emissions as possible by 2050
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.9
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: IPCC SR1.5 (2018) and IPCC AR6 state global net CO2 emissions must decline by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 (40-60% interquartile range), reaching net zero around 2050 (2045-2055 range). Emissions must peak by 2025 and be reduced by roughly half by 2030 to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The claim's use of "half" aligns with the 45% reduction target.
