video_title: 'Proof: Worldwide Massive Flooding is All Manmade'
video_duration_seconds: 1334
claims:
- claim_text: 7.1 billion people on this planet are completely in the dark about continuous and escalating extreme weather events
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.2
  verdict:
    overall_stance: REFUTES
    reasoning: The factual component about population can be checked, and the claim about awareness is demonstrably false.
- claim_text: Decades of global geoengineering development is directly and deliberately responsible for all of the super storms, hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 1.0
  verdict:
    overall_stance: MIXED
    reasoning: 'UC Irvine 2016: 76 of 77 atmospheric scientists found NO evidence of large-scale spraying program.'
- claim_text: Water vapor is artificially introduced into the air in place of the natural evaporation stage and is artificially cooled and condensed to produce rain on a global scale
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.95
  verdict:
    overall_stance: MIXED
    reasoning: The claim contains elements that are both partially true and largely false.
- claim_text: The same primary source of CO2 emissions on this planet is the same source of artificial precipitation
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.75
  verdict:
    overall_stance: REFUTES
    reasoning: combustion, there is no evidence they are.
- claim_text: Artificial precipitation generation occurs in coordinated bursts visible on infrared satellite as superheated water vapor from no natural source
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.85
  verdict:
    overall_stance: MIXED
    reasoning: No evidence the patterns represent "coordinated bursts" of artificial precipitation.
- claim_text: Hexagonal center of vortex with flat sides proves geoengineering manufacture
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.7
  verdict:
    overall_stance: REFUTES
    reasoning: No evidence supports the claim that hexagonal patterns prove geoengineering.
- claim_text: Contrails are actually chemtrails composed of heavy metal nanoparticles and ice nucleation used to control storm systems
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.9
  verdict:
    overall_stance: REFUTES
    reasoning: 'UC Irvine/Carnegie study 2016: Surveyed 77 atmospheric scientists - 76 found NO evidence.'
- claim_text: Man-made global artificial precipitation cycle is the singular reason for massive and continuous flooding worldwide
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 1.0
  verdict:
    overall_stance: REFUTES
    reasoning: Multiple sources (NOAA, European Environment Agency, UNHCR, Oxfam) confirm flooding.
- claim_text: Mother nature and monsoons are not responsible for worldwide flooding
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.85
  verdict:
    overall_stance: REFUTES
    reasoning: Natural weather systems, enhanced by climate change, ARE responsible for flooding.
- claim_text: Cloud seeding and weather modification technology exists and is being used
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.55
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Cloud seeding technology does exist and is used in limited capacity.
- claim_text: The U.S. military used weather modification during Operation Popeye in the Vietnam War
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.4
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: 'Fortune Europe 2025: "The United States used cloud seeding during ''Operation Popeye''.'
- claim_text: Industrial facilities and power plants deliberately generate coordinated artificial precipitation on a nightly cycle
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.8
  verdict:
    overall_stance: REFUTES
    reasoning: No evidence supports coordinated nightly artificial precipitation generation.
- claim_text: Evaporation is a natural process where water changes from liquid to water vapor and enters the atmosphere
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.35
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: This is accurate basic science presented in the vintage educational film shown in video.
- claim_text: Condensation occurs when water vapor in warm air meets cold air or cold surfaces and forms water droplets
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.35
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: This is accurate basic atmospheric science.
- claim_text: Flooding events in 2024-2025 including North Carolina, Mississippi, New Mexico, and Arizona were shown in news reports
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.25
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: The video appears to include authentic news footage of real flooding events.
