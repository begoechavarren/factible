video_duration_seconds: 131
claims:
- claim_text: Democracy is a system where the citizens of a country have the power to choose their leaders and influence the decisions made by the government
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.95
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: National Geographic Education, World History Encyclopedia, Parliamentary Education Office, and Oxford Reference all confirm this definition. Democracy is government where citizens vote for representatives and participate in decision-making. The term derives from demos (people) and kratos (rule). This is an accurate, widely accepted definition.
- claim_text: The word democracy comes from ancient Greek meaning citizens power
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.75
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Wikipedia and academic sources confirm democracy combines dêmos (people/citizens) and krátos (power/rule). While the video says "citizens power" rather than "people power," this is an acceptable paraphrase of the Greek etymology.
- claim_text: In ancient Athens citizens would gather in an assembly to discuss and decide on laws and other important matters
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.8
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: World History Encyclopedia, Wikipedia, and Stanford Report confirm all male citizens could attend the assembly (ekklēsia) to discuss and vote on laws. Stanford notes 5,000-6,000 citizens regularly met in the Assembly. This accurately describes Athenian democratic practice.
- claim_text: In ancient Athens, only men who were citizens could vote while women and slaves were excluded
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.7
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: National Geographic Education, World History Encyclopedia, Wikipedia, and HISTORY.com all confirm only free men were citizens in Athens. Women, children, slaves, and resident foreigners were excluded from the political process and could not vote or hold office.
- claim_text: The French Revolution marked a significant turning point in the 18th century
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.65
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: The French Revolution (1789-1799) occurred in the late 18th century. Wikipedia, UK Parliament sources, and Britannica confirm it was a period of fundamental political and societal change with profound impacts on democracy and political thought.
- claim_text: During the French Revolution, French citizens overthrew the absolute monarchy
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.7
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Wikipedia and Britannica confirm the revolution led to the abolition of the monarchy and establishment of a republic. King Louis XVI was deposed, fundamentally transforming France from an absolute monarchy to a republic.
- claim_text: During the French Revolution, for the first time the idea of universal suffrage emerged
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.75
  verdict:
    overall_stance: MIXED
    reasoning: Universal male suffrage was proclaimed in the 1793 French Constitution and done in 1792 for the National Convention election - one of the first systems to abolish property requirements. However, the claim says "universal suffrage" when this was male-only. Women were explicitly excluded and didn't gain voting rights until 1944. Only universal male suffrage emerged, not true universal suffrage for all adults.
- claim_text: During the French Revolution, this meant that any citizen regardless of wealth could vote
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.7
  verdict:
    overall_stance: MIXED
    reasoning: The 1792-1793 system abolished property requirements for men, increasing the electorate from 200,000 to 9,000,000. However, "any citizen" is misleading - women, slaves, and foreigners were not considered citizens with voting rights. "Citizen" meant male citizens only, excluding the majority of the population.
- claim_text: During the French Revolution, women still couldn't vote at this time
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.65
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Wikipedia and Liberty, Equality, Fraternity project confirm women could not vote or hold office during the Revolution. France didn't grant women voting rights until 1944. Activists like Olympe de Gouges demanded suffrage but were rejected and even executed.
- claim_text: Over time, democratic ideas spread to many other countries
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.6
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Wikipedia documents the spread of democratic voting rights across countries in the 19th and 20th centuries. Athenian principles and the French/American revolutions inspired democratic movements globally. By mid-20th century, democracy had spread across continents, though gradually and unevenly.

- claim_text: Democracy is about giving power to the people and ensuring everyone's voice is heard
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.9
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: The etymology (demos + kratos = people power) and democratic theory both emphasize popular sovereignty and inclusive participation. Civic education sources consistently describe democracy as empowering citizens. While implementation varies, the principle of popular power and voice is foundational.
- claim_text: Democracy maintains a fair and just society
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.75
  verdict:
    overall_stance: MIXED
    reasoning: Democratic principles include equality, justice, and fairness as core values, and civic education materials emphasize democracy aims to create fair and just societies. However, whether democracy actually maintains fairness and justice is debatable - historical and contemporary democracies have exhibited significant injustices (slavery, discrimination, inequality). Democracy aspires to fairness and justice but doesn't automatically maintain it. The claim conflates ideals with practice.
- claim_text: Democracy is a system that has evolved over centuries
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.7
  verdict:

- claim_text: Democracy continues to be refined to ensure equality and justice for all
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.75
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: 'Historical evidence shows ongoing reforms: suffrage expanded from property-owning men to all adults over centuries. Civil rights movements, voting rights legislation, and constitutional amendments represent ongoing refinement. Democratic systems continue debating reforms addressing inequality. While progress is uneven and incomplete, the trajectory toward greater equality is documented.'
