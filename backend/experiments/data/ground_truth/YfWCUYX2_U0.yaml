video_title: Why does climate change matter? NASA We Asked a NASA Scientist
video_duration_seconds: 94
claims:
- claim_text: The planet's climate is changing
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.95
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: This is a foundational claim of the video and is overwhelmingly supported by scientific evidence.
- claim_text: The last years have been the warmest since modern record-keeping began
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.9
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Strongly supported by multiple authoritative sources.
- claim_text: Even a little change in temperature can have big effects
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.85
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: 'NASA Earth Observatory: "A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all of the oceans, the atmosphere, and the land masses by that much".'
- claim_text: Sea levels are rising
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.9
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: supported by satellite and tide gauge data.
- claim_text: We're seeing more extreme events like heatwaves and heavy rainfall and wildfire
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.9
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Strong scientific evidence supports increases in these extreme events.
- claim_text: A lot of those effects are going to increase with more warming
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.85
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Well-supported by climate projections and IPCC assessments.
- claim_text: Climate change is affecting decisions like farmers thinking about what crops to grow or homeowners thinking about flood risk
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.6
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Supported by documented real-world adaptation examples.
- claim_text: We know more about our planet than we have ever before
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.55
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Supported by the unprecedented scope of Earth observation systems.
- claim_text: Climate is changing due to increasing greenhouse gases from human activity
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.95
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: 'IPCC AR6 (2021): "It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land since pre-industrial times".'
- claim_text: Computer models help us understand how much climate might change in the future
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.8
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: 'NASA GISS (2020 study): "Most of the models have been quite accurate" in projecting future warming.'
- claim_text: Technologies are being developed at NASA and around the world that can help limit future warming or respond to the warming we're experiencing
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.75
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Supported by documented NASA technology transfer and research programs.
- claim_text: Earth's average temperature has risen more than 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.2 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.9
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Strongly supported by multiple temperature records.
