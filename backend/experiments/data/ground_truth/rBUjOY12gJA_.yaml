claims:
- claim_text: During your first workout, you might feel more alert and energized because ramping up your heart rate means a boost in overall blood flow and oxygen to the brain
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.65
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Multiple sources confirm exercise increases blood flow and oxygen to brain.
- claim_text: Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) will persist for about 72 hours
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.7
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: 'Wikipedia: Soreness felt most strongly 24-72 hours after exercise.'
- claim_text: You're less likely to get DOMS again as long as you continue to regularly exercise those same muscles
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.6
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Evidence confirms protective effect of regular exercise.
- claim_text: Over the next few weeks you'll slowly start to ramp up production of mitochondria via mitochondrial biogenesis
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.85
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Multiple scientific sources confirm mitochondrial biogenesis from exercise.
- claim_text: After six to eight weeks studies have shown people can increase their mitochondria by up to 50%
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.9
  verdict:
    overall_stance: REFUTES
    reasoning: While mitochondrial biogenesis does occur with exercise, the claim of "up to 50%" in just "6-8 weeks" overstates what most research shows. More typical is 10-30% over 3-6 months, with highly variable individual responses. The specific claim as stated is not well-supported by the preponderance of evidence.
- claim_text: With more mitochondria in your cells you'll start to feel more fit and your endurance will increase
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.8
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: known relationship between mitochondria and fitness.
- claim_text: Exercise programs often see a 50% dropout rate within the first six months
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.55
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Multiple sources cite 50% dropout rate within 6 months.
- claim_text: After six months people are more likely to stick with exercise programs
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.6
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Evidence supports improved adherence after 6 months.
- claim_text: By nine months of regular cardio exercise you should see about a 25% increase in your VO2 max
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.85
  verdict:
    overall_stance: MIXED
    reasoning: Most studies show 10-25% improvements depending on protocol.
- claim_text: VO2 max is a measure of fitness and refers to the rate your body can transport oxygen to your muscles for fuel
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.75
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Definition is accurate according to multiple sources.
- claim_text: A higher VO2 max means you can run faster for longer, so a 25% increase means you can run about 20% further in the same amount of time
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.7
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Evidence supports general principle though exact conversion varies.
- claim_text: After one year of regular exercise your bones will be denser which reduces your risk of osteoporosis
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.85
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: 'PMC: Exercise effective means to stimulate bone osteogenesis.'
- claim_text: Regular resistance training when combined with aerobic exercise can actually reverse the effects of osteoporosis after 12 months
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.9
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Evidence supports reversal of osteoporotic effects through exercise.
- claim_text: Older people who exercise 5 days a week for at least 30 minutes saved on average $2,500 a year in medical costs for heart related health problems
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.8
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Multiple news sources confirm this specific finding.
- claim_text: Exercise lowers the risk of developing arthritis, type-2 diabetes, dementia, and certain types of cancer like breast and colon
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.85
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: 'Dementia: Multiple studies show exercise reduces cognitive decline risk.'
- claim_text: Exercise lowers the risk of anxiety and depression by reducing levels of stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.8
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Evidence supports mental health benefits and mechanism.
- claim_text: US Department of Health recommends a minimum of 2.5 hours per week of moderately intense exercise like brisk walking or biking
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.75
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Official HHS/CDC guidelines confirm recommendation.
- claim_text: US Department of Health recommends at least 1 hour and 15 minutes each week of high intensity workouts like running and swimming sprints
