video_title: What lack of sleep does to the teenage brain - Wendy Troxel
video_duration_seconds: 379
claims:
- claim_text: Only about 1 in 10 teenagers gets the 8 to 10 hours of sleep per night recommended by sleep scientists and pediatricians
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.85
  verdict:
    overall_stance: UNCLEAR
    reasoning: CDC data shows 22-30% of teens get recommended sleep, which would be closer to 2-3 in 10.
- claim_text: Major medical organizations recommend that middle and high schools start no earlier than 8:30 a.m.
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.9
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: This claim is directly supported by official policy statements.
- claim_text: Around the time of puberty, teenagers experience a delay in their biological clock
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.85
  verdict:
    overall_stance: UNCLEAR
    reasoning: Some research suggests the circadian delay correlates with pubertal development, but causation unclear.
- claim_text: Teenagers' bodies wait to start releasing melatonin until around 11 p.m., which is two hours later than what we see in adults or younger children
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.8
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Sleep research confirms delayed melatonin onset in adolescents.
- claim_text: Waking a teenager up at 6 a.m. is the biological equivalent of waking an adult up at 4 a.m.
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.7
  verdict:
    overall_stance: UNCLEAR
    reasoning: This analogy is commonly used but difficult to verify as a precise "biological equivalent".
- claim_text: Many of the unpleasant characteristics we chalk up to being a teenager—moodiness, irritability, laziness, depression—could be a product of chronic sleep deprivation
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.75
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Research supports sleep deprivation as a contributor to these symptoms.
- claim_text: Adolescence is a period of dramatic brain development, particularly in the parts of the brain responsible for higher order thinking processes, including reasoning, problem solving, and good judgment
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.7
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: UCLA Center for Developing Adolescent research confirms dramatic brain development during adolescence.
- claim_text: Teens with sleep problems were 55% more likely to have used alcohol in the past month
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.8
  verdict:
    overall_stance: UNCLEAR
    reasoning: Generalizability to all teens unclear given regional sample.
- claim_text: For each hour of lost sleep, there was a 38% increase in feeling sad or hopeless, and a 58% increase in teen suicide attempts
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.9
  verdict:
    overall_stance: UNCLEAR
    reasoning: Generalizability from single county/year to universal claim unclear.
- claim_text: Getting five hours or less of sleep per night is the equivalent of driving with a blood alcohol content above the legal limit
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.75
  verdict:
    overall_stance: MIXED
    reasoning: The sleep-alcohol impairment comparison is well-known, but the specific threshold varies.
- claim_text: Teens from districts with later start times get more sleep
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.85
  verdict:
    overall_stance: UNCLEAR
    reasoning: While studies show this trend, the universality of the claim is uncertain.
- claim_text: School absences dropped by 25% in one district after implementing later start times
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.65
  verdict:
    overall_stance: UNCLEAR
    reasoning: Multiple studies show attendance improvements with later start times.
- claim_text: Standardized test scores in math and reading go up by 2 to 3 percentage points with later start times
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.75
  verdict:
    overall_stance: MIXED
    reasoning: Some studies show "small" academic benefits; others show no significant change.
- claim_text: Later start times produce benefits as powerful as reducing class sizes by one third fewer students
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.7
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: This comparison appears in peer-reviewed literature.
- claim_text: Car crash rates for teen drivers went down by 70% in one district that changed school start times
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.8
  verdict:
    overall_stance: UNCLEAR
    reasoning: Which specific district is unclear from the claim.
- claim_text: Only about 17.7% of public middle and high schools in the United States started school at 8:30 a.m. or later before 2014
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.6
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: This is confirmed by CDC/Department of Education data.
