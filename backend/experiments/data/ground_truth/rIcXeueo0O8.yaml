video_title: What are Greenhouse Gases and How are they Measured?
video_duration_seconds: 280
claims:
- claim_text: Greenhouse gases trap heat and energy from the Sun
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.95
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Multiple authoritative sources confirm this is the fundamental mechanism.
- claim_text: Many of the human produced gases are called greenhouse gases
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.7
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Multiple sources confirm humans produce greenhouse gases through various activities.
- claim_text: Atmospheric scientists study climate and greenhouse gases by measuring the contents of the atmosphere, much like weather stations measure wind, rainfall, or snowfall
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.8
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Multiple sources confirm atmospheric scientists use specialized instruments to measure GHG concentrations.
- claim_text: Instruments are designed to measure the molecules and components of the air
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.75
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: 'NIST: Instruments use spectroscopy to measure GHG concentrations by detecting how gases absorb specific wavelengths of light.'
- claim_text: Scientists put instruments on airplanes and fly around to different regions to collect air samples and measure them
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.85
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: 'NOAA Climate.gov: Air Resources Laboratory collects measurements from aircraft, mobile, and surface platforms.'
- claim_text: Scientists fly over farms to understand the impacts of how we grow crops on the atmosphere
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.8
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: 'NOAA AiRMAPS: Series of airborne studies investigating GHG and air pollutant emissions from agricultural sources.'
- claim_text: Fertilizer is used to grow crops, and a lot of nutrients from fertilizer go to growing crops, but not all nutrients make their way into crops and some are lost to the atmosphere
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.9
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Strongly supported by agricultural science literature.
- claim_text: Scientists fly downwind of cities to understand emissions from cars, vehicles, landfills, and power plants
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.8
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: documented in atmospheric monitoring literature.
- claim_text: Landfills emit carbon dioxide and methane as garbage decays
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.85
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: documented in waste management literature.
- claim_text: Garbage in incinerators emits carbon dioxide as a product of combustion
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.7
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: 'Massachusetts government FAQ: If garbage is burned in incinerator, it emits CO2 as product of combustion.'
- claim_text: Individual actions like being aware of leaving lights on or TV on when not using them can reduce atmospheric impact
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.55
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: 'Massachusetts FAQ: We emit CO2 when heating homes through electricity or burning natural gas/oil/wood; electricity in U.S. derived from burning natural gas or coal.'
- claim_text: Collective action that comes from awareness of the problem can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.6
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Research shows awareness and collective action are necessary for policy change and behavioral shifts.
