    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Multiple academic sources confirm this is the standard methodology.

- claim_text: In 2009, the U.S. Department of Labor released a paper that examined more than 50 peer-reviewed studies and concluded that the oft-cited 23 percent wage gap may be almost entirely the result of individual choices being made by both male and female workers

  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.7
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: While I cannot verify the exact percentages for each major from the specific Georgetown study cited, the general claim that top-paying majors are heavily male-dominated is well-supported.
