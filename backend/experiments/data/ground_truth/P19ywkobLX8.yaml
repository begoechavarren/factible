video_title: Is There Really a Climate Emergency? | 5 Minute Video
video_duration_seconds: 332
claims:
- claim_text: Heat waves in the US are now no more common than they were in 1900
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.9
  verdict:
    overall_stance: MIXED
    reasoning: Climate at a Glance data shows frequency of 95°F days in 1961-2020 was 18% lower than 1901-1960.
- claim_text: Hurricane activity is no different than it was a century ago
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.9
  verdict:
    overall_stance: MIXED
    reasoning: Some studies show increase in most intense hurricanes since 1980s.
- claim_text: Floods have not increased across the globe over more than seventy years
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.85
  verdict:
    overall_stance: MIXED
    reasoning: Some recent studies show increases in flood frequency in certain regions over 70-year period.
- claim_text: Greenland's ice sheet isn't shrinking any more rapidly today than it was 80 years ago
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.95
  verdict:
    overall_stance: REFUTES
    reasoning: Multiple studies show acceleration in melting, particularly post-2000.
- claim_text: About 60 percent of any CO2 that we emit today will remain in the atmosphere 20 years from now, between 30 and 55 percent will still be there after a century, and between 15 and 30 percent will remain after one thousand years
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.75
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: Multiple sources confirm 20-40% of CO2 emissions can persist for 1000+ years.
- claim_text: Climate models require considerable judgment in assumptions about clouds, and different modelers make different assumptions, leading to widely varying results
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.8
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: The claim is accurate regarding cloud modeling challenges and model variability, though it could be misleading if used to suggest models are unreliable overall. The statement itself is factually correct about the challenges in modeling.
- claim_text: We get over 80% of the world's energy from fossil fuels
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.6
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: This statistic is accurate based on global energy data.
- claim_text: The globe is warming, and humans are exerting a warming influence upon it
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.95
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: This claim is supported by overwhelming scientific consensus.
- claim_text: Computer climate models project what the climate will be like 20, 40, or even 100 years from now based on considerable judgment and varying assumptions
  is_checkable: true
  importance: 0.75
  verdict:
    overall_stance: SUPPORTS
    reasoning: This is an accurate description of climate modeling capabilities and limitations.
