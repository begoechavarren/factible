      "Eating whole fruits provides all the vitamins and minerals found in juice along with fiber essential for digestion and blood sugar control",
      "Whole fruits keep you fuller for longer compared to juice",
      "Diluting juice with water can reduce sugar intake while still offering some nutritional benefits",
      "Regularly drinking large amounts of juice can lead to excess calorie consumption contributing to weight gain over time",
      "The sugar in juice can contribute to cavities especially when consumed frequently throughout the day",
