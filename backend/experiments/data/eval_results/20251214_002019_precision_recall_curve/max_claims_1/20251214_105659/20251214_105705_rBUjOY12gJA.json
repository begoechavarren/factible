      "During your first workout, you might feel more alert and energized because ramping up your heart rate means a boost in overall blood flow and oxygen to the brain",
      "Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) will persist for about 72 hours",
      "You're less likely to get DOMS again as long as you continue to regularly exercise those same muscles",
      "Over the next few weeks you'll slowly start to ramp up production of mitochondria via mitochondrial biogenesis",
      "After six to eight weeks studies have shown people can increase their mitochondria by up to 50%",
      "With more mitochondria in your cells you'll start to feel more fit and your endurance will increase",
      "Exercise programs often see a 50% dropout rate within the first six months",
      "After six months people are more likely to stick with exercise programs",
      "By nine months of regular cardio exercise you should see about a 25% increase in your VO2 max",
      "VO2 max is a measure of fitness and refers to the rate your body can transport oxygen to your muscles for fuel",
      "A higher VO2 max means you can run faster for longer, so a 25% increase means you can run about 20% further in the same amount of time",
      "After one year of regular exercise your bones will be denser which reduces your risk of osteoporosis",
      "Regular resistance training when combined with aerobic exercise can actually reverse the effects of osteoporosis after 12 months",
      "Older people who exercise 5 days a week for at least 30 minutes saved on average $2,500 a year in medical costs for heart related health problems",
      "Exercise lowers the risk of developing arthritis, type-2 diabetes, dementia, and certain types of cancer like breast and colon",
      "Exercise lowers the risk of anxiety and depression by reducing levels of stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline",
      "US Department of Health recommends a minimum of 2.5 hours per week of moderately intense exercise like brisk walking or biking",
      "US Department of Health recommends at least 1 hour and 15 minutes each week of high intensity workouts like running and swimming sprints",
      "On top of aerobic exercise recommendations, take two days each week to strengthen your muscles with weights or resistance training"
