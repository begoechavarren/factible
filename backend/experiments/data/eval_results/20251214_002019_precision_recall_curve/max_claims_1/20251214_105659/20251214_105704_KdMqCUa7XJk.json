      "During the February storm, that fell to 8%, at one point reaching a deadly low of just 1.5%",
      "That story begins in 1999, when Texas politicians on the left and the right fell in love with the idea that they could turn the state into a green energy powerhouse",
      "Since 2006, the state has subsidized renewable energy to the tune of $19 billion",
      "Over the past decade, the federal government has spent over $230 billion on energy subsidies, and that doesn't even include subsidies the states give away",

      "Despite all this aid, renewables provide just 4 percent of the country's total energy supply",
      "The verdict is in: renewable energy is expensive and unreliable"
