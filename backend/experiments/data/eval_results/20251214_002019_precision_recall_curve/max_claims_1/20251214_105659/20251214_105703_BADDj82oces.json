      "White blood cells immediately respond to viruses by releasing anti-viral proteins, attacking infected cells, and recruiting backup",
      "Once inside, the virus moves towards the nucleus along with its enzymes and genetic material",
      "One of these enzymes, reverse transcriptase, converts the viral RNA into a length of DNA",
      "The viral DNA inserts into the cell's genome, forcing the cell to spew out HIV proteins and genetic material to make new copies of the virus",
      "Inside infected cells, anti-viral proteins called restriction factors work to shut down virus production",
      "Some restriction factors stop the virus from escaping the cell",
      "White blood cells called phagocytes produce neutralizing antibodies which bind to surface spikes on HIV particles and stop them entering healthy helper T-cells",
      "The greatest assault comes from killer T cells and natural killer cells which seek and destroy infected cells directly",
      "They release a protein called perforin which punches holes in infected cells, allowing enzymes to be injected triggering auto-destruction",
      "HIV disables the cell's antiviral proteins allowing new virus particles to leave the cell",
      "HIV constantly mutates inside the cell to evade protection",
      "The immune system can't fight what it can't see",
      "Eventually the immune system wears itself out - killer T cells activated for too long become exhausted and no longer respond to infection",
      "The body loses the ability to make new helper T-cells to replace those killed in the fight",
      "As a result their numbers plummet - ultimately the body becomes immunodeficient and this condition is known as AIDS",
      "Without treatment, exposure to otherwise harmless microbes can be fatal",
      "We still have no way of eliminating HIV from the body completely - there is no cure",
      "Hidden reservoirs of HIV will rebound if treatment stops",
      "Treatment with antiretroviral drugs can swing the balance, allowing the immune system to recover"
