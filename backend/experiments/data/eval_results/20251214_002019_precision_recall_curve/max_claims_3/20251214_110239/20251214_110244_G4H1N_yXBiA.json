      "The extra water that was once held in glaciers causes sea levels to rise and spills out of the oceans flooding coastal regions",
      "Warmer temperatures make weather more extreme, meaning not only more intense major storms, floods, and heavy snowfall but also longer and more frequent droughts",
      "Changes in weather pose challenges to growing crops, as it becomes more difficult, the areas where plants and animals can live shift, and water supplies are diminished",
      "Climate change can directly affect people's physical health",
      "In urban areas, the warmer atmosphere creates an environment that traps and increases the amount of smog",
      "Smog contains ozone particles which increase rapidly at higher temperatures",
      "Exposure to higher levels of smog can cause health problems such as asthma, heart disease, and lung cancer",
      "The rapid rate of climate change is caused by humans",
      "If we work to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy sources like solar and wind which don't produce greenhouse gas emissions, we might still be able to prevent some of the worst effects of climate change"
